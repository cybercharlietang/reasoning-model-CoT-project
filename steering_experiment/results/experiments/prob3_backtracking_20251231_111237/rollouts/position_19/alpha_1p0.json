    "text": " Let me think again. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? Then the next one is 1 + 3*(innermost). Let me compute that step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving on to Layer 3, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 2):\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, okay, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus three times the previous layer. Let me try to write this down more formally. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nWait a minute, 1 + 3*40 is 1 + 120, which is 121, right? Hmm, okay, moving on.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, but the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing up to L9, which is the outermost layer, we have to multiply that result by 3, right? Because the entire expression is 3 times the outermost parentheses.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let me look at the original problem: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, if I compute layer 9 as 29524, then the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572, so adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me verify my calculations step by step because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning nine layers? Wait, but when I computed up to L9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the number seems quite large. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the layers.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears before closing parentheses.\n\nLet's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n... Up to nine times.\n\nWait, actually, each time we have a 1 + 3 followed by another parenthesis. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, the total number of layers is nine, meaning that L1 is the innermost (1+3), and L9 is the outermost. So, computing up to L9 as 29524 and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I did each step right.\n\nLet me compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. But I'm a bit unsure because the number is quite large. Maybe I should check with a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1), where L0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, in this case, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, so a=3 and b=1. Wait, actually, no, because L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, the standard form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to this recurrence is L_n = a^n * L0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nWait, but in our case, L1 = 4, which is when n=1. So, perhaps L0 would be the term before L1, which would be when n=0, but in our problem, n starts at 1 with L1=4.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express the recurrence properly. Let me define L1 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, etc., up to L9.\n\nThe general solution for L_n where L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 is L_n = 3^n * C + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nTo find C and D, we can solve the recurrence equation.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^(h) = A*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^(p) = K, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's say n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which is correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, so 3^10 is (3^5)^2=243^2=59049. So, yes, L9 is (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using the formula for the linear recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me start with the innermost expression. Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, and 3*1 is 3. So, 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So, adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me verify that computation again because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 3*29524. Let me compute it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 5*3=15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's the correct computation, but just to make sure, maybe I can check the layers again. Let me go through each layer quickly again: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure with nine layers.

Wait, but looking back at the original expression, the outermost operation is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.

Maybe I can find a general formula for such nested expressions.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to model this.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nAt n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the layer number starting from 1, we can compute each layer directly.\n\nSo, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis matches the result I got by computing each layer manually, so I'm confident that this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and expanding this out, each a_n can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms. Let's see:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27\n\nAnd so on, so each a_n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, but wait, that's the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3. The sum S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly what we found earlier.\n\nSo, a_n = S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me just make sure that 3^{10} is indeed 59049.\n\nYes, 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3, 29524*3=88572.\n\nI think that's the answer. It seems a bit big, but considering how many layers there are and each multiplication by 3, it makes sense.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the method works.\n\nFor example, let's compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). That's three layers instead of nine.\n\nUsing the same approach:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 =4\n\nLayer 2:1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 + 3*13=40\n\nThen, 3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: a_3=(3^{4}-1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Then 3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, expanding:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) =3(1 +3(1 +3*4))=3(1 +3(13))=3(1 +39)=3(40)=120. Correct.\n\nSo, the method works for a smaller case, which gives me more confidence.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the original expression evaluates to 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we can compute each step systematically. Recognizing the pattern as a geometric series allows us to use a formula for efficiency, confirming the result through both step-by-step computation and the general solution of the recurrence relation.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost expression, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so Layer 1 is 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Since Layer 2 is 13, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40=120. Then, 1 + 120=121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121: Let's compute that. 120*3=360, and 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 1 + 363=364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364. Hmm, let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So adding those together: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093. Let's compute that: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So adding them up: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So adding them: 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841. Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. So, I think I did that right. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but by taking it one step at a time, I managed to compute each layer correctly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me think again. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? So that's Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving outward, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me write down each layer as I go along to see if there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute it more efficiently instead of calculating each one step by step. So, let's list out the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression starts with 3 times the first layer, right? So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. Let me verify that. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do that step by step. 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because 29524 * 3 should be 88572, right? Let me confirm:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I look at the original expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)) nine times. So, does that mean Layer 9 is the innermost, and each subsequent layer is built outward? Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let's count the number of layers:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n10. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, no, perhaps I miscounted. Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) terms.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) terms:\n\n1. The outermost 3(...)\n2. Then inside that, another 3(...)\n3. Continuing until the innermost is 3(1 + 3).\n\nWait, maybe I should count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each step adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n- Then moving outward, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 3 multiplied by a term. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n10. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that can't be right because the innermost is 1 + 3, which is just a single term, not a 3(...). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is that the expression has 9 layers of 3(...). Let me think: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))), and each time you go one layer deeper, you add another 3(...). So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is Layer 1, then each step out adds another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times I see a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time there's a 3(, that's a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n10. 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each time moving outward, it's 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, the number of layers is 9, because each time you have another 3*.\n\nSo, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can find a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think: Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, LHS: A*3^n + B\n\nSet equal to RHS: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1\n\nSo, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is 59049. Then, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to look at this. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous. So, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nAs we've already solved, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways, both by step-by-step computation and by solving the recurrence relation, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by the formula a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Solving the recurrence relation gives a closed-form solution a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9 layers, this results in a_9 = 29524. Multiplying by the outermost 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me think. Let's consider the innermost expression first. Let me write down each layer step by step. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nAnd the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, then multiply the result by 3, I'll have the answer. Let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot that.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Okay.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, hold on, 3*1093. Let me double-check that. 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 +9=3279. Yes, that's correct. Then 3279 +1=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the calculations step by step because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000 + 279=3279, +1=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840, +1=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000 + 2400=29400, +123=29523, +1=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*24=72\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\n\nLayer 2: (1+3*(Layer1))\n\nLayer 3: (1+3*(Layer2))\n\nLayer 4: (1+3*(Layer3))\n\nLayer 5: (1+3*(Layer4))\n\nLayer 6: (1+3*(Layer5))\n\nLayer 7: (1+3*(Layer6))\n\nLayer 8: (1+3*(Layer7))\n\nLayer 9: (1+3*(Layer8))\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers.\n\nSo, each layer is computed as above, leading to Layer9=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me check if I didn't make an error in the Layer9 computation. Because 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3.\n\n9841*3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29.\n\nSo, writing it down: 29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. That's correct.\n\nThen, 29524*3:\n\nCompute 29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems like the computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially since it's a repeated multiplication and addition. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4= 3C - 1/2 => 3C=4 + 1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the 9th layer is 29524, as computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a formula that allows computation without manually expanding each layer. The final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost expression, which is the last one inside the ninth set of parentheses. Let me see: The innermost is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my calculations again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, that's correct. Let me proceed. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost part is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Now, let's add those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or formula that could simplify the computation without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, so that's a_1. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is correct. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, we can see that each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe I can find a closed-form formula here. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to find a pattern or a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me compute the first few terms: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each a_n is 3 times the previous a_{n-1} plus 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. The particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), can be found by assuming a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 =4, and each subsequent layer is a_2, up to a_9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result we got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, especially with the exponents. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the closed-form formula\u2014gave me the same result.

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me write them down:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me compute this step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, I can compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again:\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572. So the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = Let's compute this:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, 88572. Yep, same result. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check each layer computation because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Let me go back through each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, all layers seem correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but I'm a bit confused because when I see the original expression, it's 3*(...), so perhaps the first layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3, but then each subsequent layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, is my approach correct? Let me think again.\n\nYes, because each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, my approach is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. If I have a nested expression where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), repeated n times, perhaps there's a geometric series or something similar involved.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_k, where k is the layer number from 1 to 9. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 40, and so on.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for L_k.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_k^{(h)} = C*3^{k}.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p.\n\nSolving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_k = C*3^{k} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for k = 1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor k = 2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for k = 3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula and see if they match my previous results.\n\nUsing L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor k=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nk=2: (27 -1)/2=13. Correct.\n\nk=3: (81 -1)/2=40. Correct.\n\nk=4: (243 -1)/2=121. Correct.\n\nk=5: (729 -1)/2=364. Correct.\n\nk=6: (2187 -1)/2=1093. Correct.\n\nk=7: (6561 -1)/2=3280. Correct.\n\nk=8: (19683 -1)/2=9841. Correct.\n\nk=9: (59049 -1)/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correctly computed using the formula. Therefore, the final result is indeed 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost layer and then compute the entire expression by multiplying by 3. The final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29524. Let me compute that step by step. 3*29524: First, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Wait, but that's breaking it down into parts. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\nNo more digits, so bring down the 8.\n\nWait, that gives me 88572. Let me check that again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7\n9\u00d73=27 \u21927, carryover 2\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst digit: 4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\nNext digit: 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\nNext digit: 9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0\n\nSo the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure that each step is correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, the final step is 3\u00d729524=88572. So, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is structured as 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )) nine times. So, each layer is 1 + 3\u00d7previous layer, and we have nine layers, right? Let me count the number of layers.\n\nWait, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3\u00d7(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, I think my earlier computation is correct with 9 layers, ending up with Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let me denote the nth layer as L_n, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nWait, this seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nTo find A and B, let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution is L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I got before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression, which is 3*L_9. Let me see:\n\nSince L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144, then 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, that's another way to look at it.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer step by step and confirm with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing a few layers using the formula and see if they match.\n\nFor n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation.\n\nSimilarly, for n=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer and \\( L_9 \\) is the outermost layer.

But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count how many times I applied the layers. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + r*(a + r*(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the equation:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\nK - 3K = 1\n-2K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Let's think about expanding the expression. Let me try expanding the innermost parentheses first.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but this seems similar to the layer approach. Maybe expanding step by step is the same as computing each layer.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times, I might represent it as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let's see. Each time we have a 1 added, and then multiplied by 3, which is then added to another 1, etc. So, perhaps each 1 contributes a certain power of 3.\n\nWait, let me try to represent the entire expression as a sum.\n\nLet me consider the expression E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine layers.\n\nIf I denote E as the entire expression, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to see if I expand each layer step by step, as I did before.\n\nBut since I've already computed it using both iterative layer-by-layer computation and using the recurrence relation, and both give me 88572, I feel confident that this is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step, just to check for any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the layers check out correctly. So, I think the answer is definitely 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer adds another power of 3. For example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next 1 by 3^7, and so on, down to the outermost 1 multiplied by 3^0=1. So, the total sum would be 3^9 + 3^8 + ... + 3^0, but wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(...), so it's more like a geometric series where each term is 1 multiplied by 3^k for k from 0 to 8, but I'm not sure if that's the exact breakdown. Let me try to express it as a sum.\n\nWait, if I consider each 1 in the layers, the first 1 (innermost) is multiplied by 3^8, the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, until the last 1 (outermost) is multiplied by 3^0. So, the sum would be 3^8 + 3^7 + ... + 3^0. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Here, n=8, so the sum would be (3^9 - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^9 is 19683, so (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but that's Layer 8. Hmm, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula here.\n\nWait, no, because each layer is built as 1 + 3*previous layer, so the sum isn't directly the geometric series. Maybe I'm confusing the layers with the exponents. Alternatively, perhaps each layer's value can be expressed as (3^{n} - 1)/2, as I found earlier. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. That seems consistent.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost out, I arrived at the final value of 88572. I also verified using a recurrence relation and a geometric series approach, both of which confirmed the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and eventually compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer**: Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Work Outward Layer by Layer**:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Compute the Final Expression**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times (Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because 29524 * 3 should be straightforward. Maybe breaking it down differently:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, that's the same as before. So 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Hmm, okay, so the total would be 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, 3*29524 is indeed 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut wait a second, that seems like a very large number. Let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of these nested expressions. Starting from the first one after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, my initial approach was correct, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. Therefore, each layer is correctly computed as above.\n\nSo, the final computation is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nThis expression resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nSo, we can write this as a recurrence relation:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n \u2265 2\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to find the closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolve for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, the nth term is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the result we got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, this confirms that Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and solving the recurrence relation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent when calculating 3^{10}. Let me confirm:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 - 1 = 59048\n\n59048 divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*29524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have to compute 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524: Let's do this step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\nThen, 9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to multiply 29524 by 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9\u00d73=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 87572.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nNext: 5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nNext: 9\u00d73=27 \u21927, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nWait, but 29524 \u00d73:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n20000\u00d73=60000\n\n9000\u00d73=27000 \u2192 60000+27000=87000\n\n500\u00d73=1500 \u2192 87000+1500=88500\n\n20\u00d73=60 \u2192 88500+60=88560\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 88560+12=88572\n\nAh, so it's 88572.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier when I multiplied digit by digit. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the digits. Let me write it out properly.\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 87572? Wait, that doesn't match the 29524\u00d73=88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a digit. Let me count the digits in 29524. It's 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nSo, when I multiply each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2.\n\nWait, that would be 88572.\n\nWait, so the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, so I think my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong because I didn't account for all the digits correctly.\n\nSo, 29524 \u00d73=88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that step by step because I don't want to make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d73 as follows:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000\u00d73=60000\n\n9000\u00d73=27000 \u2192 60000+27000=87000\n\n500\u00d73=1500 \u219287000+1500=88500\n\n20\u00d73=60 \u219288500+60=88560\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u219288560+12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nLayer 2: 1+3\u00d74=1+12=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1+3\u00d713=1+39=40.\n\nLayer 4:1+3\u00d740=1+120=121.\n\nLayer 5:1+3\u00d7121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer 6:1+3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1+3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1+3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1+3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1+3\u00d74=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1+3\u00d713=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1+3\u00d740=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1+3\u00d7121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1+3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1+3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1+3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1+3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations now. Each step follows logically, and I double-checked the multiplication at the end. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next nested term). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out:**\n   - **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3 by Layer 9**: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me start by computing the innermost expression first. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's do that multiplication step by step. 3 * 29524: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 should be 88572. Let me check that calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result would be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, I just realized that the original expression starts with 3*(...), so each layer is inside another 3*(...). So, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3 is followed by another parenthesis. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each next layer adds another 3*(...). So, let's count how many times 3(1+3(...) appears. From the expression, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(1+3(...)). Let's count the number of 3(1+3(...)) parts. The innermost is 1+3, then the next is 3(1+3(...)), and so on. So, perhaps there are 9 layers in total. Wait, but when I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, I ended up with 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. But let me check if I have the correct number of layers. Alternatively, maybe the number of layers is 8 because the innermost is 1+3, and then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The first 3( starts the expression.\n- Then, inside it, 1+3( starts the next layer.\n- Then another 1+3(, and so on, until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear? Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first layer is 3*(...\n- Inside that, 1+3*(...\n- Then another 1+3*(...\n- This continues until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears after the initial 3(.\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the first 3(, each 1 + 3( adds another layer. So, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(. Let me count the number of 1 + 3( instances:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nFrom the first 3(, the next is 1 + 3(, then another 1 + 3(, and so on. Let's count the number of 1 + 3( after the first 3(:\n\n- 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3( starts the first layer.\n2. 1 + 3( starts the second layer.\n3. 1 + 3( starts the third.\n4. 1 + 3( starts the fourth.\n5. 1 + 3( starts the fifth.\n6. 1 + 3( starts the sixth.\n7. 1 + 3( starts the seventh.\n8. 1 + 3( starts the eighth.\n9. 1 + 3( starts the ninth.\n10. Then, the innermost is 1 + 3, without another parenthesis.\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers after the initial 3(, making it 10 layers in total? That can't be right because when I computed up to Layer 9, I ended up with 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider that each \"1 + 3(\" after the first 3( adds a new layer. So, the first 3( is the outermost, and each subsequent 1 + 3( adds a new inner layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears after the first 3(.\n\nLet me count again:\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the first 3(, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count how many \"1 + 3(\" are there:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nAfter the first 3(, the next is \"1 + 3(\", then another \"1 + 3(\", and so on until the innermost. Let me count each \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. After the first 3(, the next is \"1 + 3(\" (Layer 1)\n2. Then another \"1 + 3(\" (Layer 2)\n3. Then another \"1 + 3(\" (Layer 3)\n4. Then another \"1 + 3(\" (Layer 4)\n5. Then another \"1 + 3(\" (Layer 5)\n6. Then another \"1 + 3(\" (Layer 6)\n7. Then another \"1 + 3(\" (Layer 7)\n8. Then another \"1 + 3(\" (Layer 8)\n9. Then another \"1 + 3(\" (Layer 9)\n10. Finally, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 10.\n\nWait, so actually, there are 10 layers here, not 9. That means when I computed up to Layer 9, I was missing one more layer. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by stopping at Layer 9, but actually, there are 10 layers. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, let's redefine the layers as 10 layers, starting from the innermost as Layer 1, up to Layer 10 being the outermost expression.\n\nWait, no, actually, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost as Layer 1 and work outward. So, the innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, but then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 10). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 10) = 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, that's different from what I calculated earlier. So, I think I made a mistake in the initial count of layers. Let me clarify this.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from how I'm counting the layers. Let me approach this differently. Let me consider the entire expression as a series of nested functions. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer wraps around that with another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, so Layer 10 is the innermost expression, but in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 10). So, the entire expression is 3*(88573) = 265,719.\n\nBut wait, when I first computed up to Layer 9, I had 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But that was incorrect because I didn't account for all the layers. So, now, with Layer 10 being 88573, the entire expression is 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again. The problem is: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent 1+3( adds another layer. Let's count the number of 1+3( after the first 3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nAfter the first 3(, the next is 1+3( (Layer 1), then another 1+3( (Layer 2), and so on until the innermost 1+3. So, how many 1+3( are there? Let me count:\n\n- 3( starts the expression.\n- Then 1+3( (Layer 1)\n- Then 1+3( (Layer 2)\n- Then 1+3( (Layer 3)\n- Then 1+3( (Layer 4)\n- Then 1+3( (Layer 5)\n- Then 1+3( (Layer 6)\n- Then 1+3( (Layer 7)\n- Then 1+3( (Layer 8)\n- Then 1+3( (Layer 9)\n- Then 1+3( (Layer 10)\n- Finally, the innermost is 1+3.\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers of 1+3(...). So, each layer adds another 1+3*(...), so there are 10 layers in total. Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 10, I had 88573, and then the entire expression is 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because earlier I thought there were 9 layers, but now I'm seeing 10. Let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the innermost is 1+3, and then each time you add another 3*(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times you have 3*(1+3*(...)). Let me try to visualize the expression:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1+3*(...) parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nEach step adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nFrom the original expression, after the initial 3*(, there are 9 more layers of 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(1+3*(...) after the initial 3*(:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3*(, there are 9 more 3*(1+3*(...) layers. Therefore, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 10) = 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the innermost was Layer 1, and then each subsequent layer added another 3*(...), so with 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...), making it 10 layers in total. Therefore, the final computation is 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nBut wait, let me check this again because I might be overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute each layer step by step without miscounting.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 10) = 3*88573.\n\nCalculating 3*88573:\n\nLet's compute 88573 * 3:\n\n80,000 * 3 = 240,000\n\n8,000 * 3 = 24,000 \u2192 Total so far: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 Total: 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n70 * 3 = 210 \u2192 Total: 265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n3 * 3 = 9 \u2192 Total: 265,710 + 9 = 265,719\n\nSo, 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, I think I missed that there's another layer beyond Layer 9, which is Layer 10, which brings it to 88573, and then the final multiplication by 3 gives 265,719.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 265,719.\n\nBut let me verify this because I might have miscounted the layers again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572. But that would mean there are only 9 layers, not 10. So, where is the confusion?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 29524, so the total is 3*29524 = 88572. But earlier, when I thought there were 10 layers, I added an extra layer beyond Layer 9, which might not be correct.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression again:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1: 4\n- Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n- Layer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, but in the original expression, after Layer 9, which is 1+3*(Layer 8) = 29524, there's another 1+3*(Layer 9) which is Layer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 10) = 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nBut when I first looked at the expression, I thought it ended at Layer 9, but actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the innermost is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), so the total number of layers is 10, not 9.\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is up to Layer 10, giving 88573, and then multiplying by 3 gives 265,719.\n\nBut to make sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(88573) = 265,719.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, especially if the number of layers is large. Let's see.\n\nEach layer is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nWith L(1) = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nAssume L(n) = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, L(n-1) = A*3^(n-1) + B\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, set the left-hand side equal to the right-hand side:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nThus, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\nL(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo,\n\n3A - 1/2 = 4\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\nL(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=10: (3^11 -1)/2=177147-1=177146/2=88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that matches perfectly with the manual computations. Therefore, the closed-form formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, for Layer n, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have n=10, so Layer 10 is (3^11 -1)/2 = 88573.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 10) = 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L(10)) = 3*( (3^11 -1)/2 ) = (3^12 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^12: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147, 3^12=531441.\n\nSo, 3^12 = 531,441.\n\nThen, (531,441 - 3)/2 = 531,438 / 2 = 265,719.\n\nYes, that confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 265,719.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step computation, I thought there were 9 layers, which led me to 88572, but upon re-evaluating, I realized there are 10 layers, leading to 265,719. So, I think the correct answer is 265,719.\n\nBut to make sure, let me recount the number of layers in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+3(\" after the first 3( adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3(\n\nSo, there are 10 instances of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(, meaning there are 10 layers. Therefore, the computation goes up to Layer 10, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 10) = 265,719.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 265,719.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6."

So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3. That's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4.

Hmm, let's see. 29524 times 3. 4*3 is 12, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 (since we carried over) is 8. So, putting it all together, 29524*3 is 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, it's 88572.

Hmm, let's see. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression should be 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, actually, L_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. This seems like a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, layer by layer, or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work, so I don't see any mistakes here. The final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me write down each layer and compute its value.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple. 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093. Let's break it down: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression starts with 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Let me correct that. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, each part multiplied by 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me verify this multiplication again. 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, when I broke it down earlier, I had 20000*3=60,000; 9000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. So that's correct. But when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I think I messed up the place values.\n\nWait, let me do it properly:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n= ?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 8 7 7 5 2.\n\nWait, that would be 88,752? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit approach.\n\nWait, let's write it out properly:\n\n29,524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 8 7 7 5 2. Wait, that would be 88,7752? That can't be right because 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. So I must have messed up the digit alignment.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it as:\n\n29,524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\n2 (from 4*3=12, carry 1)\n\n7 (from 2*3+1=7)\n\n5 (from 5*3=15, carry 1)\n\n7 (from 2*3+1=7)\n\n7 (from 9*3=27, carry 2)\n\n8 (from 2*3+2=8)\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. So, that's correct. So, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and each calculation checks out. So, I think the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we evaluate it from the innermost parentheses outward:\n\n1.

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2. So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 = 40. Continuing this way, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364. Let me compute that: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or recognize a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can express this recursively. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the nth layer, so a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think this is correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, 3^10 is 59049. Yep, that's correct. So, 59049 - 1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let me do this multiplication step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572.

Let me compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times the outermost layer. So, after computing L9, the entire expression is 3*L9. Let me compute that:\n\nTotal = 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again carefully.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364. 364*3: Let's compute 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the total expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3: Let's break it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems very large. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, that's nine layers, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: There are nine opening parentheses, each with a corresponding closing one. So yes, nine layers. Therefore, L9 is the outermost layer, and the total is 3*L9 = 88572.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p.\n\nSolving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's verify this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Which matches our earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recursive formula. Each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, leading to a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of this sequence, we find the outermost layer and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Define the Layers:** Let \\(L_n\\) represent the nth layer, starting from the innermost:\n   - \\(L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - \\(L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 13\\)\n   - Continue up to \\(L_9\\).\n\n3. **Use the Recursive Formula:** Each layer can be expressed as \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\).\n\n4. **Find the General Solution:** The recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}\\) has the solution \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\n5. **Compute the Outermost Layer:** For \\(n=9\\), \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\n6. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is \\(3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems straightforward. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct.

So, the final answer should be 88572. I think I did this correctly, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check a couple of layers again. Let's pick Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've solved it correctly. Each step builds upon the previous one, and by working from the innermost parentheses outward, I was able to compute each layer step by step without getting confused. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down made it manageable. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but it's always good to double-check, especially on problems that involve multiple steps and nested operations.

So, the final result would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut to make sure, let me try to compute each layer again step by step, just to check for any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here.\n\nEach layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has nine layers, it's probably easier to compute each layer step by step as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express L_n in terms of a geometric series.\n\nLet me see: The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A \u21d2 0 = 1 + 2A \u21d2 A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 manually.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 *3 = 60000\n\n9000 *3 =27000 \u2192 60000 +27000=87000\n\n500 *3=1500 \u219287000 +1500=88500\n\n24 *3=72 \u219288500 +72=88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives us 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we take 3 times 29524. Let's compute that: 3*29524. Let me break this down to make sure I don't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together, 29524 *3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute it again. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, to confirm, I can compute 29524 *3 as follows: 29524 *3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4)*3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12 = 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Each step built upon the previous one, and I double-checked each layer's computation. I didn't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer and then multiplying the outermost result by 3, we arrive at the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define L1, L2, ..., L9 where each L is the result of 1 + 3*(previous layer). Wait, but actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Hmm, that might be confusing. Maybe I should think of it as each layer is 1 + 3*(next inner layer). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check that again. Wait, no, that's correct.

Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 3*29524. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, that might not be the most efficient way.

So:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carryover 0\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carryover 0\nThen, since there are no more digits, the carryover 0 doesn't add anything.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.

Let's compute that.\n\n9841 \u00d73:\n\n1\u00d73=3\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover1\n8\u00d73=24 +1=25 \u2192 write5, carryover2\n9\u00d73=27 +2=29 \u2192 write9, carryover2\nBut wait, 9841 is 9 (thousands), 8 (hundreds), 4 (tens),1 (units). So:\n\n1\u00d73=3 \u2192 units place:3\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 tens place:2, carryover1\n8\u00d73=24 +1=25 \u2192 hundreds place:5, carryover2\n9\u00d73=27 +2=29 \u2192 thousands place:9, carryover2\nSince there are no more digits, the carryover2 becomes the next digit:2.\n\nSo, 9841\u00d73=29523. Then Layer9 is 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3\u00d729524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I first saw the problem, it seemed like each layer was 1 +3*(previous), but maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There's one after the first 3, then each subsequent layer adds another. So, let's see:\n\nStarting with 3(1+3(... So that's Layer1 inside. Then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...), which is Layer1. Then inside that, another (1+3(...), which is Layer2, and so on until the innermost (1+3). How many layers is that?\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 terms inside each other. Each time it's 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: (1+3) \u2192 Layer1\nThen: (1+3(Layer1)) \u2192 Layer2\nThen: (1+3(Layer2)) \u2192 Layer3\nContinuing until the outermost Layer9.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times (Layer9). So, the total number of layers is 9, right? Because each time we have a new 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost as Layer1, up to Layer9.\n\nWait, but when I started computing earlier, I had Layer1 as 1+3=4, then Layer2 as 1+3*4=13, etc., up to Layer9=29524. Then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that each 1+3(...) is a term, and the outermost 3 multiplies the entire expression. So, perhaps the way I approached it is correct.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe expanding the expression step by step.\n\nLet me write the expression as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote E as the entire expression, so E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWait, that's the same as the original problem. So, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, perhaps the way I computed each layer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression. Let's see, if I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ... )), it's a geometric series. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nWait, in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}, but that seems a bit confusing because the layers are nested from the inside out. Alternatively, maybe it's better to model it as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 =1 +3=4, then L_2=1 +3*4=13, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nSo, if I can find a general formula for L_n, that would help. Let me see.\n\nWe have L_1 = 4\nL_2 =1 +3*4=13\nL_3=1 +3*13=40\nL_4=1 +3*40=121\nL_5=1 +3*121=364\nL_6=1 +3*364=1093\nL_7=1 +3*1093=3280\nL_8=1 +3*3280=9841\nL_9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, each L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve it. The recurrence is L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)}=K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK =1 +3*K \u2192 K -3K =1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 \u21924 =3C -1/2 \u21923C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer9, which is n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations with exponents. 3^10 is 59049, right?\n\nYes, because 3^1=3\n3^2=9\n3^3=27\n3^4=81\n3^5=243\n3^6=729\n3^7=2187\n3^8=6561\n3^9=19683\n3^10=59049 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, 3^10=59049, so L_9=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write7\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write5, carryover1\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write8, carryover2\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8\nThere's no digit beyond 2, so we're done.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nBreak it down as (20000 +9000 +500 +20 +4) \u00d73.\n\n20000\u00d73=60000\n9000\u00d73=27000\n500\u00d73=1500\n20\u00d73=60\n4\u00d73=12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n87000 +1500=88500\n88500 +60=88560\n88560 +12=88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, that confirms it again.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Let me create a list where each element corresponds to the value of each layer. Let's define Layer 1 as the innermost 1 + 3, and Layer 9 as the outermost expression. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no. Let me check the original problem again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, actually, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break that down. 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 3(...): Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" before the first closing parenthesis. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first (1+3) is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, so that would mean 9 layers? Wait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see how many layers there are. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 1+3*(...). So, the first layer is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times we have \"1+3(\" before the first closing parenthesis. Let me write down the structure:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, my initial computation was correct: 9 layers, with Layer 1 being 1+3=4, Layer 2=1+3*4=13, Layer 3=1+3*13=40, and so on, up to Layer 9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers), a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me see. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, say a_n^p = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, yes, the closed-form formula confirms the step-by-step calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form (3^{n} - 1)/2, but in this case, since we're dealing with Layer 9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the closed-form formula aligns with the step-by-step computation.

So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. So, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Let's do this step by step. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 3*3=9 +2=11, write down 11. Wait, that seems off. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, there's no digit beyond the 9, so the carry over 2 becomes 27? Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me try again:\n\nActually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 units digit is 2, carry over 1.\n\nTens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens digit is 7.\n\nHundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds digit is 5, carry over 1.\n\nThousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands digit is 8, carry over 2.\n\nTen thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that because 3 \u00d7 29524 should be 88572. Let me check with another method. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final result should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a faster way to compute this without going through each layer? Maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern? Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSo, left side: C*3^n + D\n\nRight side: 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSetting them equal:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1\n\nSo, D = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 + D = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with the first few layers:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nSo, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n3. Calculated each layer step by step up to layer 9, resulting in 29524.\n\n4. Then multiplied by 3 to get the final result, 88572.\n\n5. Verified using a recurrence relation approach, finding a closed-form formula, and confirming the result.\n\nYes, that seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1, so that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2: 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40. Now, Layer 4 is 1 + 3 times Layer 3: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3 times Layer 4, which is 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364. Now, Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Next, Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Now, Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*524 is 1572. Wait, maybe it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let me do that: 29524 * 3. 4*3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6 +1 is 7, write down 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27 +1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6 +2 is 8. 9*3 is 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3 is 15 +2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6 +1 is 7. So, putting it all together, 29524 *3 is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carries. Alternatively, maybe I should break it down more carefully: 29524 *3. Let's compute each digit:\n\n4 *3 =12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 *3 =6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5 *3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 *3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n9 *3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 *3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 *3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but let me add it up: 29524 +29524 +29524. Let's add 29524 +29524 first: 29524 +29524. Let's add digit by digit:\n\n4+4=8\n2+2=4\n5+5=10, write down 0, carry over 1\n9+9=18 +1=19, write down 9, carry over 1\n2+2=4 +1=5\nSo, that's 59048. Now, add 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 +29524. Let's add:\n\n8+4=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n4+2=6 +1=7\n0+5=5\n9+9=18, write down 8, carry over 1\n5+2=7 +1=8\nSo, that's 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you're dealing with so many layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait, let me check Layer 5 again. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6:3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7:3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8:3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9:3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make it easier without computing each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see: Each time, we have Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let's see if I can find a general formula for Layer n. The recurrence is: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is L(n) = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the solution is L(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Therefore, L(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1)= (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L(9)= (3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Then, 59048/2=29524. That's exactly what I got before. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost expression and work our way out. So, starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, so Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's a jump. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121. Wait a second, this seems to be following a pattern. Let me see if I can spot it. Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Let me compute a few more layers to see if the pattern continues. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the final result should be 88572. Wait, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer and check my computations. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's the right answer, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach it from a different angle or look for a pattern or formula that could simplify the computation. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a nested expression where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. This kind of structure is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. Then, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, each term is defined in terms of the previous one. Since there are nine layers, we're looking for a_9, and then multiplying that by 3. So, the problem reduces to finding a_9 where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. I know that for such a recurrence, the closed-form solution can be found using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + (a_1)*(r)^{n-1}, but only if r \u2260 1. However, since r = 3 here, which is greater than 1, the formula would still apply, but we have to be careful with the signs. Wait, let me recall the exact formula. For a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (c)/(1 - k) + a_1*k^{n-1}, provided that k \u2260 1. In our case, k = 3 and c = 1. So, substituting, we get a_n = (1)/(1 - 3) + a_1*(3)^{n-1} = (1)/(-2) + 4*(3)^{n-1} = -1/2 + 4*(3)^{n-1}. Let me verify this formula with the values we have. For n=1: a_1 = -1/2 + 4*(3)^0 = -1/2 + 4*1 = -1/2 + 4 = 3.5. Wait, but we know a_1 is 4, not 3.5. That suggests an error in the formula. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in applying the formula. Let me check again. The standard solution for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is indeed a_n = (c)/(1 - k) + a_1*k^{n-1}. So, plugging in k=3 and c=1, we get a_n = (1)/(1 - 3) + a_1*(3)^{n-1} = (1)/(-2) + a_1*(3)^{n-1}. Now, let's compute a_1 using this formula: a_1 = (1)/(-2) + a_1*(3)^{0} = -1/2 + a_1*1. Rearranging, a_1 = -1/2 + a_1. Subtracting a_1 from both sides: 0 = -1/2, which is impossible. That suggests that the formula isn't directly applicable here, or perhaps I'm misapplying it. Alternatively, maybe the initial condition isn't being handled correctly. Wait, perhaps the formula is a_n = (c)/(1 - k) + (a_1 - c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1}. Let me check that. Let me derive the solution properly. The recurrence is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, with a_1 given. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*k^{n}, and a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = P. Substituting into the recurrence: P = k*P + c \u21d2 P - k*P = c \u21d2 P*(1 - k) = c \u21d2 P = c/(1 - k). So, the general solution is a_n = A*k^n + c/(1 - k). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*k^1 + c/(1 - k) \u21d2 4 = A*3 + 1/(1 - 3) \u21d2 4 = 3A + (-1/2). Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n + (-1/2) = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same answer, which confirms that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum in a geometric series, but given the structure, the recurrence relation seems the most straightforward approach. Another way to look at it is to recognize that each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a geometric progression where each term is built upon the previous one. But regardless of the approach, both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, after double-checking all my computations, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240; adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3.

So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again just to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's right.

Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524.\n\nI can see that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrived at the same result without computing each layer step by step. That was a good exercise in recurrence relations. It's reassuring that both methods give the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that the expression is a geometric series. Each layer is a term in a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. But since the recurrence relation approach worked well, maybe that's the more straightforward way here.\n\nIn any case, I'm confident that the computed value is correct. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure accuracy, especially with such a nested and repetitive structure.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1} \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2} \\)\n- ...\n- Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 8} \\)\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1.

Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 = 40. Now, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. So Layer 4 = 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So Layer 5 = 364. Next, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 = 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me calculate that: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So Layer 7 = 3280. Moving on to Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

Let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, all the layers compute correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the solution to the problem is 88,572. I think that's it. It took a while, but by breaking it down layer by layer, it wasn't too bad. I just had to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way. It's easy to slip up with large numbers, but taking it step by step helped.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step. Because computing each layer one by one is time-consuming, and if there's a formula, it would save time, especially if the number of layers is larger.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated application of the operation 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI know that for such linear recursions, we can find a closed-form solution. Let me try to derive it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer, which is more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Still, it's good to know the general formula in case the number of layers increases.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is essentially building a geometric series. Let me see if I can express the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, the total expression can be seen as a sum of terms where each term is 3^k, scaled appropriately.\n\nBut since we have nine layers, the total expression would involve 3^9, which is 19683. But our a_9 is 29524, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Hmm, that seems related.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 is 59048/2=29524, which is exactly what we have. So, the formula is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, another way to express the final answer is (3^{11} -3)/2 =88572.\n\nBut since the problem asks to compute the given expression, and we've done that, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each layer, derived a formula, and even expressed the result in terms of exponents. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me write down each layer and compute it. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay. Let's see if I can find a pattern here. Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40. Hmm, not immediately obvious, but let's compute a few more layers. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 100*3 is 300, 20*3 is 60, 1*3 is 3, so 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, maybe breaking it down differently would be easier. Alternatively, 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, let me verify that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication steps. Alternatively, using the standard multiplication method:\n\n   29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, that's nine layers. So, starting from Layer 1 as the innermost, each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. So, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Now, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost part inside the initial 3(...), the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me verify this computation step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then we can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution can be found using the formula a_n = (a_1 - d/(c-1)) * c^{n-1} + d/(c-1). In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 - 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(3-1) = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2 = (7/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2.\n\nWait, let me verify that. The standard formula for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = (a_1 - d/(c-1)) * c^{n-1} + d/(c-1). So, substituting c=3 and d=1, we get a_n = (a_1 - 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(3-1) = (a_1 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, substituting that in: a_n = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2 = (7/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (7/2)*3^{0} + 1/2 = (7/2)*1 + 1/2 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (7/2)*3^{1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I calculated a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me check. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me derive it correctly.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWait, let's check that for n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, which matches my earlier calculation of a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the nth term is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer, starting from n=1, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for the innermost layer, which is layer 1, n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nSo, using this formula, I can compute each layer directly without having to compute each step manually. That would save time, especially if there are more layers.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9 for the outermost layer. Let me compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my earlier computation of Layer 9 being 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's see: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute the final result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this makes sense. I computed each layer step by step, verified it with a formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each time we have a 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...). From the innermost to the outermost, how many layers? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). And this continues until Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, in total, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), starting from Layer 1 as 1 + 3, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression. Then, after computing Layer 9, we multiply by 3 to get the final result. Wait, no. Let me check the structure again. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on, until Layer 1 is 1 + 3. So, starting from Layer 1, compute Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, and then multiply by 3. Hmm, maybe that's the way to go. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result would be 88572. Wait, let me double-check these calculations because they're getting big, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recalculate each layer step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNow, 3*29524: Let me compute this carefully. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n24*3 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears inside the parentheses. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3. So, how many layers? Let me see: Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then, each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses: Starting after the first 3, we have 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. So, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1), up to Layer9. So, I think my initial calculation is correct, with 9 layers, ending at Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Let me try an alternative approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's see, the recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence:\n\nLn = 1 + 3*Ln-1\n\nAssume Ln = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, Ln-1 = A*3^(n-1) + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition L1 = 4. Let's compute A and B.\n\nWait, but I already have B = -1/2. Now, let's use n=1:\n\nL1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4.\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check for n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer9 is L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^10=(3^5)^2=243^2=59049.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, L9=29524, times 3 is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the final result would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with larger numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that checks out. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nEach time it's 3(1+3(...)), so starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3(1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times 3(1+3 is used.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each layer is 3(1+3(...)), and there are 9 such layers inside. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(1+3(...)). Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me count the number of times I have 1+3(...) within the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nWait, perhaps the innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 1+3*(next layer). So, if I start from the innermost, that's 1+3, which is 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's list them:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, I have 9 layers from 1 to 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous). So, 3*(Layer 9) would be the final answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute each layer step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can check the number of layers again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me look at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 appears inside. Each time, after the first 3, it's 1+3 followed by another 3(...). So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the expression is 3(1+3(...)), and inside that, each time, it's 3(1+3(...)) again.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...))\n- Inside that, another (1+3(...))\n- And so on, until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses are there? Let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3))\n\nWait, that can't be right because the innermost is 1+3), so the number of opening parentheses is 9, meaning 9 layers. So, starting from Layer 1 as 1+3, then Layer 2 as 1+3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9, which would be 1+3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I think my earlier computation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just verify one more time with a different approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which could help confirm my answer.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9, since we have 9 layers.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I used two methods: step-by-step computation of each layer and solving the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula, both leading to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives us the value of the innermost expression, which is then used to compute each subsequent layer.

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: Well, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 3 * 3 = 9, write down 9. Wait, that seems off because 29524 is a 5-digit number, but I might have miscalculated the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that's correct because 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572. So, the final value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything. I started by computing the innermost parentheses, which was 1 + 3, giving me 4. Then, each subsequent layer was computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. I went through each layer one by one, up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result, 88572. I think that makes sense. Let me check if there's a pattern or a formula that could have made this easier without computing each layer individually. Hmm, each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write out the first few terms to see the pattern:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's what I got earlier. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. To find a closed-form solution, we can solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = A*c^n + B, where B is a particular solution. Let's find the particular solution. Let's assume a steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = B. Then, B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B = 1 + 3B => 0 = 1 + 2B => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3/2) - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, either way, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation provides a closed-form formula, which confirms that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2: 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), which is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we take the result from Layer 9, which is 29524, and multiply it by 3. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, 3*4 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3, so perhaps there's a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me explore that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recursive formula where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let me solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Let me see: Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's try expanding this for a few terms to see the pattern. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, that's interesting. It seems like each a_n is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, up to 3^{n}. Let's check:\n\nFor a_1: 1 + 3 = 4. Sum of 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}. Which is a geometric series with first term 1, ratio 3, and n+1 terms.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{k} - 1)/(r - 1), where k is the number of terms.\n\nHere, r=3, k = n+1.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Which matches the formula we derived earlier.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nMultiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize the geometric series, I end up with the same answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by recognizing it as a geometric series. Each layer adds another power of 3, leading to the final computation.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). This forms a geometric progression.\n\n2. **Express as a Series**: The nth term of the series can be written as a sum of powers of 3: a\u2099 = 1 + 3 + 3\u00b2 + ... + 3\u207f.\n\n3. **Use Geometric Series Formula**: The sum of the first (n+1) terms of a geometric series with ratio 3 is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Innermost Term**: For the innermost layer (n=1), the sum is (3\u00b2 - 1)/2 = 4.\n\n5. **Iterate Through Layers**: Each subsequent layer adds another power of 3, computed using the formula up to n=9.\n\n6. **Calculate the Final Term**: For n=9, the sum is (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n7. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times this sum, resulting in 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Let's see, 29524 * 3. I can break this down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because this seems like a lot, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.

Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but when I computed Layer 9, I think I included the 3 already. Let me clarify: each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, that was 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29,524, which is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the structure again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, then wrapping it again. So, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 as 4, up to Layer 9 as 29,524, and then the total is 3*29,524, which is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then each subsequent term is defined by this recurrence relation. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as I computed earlier.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find the closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => 0 = 1 + 2K => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nAt n = 1: a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9, which is the innermost expression, is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in our earlier computation, we started with a_1 as the innermost expression, but in the original problem, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4, and each layer out adds another 3*(previous layer). So, if we have nine layers, then the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is computed as per the recurrence.\n\nWait, but in our earlier step-by-step computation, we had nine layers, each time computing a_n up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine 1+3(...) terms. So, the number of layers is nine, starting from the innermost 1+3. So, the innermost is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, up to a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 as 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without having to go through each layer step by step. It's more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since I'm just starting out, maybe I should stick to the step-by-step method to avoid confusion.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that the formula is correct. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, the total expression can be expressed as (3^{11} - 3)/2, which is the same as 88,572.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} to confirm.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049\n\n3^11 = 177,147\n\nYes, 3^11 is 177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked this enough times, so I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final result of 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times, then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."
