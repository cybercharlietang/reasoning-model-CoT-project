    "text": " So, let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost one. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3. So 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So the final result is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, all the steps seem correct. I don't see any arithmetic errors. Each layer was computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1, then moving outward. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be multiplying the previous layer by 3 and then adding 1. Let me check if that's consistent. Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, that's 121, which is 11 squared, but maybe that's just a coincidence. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute that: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Add 1, so Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. I'll break it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then add 1: 29523 +1=29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572. So 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, solving this recurrence relation might give a closed-form solution. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, would be a constant. Let me assume a particular solution is A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer is reached. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, the final value of the expression is computed as 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, perhaps I should compute Layer 1 as (1 + 3), then Layer 2 as (1 + 3*(Layer 1)), and so on. Let me try that approach. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, 1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, computing each part: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n\nSo, reading it from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2.\n\nWait, that gives me 88572, which matches my earlier result. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a (1 + 3(...)), that's a new layer. Let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, actually, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1 + 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first (1 + 3(...)), each time I see a new (1 + 3(...)), that's a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, one layer out is (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. Then, (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. And so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, but in the expression, how many times does 1 + 3 appear? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after 1 + 3, there's another (1 + 3*(...)), so the number of layers is 9. Because starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer until we reach the ninth, which is the outermost. So, yes, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost, which I correctly computed up to 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication step. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 is nested. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n5. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n6. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n7. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n9. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So, yes, I think I did compute up to the ninth layer correctly.\n\nWait, but let me check if the initial expression is indeed 9 layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1 + 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nYes, so I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could notice a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a certain formula. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth layer.\n\nLet me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, where L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1).\n\nSo, it's a recursive formula where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer.\n\nSo, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1).\n\nSo, A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B).\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition L(1) = 4.\n\nL(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, 3/2 * 3^n is (3^(n+1))/2, right? Because 3^n * 3 = 3^(n+1).\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nSo, for the ninth layer, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * (3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is indeed 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

The original expression starts with 3 times (Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems like a big number. Did I do each layer correctly? Let me double-check my calculations step by step because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting again from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, yes, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, is Layer 9 the innermost, and we work our way out? Wait, actually, when I started, I considered Layer 1 as the innermost, which is correct because each subsequent layer wraps around the previous one. So, Layer 9 is the outermost expression inside the initial 3*(...). So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my method is correct. Let's say we have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). How would that compute?\n\nCompute innermost first:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, but if I compute the original expression step by step:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Which matches.\n\nSo, my method works for a smaller version, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my step-by-step calculation is accurate, and the final answer should be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer one by one:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me check. So, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nWait, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.

Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, let me compute 3*29524. Let's break it down: 29524*3.\n\nCompute 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me just double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I don't want to make a mistake. Let me verify each layer again step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time and reduce errors.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a function of the previous term.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of layer n, where n goes from 1 to 9.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom up: 7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Wait, let me do it properly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5*3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n9*3=27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nFinally, 2*3=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result, which is good.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the entire expression as a geometric series, but since each term is wrapped in a 1 + 3*(...), it's a bit more complicated. However, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form formula was helpful because it allowed me to compute Layer 9 directly without having to compute each layer step by step, which would have been time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nSo, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and deriving a formula, I was able to compute the innermost layers efficiently and arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( n \\) ranges from 1 to 9.

Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, this seems to be growing quickly. Let's continue. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, the final result is 88,572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, perhaps I should compute each layer starting from the innermost one and work my way out. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 times 3. Let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400; 29,400 + 120 is 29,520; 29,520 + 3 is 29,523. So, 3*9841 is 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29,524. So, Layer 9 = 29,524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524 * 3. Let's do this step by step:\n\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because that's a big number, and I don't want to make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n- 0 * 3 = 0.\n- 0 * 3 = 0.\n- 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nWait, no, 29,524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, let me write it out:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, all the layers check out, and the final result is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth term.\n\nLet's denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nIn general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps I can express L_n in a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1\n\nWith L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is:\n\nL_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution, L_n^{(p)}. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nL_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nL_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nL_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\nL_7 = (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\nL_8 = (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince our problem requires computing up to Layer 9, which is L_9, we can use this formula to find L_9 directly:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 =9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute the result without having to calculate each layer step by step, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work, but the formula is definitely a time-saver.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each term is 1 + 3*(something). If I expand it, it's like a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the entire expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) =1 + 3*4=1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40\n\nBut perhaps if I write the entire expression out, it's a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers.\n\nIf I expand each multiplication, it's similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which would result in a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a finite geometric series. Let me think.\n\nIn general, such nested expressions can often be expressed as a geometric series. Let me try to see if that's the case here.\n\nLet me denote S as the entire expression. Then,\n\nS = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nBut that's recursive. Wait, but in our case, it's finite. So, perhaps I can write it as:\n\nS = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\nWith nine layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nWait, let's consider that each layer adds another factor of 3.\n\nWait, but since it's finite, the expansion would be a finite sum.\n\nLet me try expanding the entire expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 =4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, S=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of it as a sum, each term is 3^k, but since it's finite, it's a finite geometric series.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nEach time we have 1 + 3*(...), so when expanded, it's 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^{n} where n is the number of layers.\n\nBut in our case, since each layer adds another multiplication, perhaps the expansion is different.\n\nWait, actually, let's try expanding the entire expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote E = 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n\nBut since it's finite, with nine layers, E can be expressed as:\n\nE = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWhich is the same as our original problem, except we have E = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with nine layers, and the entire expression is 3*E.\n\nWait, but perhaps if I expand E, it's a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me try to see:\n\nE = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with eight layers inside.\n\nBut that's similar to E = 1 + 3*E', where E' is the expression with eight layers.\n\nBut I think this is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a sum.\n\nWait, let me try to write out the entire expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 =4\n\nThen, 1 +3*4=13\n\nThen, 1 +3*13=40\n\nThen, 1 +3*40=121\n\nThen, 1 +3*121=364\n\nThen, 1 +3*364=1093\n\nThen, 1 +3*1093=3280\n\nThen, 1 +3*3280=9841\n\nThen, 1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of each step as adding another term in a geometric progression.\n\nWait, let me consider that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nAs we saw earlier, the solution is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula is much more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut in this problem, n=9, so it's manageable either way.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, maybe it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards. Let me try that approach. So, let's start with the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost layer (Layer 1): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out (Layer 2): 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer (Layer 3): 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check my calculations again. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. That seems correct. Then, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Okay, moving on.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression starts with 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So, after computing the innermost layers up to Layer 9, which is 29524, I think that's the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by 29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. 29524 * 3: 29524 times 3. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check each layer's computation to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Sometimes, when doing multiple layers, it's easy to slip up.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's a new layer. Let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. Each additional layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: from the innermost to the outermost, it's 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, yes, Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, the final result after Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or use a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, each time, the value is 1 + 3*value_of_previous_layer.\n\nThis looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value at each layer, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nI can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1, r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(r - 1)) * (r^{n} - 1) + (a_1 - c/(r - 1)) * r^{n - 1}.\n\nWait, let me check that formula again. For a linear recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the closed-form solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where a_0 is the initial term.\n\nBut in our case, a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, let's adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nHere, r = 3, c = 1, and a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but the standard formula starts with a_0. So, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.\n\nLet me consider a_0 as the term before a_1. If I set a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches our initial a_1.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nSubstituting, r = 3, c = 1, a_0 = 1.\n\nSo, a_n = 3^{n} * 1 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nSimplify: 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, that matches all the layers I computed earlier. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, 3 * a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it more efficiently without having to compute each layer manually, which is helpful if there were more layers.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the formula for future reference.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 \\) is the innermost layer. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[ a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   a_2 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13, \\\\\n   a_3 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40, \\\\\n   a_4 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121, \\\\\n   a_5 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364, \\\\\n   a_6 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093, \\\\\n   a_7 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280, \\\\\n   a_8 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841, \\\\\n   a_9 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. The value inside the outermost parentheses is \\( a_9 = 29524 \\).\n\n4. Multiply this value by 3 to get the final result:\n   \\[ 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Okay, that's simple. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, it's increasing quickly. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, that's a big jump. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.

So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29000*3 = 87000, 524*3 = 1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the total is 88,572.

So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. I think that's correct.

Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the whole thing. So, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Well, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, no, that's breaking it down too much. Alternatively, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

I think I did this correctly, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try computing a smaller version of the problem to see if the pattern holds. Let's say, for example, if I have just 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). How would that compute? Let's compute it step by step: Innermost: 1+3=4. Next layer: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Next layer: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Then, 3*40=120. So, the result is 120. Let me compute it the long way: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, the same method works for a smaller version. Therefore, I can be confident that applying the same method to the larger problem will give the correct result.

So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to miscount or miscalculate when dealing with multiple layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, we're multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n\nThis looks like a geometric series. In fact, the expression can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, in our case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, if we have n layers, the value would be a_n, and in our case, n=9.\n\nI know that for a recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, the solution can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify that.\n\nThe standard form for a linear recurrence relation a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (c*(k^n - 1))/(k - 1). In our case, k=3 and c=1, so the formula becomes a_n = (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^n - 1)/2.\n\nBut wait, in our case, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. Let me check if this formula holds for n=1. Plugging n=1 into (3^1 - 1)/2 gives (3 - 1)/2 = 1. But a_1 is 4, not 1. Hmm, that suggests that the formula might not directly apply here, or perhaps I'm misapplying it.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial condition is different. Let's see: If I consider the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from a_0 = 1. Then, a_1 would be 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches our first layer. So, actually, the initial term a_0 is 1, and a_1 is 4, a_2 is 13, etc.\n\nSo, the general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this:\n\nFor n=0: a_0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. Correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 gives the correct value for each layer.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, I'll recompute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nThere are no more digits, so write down 27 + carry over 2: 29.\n\nWait, that seems off.

Wait, the first digit is 2 (from 4\u00d73), then 7, then 5, then 7, then 7, and then the carryover 2 would be in front. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572, which is correct. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the digits.\n\nWait, let me do it step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down the carryover 2.\n\nPutting it all together: 2 (from 4\u00d73), 7, 5, 7, 7, and then 2. Wait, that would be 27572, but that's not correct because 29524 \u00d7 3 is actually 88,572. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the alignment.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\n     29524\n   \u00d7      3\n   ---------\n     88572\n\nLet me compute each digit properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write 7, carry 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write 2 in front.\n\nWait, that would give me 27572, but that's not correct because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88,572. I must have misaligned the digits. Let me try again, perhaps I missed some digits.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it as:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\n\u00d7         3\n\n------------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88,572. Yes, that's correct. I must have miscounted the digits earlier. So, the final result is indeed 88,572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying using the recurrence relation formula, I'm confident that the solution is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, let me start by computing Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3 times Layer 1, which is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Hmm, okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 364 times 3. Let me break that down: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, that would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just quickly check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer, I computed each layer step by step, multiplying by 3 each time and adding 1. Then, I took that final result and multiplied by 3 to get the final answer. Each step seemed logical, and I broke down the multiplications into manageable parts. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be faster or more efficient. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, looking at the recursive formula: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form of a linear recurrence relation is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. In this case, c=3 and d=1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*c^n + (d/(c-1)), where A is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nSo, applying that here, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is 1/(3-1) = 1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + 1/2 = 3A + 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2, so A = (7/2)/3 = 7/6.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (7/6)*3 + 1/2 = (7/6)*3 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 1/2 = 10.5 + 0.5 = 11. Wait, but earlier I calculated a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, let's check the calculation again. If a_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2, then for n=2, it's (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (7*9)/6 + 1/2 = 63/6 + 3/6 = 66/6 = 11. But earlier, when I computed step by step, a_2 was 13. So, there must be an error in my approach. Maybe the initial condition was applied incorrectly. Let me re-examine the recurrence.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the initial condition. The general solution for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = (a_0 - d/(c-1)) * c^n + d/(c-1). Wait, in this case, our initial term is a_1 = 4, so perhaps I need to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to reindex the recurrence. Let me consider n starting at 0 for the recurrence. Let me redefine a_0 as the first term, but in our case, a_1 is the first term. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the particular solution. Let me try solving the recurrence again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, that matches my earlier step-by-step calculations. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since the original problem is 3*a_9, let's compute that. We have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. So, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the multiplication 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 *3 = 60000\n\n9000 *3 =27000\n\n500 *3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nNow, add them up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+72=88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a closed-form formula. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times the next inner term.\n2. **Compute each layer**: Starting from the innermost layer, compute each subsequent layer by substituting the result of the previous layer into the expression.\n3. **Use a closed-form formula**: Recognize that each layer follows a linear recurrence relation and derive a closed-form formula to compute the nth layer directly.\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer, which is computed using the closed-form formula.\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, perhaps I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that would be:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a lot of layers, but I think I miscounted. Let me check how many layers there are. The original problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, that would mean nine layers. Wait, but when I started computing, I went up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but that seems like a very large number. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 88572 as the final answer. Let me see if that's correct or if I missed something. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, which would be more efficient and less error-prone.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r is the common ratio and c is the constant term. In this case, r = 3 and c = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(r - 1))*(r^{n} - 1) + a_0, but wait, actually, the standard solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_0 + c/(r - 1))*(r^{n}) - c/(r - 1). Wait, let me get that right.\n\nActually, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = r*K + c => K - r*K = c => K(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r). Now, applying the initial condition. Here, a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*r + c/(1 - r) = A*3 + 1/(1 - 3) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, the first layer is a_1 = 4, which should correspond to n=1. Plugging into the formula: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Similarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches our earlier calculation. Good, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9). So, yes, that would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward way to see this. Each time you have 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series. So, maybe the entire expression can be represented as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost term, each layer adds a term that is 3 times the previous. So, the innermost is 4, then 13, then 40, etc., each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a geometric progression with ratio 3, starting from 4. Wait, but the first term is 4, then 13, which is 4*3 +1, then 13*3 +1, etc. So, the nth term is 4*3^{n-1} + (1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-2})?\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let's see.\n\nIf I have a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, as I thought earlier, and we've already solved it using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, with n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute a few layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each time you have 1 + 3*something, and that something is the next layer. So, perhaps the whole thing can be seen as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3^9, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum.\n\nWait, let's try expanding the expression. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So,\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1's and 3's. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, expanding E, it would be:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try expanding this step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me compute the innermost part first:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out, it's 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nThen, 1 +3*13=40\n\nThen, 1 +3*40=121\n\n1 +3*121=364\n\n1 +3*364=1093\n\n1 +3*1093=3280\n\n1 +3*3280=9841\n\n1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, E =3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a geometric series, the expression can be represented as:\n\nE = 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 )\n\nWait, no, because each layer is (3^{n} -1)/2, but we have 9 layers, so n=9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Then, E=3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways now, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of a geometric series, we determine that the innermost layer results in 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value of the innermost expression to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2: 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3: 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524.\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's see, 29524 * 3. Breaking it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29,524 * 3 is actually 88,572. Let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, so write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's 88,572. Hmm, but let me verify with another method. 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, but 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, but when I multiply that by 3, I get 88,572. But let me check if my layers were computed correctly because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made an error in one of the layers.\n\nLet me go back and check each layer step by step to see if I made a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me try another approach to verify because sometimes with these nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error.\n\nAlternatively, I can notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but since the number of layers is small (only 9), computing each step as I did before is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can express the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Let's denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fraction, but our initial terms are integers, so maybe this approach isn't the most straightforward here, especially since we only have a few terms to compute.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence, and its solution can be written as:\n\na_n = (a_1 - d) * r^{n-1} + d,\n\nwhere d is the particular solution we found earlier, which is -1/2, and r is the common ratio, which is 3.\n\nSo, plugging in, we get:\n\na_n = (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (9/2) * (3^{n}/3) ) = (9/2) * (3^{n}/3) = (3^{n+1}) / 2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1}) / 2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as a_1=4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as a_2=13.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the formula applies correctly here. Since the recurrence starts at n=1 with a_1=4, then for each layer, n increases by 1. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute this using the formula directly, without computing each layer, I could use the formula for a_n and then multiply by 3. But since n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. So, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, that's an interesting point. Let me compute 3^{11} and see if that gives me the same result.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, (3^{11}-3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, that's another way to compute it without having to go through each layer, which is helpful.\n\nBut since the problem is presented as a nested expression with nine layers, computing each layer step by step is a more straightforward approach, especially if I don't remember the formula off the top of my head.\n\nSo, just to recap, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4, each subsequent layer builds on that. After computing up to the ninth layer, which gives me 29524, I then multiply that by 3 to get the final result of 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

    "text": " So, let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression starts with 3 multiplied by (Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the final result should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again more carefully.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364:\n\n3*300=900\n\n3*60=180\n\n3*4=12\n\nAdding them: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093:\n\n3*1000=3000\n\n3*90=270\n\n3*3=9\n\nAdding: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280:\n\n3*3000=9000\n\n3*200=600\n\n3*80=240\n\nAdding: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841:\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*800=2400\n\n3*40=120\n\n3*1=3\n\nAdding: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let's compute that:\n\n3*29524:\n\n3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*24=72\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me verify 3*29524 using another method. Maybe multiplying 29524 by 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n9\u00d73=27 \u21927, carry 2.\n\n5\u00d73=15 +2=17 \u21927, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that matches what I got earlier. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. So, Layer 9 is the outermost one, which we computed as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a pattern.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\nSubtract 3K from both sides:\n\n-2K = 1\n\nSo, K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nSo, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the values we have.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So, the problem reduces to computing Layer 1 through Layer 9, each time using the previous layer's result. That seems manageable. Let me try computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Substituting Layer 2's value, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). That's 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). So, 1 + 3*364.

Let me compute 3*1093 first: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). So, 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). That's 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29000 is 87000, 3*524 is 1572.

So, substituting Layer 1: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2).

    "text": " So, let's try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost layer, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So that's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2. So, 1 + 3*(13). 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Layer 9, I need to multiply that result by 3.\n\nSo, the outermost operation is 3 * Layer 9. Since Layer 9 is 29524, then 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers because that seems like a lot of steps. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L(n) represent the value of the nth layer, then L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe recurrence relation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), whose solution is L(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4.\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*L(9), and L(9)=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me see if I can express the entire expression using the formula. The original expression is 3*(L(9)). Since L(9)= (3^10 -1)/2, then the expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^11 is 177147, so 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, which confirms the result.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process continues up to Layer 9, which results in 29524. The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nLooking for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1:\n\n(3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

But in this case, since each layer is nested, the formula we derived earlier is more straightforward.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified the result in multiple ways, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this.

    "text": " So, perhaps the structure is like this: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... and so on until the innermost 1 + 3)).

So, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The base case is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13, which matches. Similarly, a_3=1+3*a_2=40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's substitute n=1: a_1=4= A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We need another equation to solve for A and B. Let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2=1+3*a_1=1 + 3*4=13. Using the closed-form: a_2= A*3^2 + B=9A + B. So, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A= 9/6= 3/2. Then, from equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B=4 => 9/2 + B=4 => B=4 - 9/2= (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2= (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the closed-form formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the result I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the closed-form formula. Since each layer is a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Which is the same result. So, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer step by step. It's interesting because recognizing the pattern allows me to find a formula and compute the result more efficiently, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, with 9 layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the general approach. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen each subsequent layer wraps another 1+3 around it. So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" before the closing parentheses. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1+3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9:1+3(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers. So, n=9. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and 3*a_9=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer1=4, up to Layer9=29524.\n\n3. Multiply the final layer by 3 to get the result: 3*29524=88572.\n\n4. Alternatively, find a closed-form formula for each layer, which is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then compute a_9 and multiply by 3 to get the same result.\n\n5.

    "text": " So, perhaps I should compute Layer 1 first, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on until I reach Layer 9. Let me try that approach. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, this is getting bigger each time. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*29,524. 3*20,000 = 60,000; 3*9,000 = 27,000; 3*500 = 1,500; 3*24 = 72. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, earlier I wrote 1092 as 1,092, which is correct, but then when I wrote Layer 6 as 1093, that's correct because 3*364 is indeed 1,092, and adding 1 gives 1,093. So, Layer 6: 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093. 1,000*3=3,000; 93*3=279. So, 3,000 + 279 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000; 841*3=2,523. So, 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNow, the outermost part is 3*29,524. Let me compute that again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each step checks out. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final result is 88,572. Just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see... The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which resembles a geometric series or something similar. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple linear recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*A - 1/2 => 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572, as computed before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nIn our case, n = 9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59,049, so 3^11 = 177,147.\n\nThus, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive approach, or apply the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the multiple methods all confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the outermost value before multiplying by 3. The final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a very large number, and I might have made an error somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me verify each multiplication step because sometimes when numbers get large, it's easy to make an error.\n\nLet me recompute Layer 9: 3*9841.\n\n9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.\n\nAdding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 9 is 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's break it down again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nWait a second, these numbers look familiar. Let me see:\n\n4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524\n\nWait, these numbers seem to follow a pattern similar to powers of 3, but not exactly. Let me see:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nHmm, not quite matching. But looking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1\n\nLayer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1\n\nSo, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard methods. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier layers:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so:\n\nLayer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify 3^10 again. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, and 3^10 is indeed 59049. So, 59049 minus 1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply that by 3: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I double-checked each step, and the formula approach confirmed the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and I don't see any calculation errors when I go through each layer again. So, I think the final answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nI recall that expressions like these can sometimes be represented as geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nAnd the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. It seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes, let me verify 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from the top: 8 8 7 5 7 2.\n\nWait, that would be 887572? Wait, no, wait, let's do it properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it out:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nOkay, that's consistent with my previous calculation. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number, starting from 1.

    "text": " So, perhaps the first step is to compute the innermost Layer 1, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on. Let me try that approach. So, let's define each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. So Layer 1 is 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Let me compute that:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2):\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the inner part is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, the final computation would be:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, reading the numbers from top to bottom, it's 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, so 5 with a carryover of 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8 with a carryover of 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that with another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, I think I made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or compute incorrectly. Let's list them again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\n1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll layers check out. Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be extra cautious, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without using layers, just to see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYep, same result. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the step-by-step approach seems solid. Each layer builds on the previous one, and by carefully computing each part, I arrive at the final answer. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down makes it manageable. I was worried I might have missed a layer or miscalculated a multiplication, but going through it again confirmed that everything is correct. So, I think I'm good!\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

Let me create a table or something to keep track. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13 gives 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here, maybe. Let's keep going to see if it's consistent. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so total is 27000+2523=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, because the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let's do that: 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.

So, 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3 times Layer 6. That's 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3 times Layer 7. So, 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate that. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 times Layer 8. That's 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. The original expression is 3 times the outermost layer, which is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me calculate that step by step. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is indeed 29524. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, multiplying 29524 by 3: Let's do it another way. 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (29000 + 524) * 3. 29000 * 3 is 87000, and 524 * 3 is 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 is 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, I think I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, actually, since the recurrence is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let me solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say, K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that, let's verify this formula with our earlier layers.\n\nFor n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n = 2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n = 3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n = 4: a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is the outermost one, n = 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's a nested multiplication where each layer adds 1 and then multiplies by 3. So, starting from the innermost, it's like building up each layer by layer, which is essentially what I did initially.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression. But in this case, since each term is dependent on the previous one, it's a recursive geometric progression, which is why the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, a_9 is indeed (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute this using another method. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. So:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nSo, after verifying each step and using two different methods\u2014the iterative layer-by-layer computation and the recursive formula approach\u2014I arrive at the same final answer of 88572. I feel confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recursive approach, we determine that each layer can be represented by the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula to the outermost layer (n=9), we compute the value and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)} \\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:** Using the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\) for n=9, we find \\( a_9 = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3. Hmm, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524.

Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nWait, that seems too simple. But let's check. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is indeed 4.

Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the ninth one. So, I think I did nine layers correctly. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which is time-consuming and prone to error.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as n=1. So:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n...\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nSo, each term is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume solution is a_n = A*3^n + B\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 (correct)\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 (correct)\nFor n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 (correct)\nFor n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 (correct)\nFor n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 (correct)\nFor n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 (correct)\nFor n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 (correct)\nFor n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 (correct)\nFor n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 (correct)\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer, a_9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(59048/2) = (3*59048)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.

    "text": " So, starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that's Layer 2. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121 first. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. I can think of 9841 as 9000 + 800 + 40 + 1. So, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, that's 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, that's not the right way. Let me correct that. 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.

Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.

Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it properly: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. So, 29524 * 3 is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Hmm, but wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let's see if I can express this as a sum. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), but wait, the inner expression is similar to E itself. Wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*something. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the expression can be seen as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to write out the expansion. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Wait, I see a pattern here. Each time, we're adding another power of 3. Let me see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nWait, but that's not exactly matching the layers I computed earlier. Wait, because in Layer 2, I had 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(4) = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Similarly, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. So, yes, each Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Wait, but 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^{n} = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Hmm, that's a formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let me recall that the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to k=n of r^k is (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). In this case, r=3, so the sum is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but earlier I had L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2, which is the same as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, that's consistent. Therefore, for Layer 9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my previous calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, solve the recurrence relation, or recognize the sum of a geometric series, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

So, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)) inside each other, each time being multiplied by 3 and then added to 1.\n\nSo, I think my initial computation was correct, with 9 layers, each computed step by step.\n\nLet me just write down all the layers again with their computed values to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if there are many layers. Let me think about that.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. I think it can be solved using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients, but since it's non-homogeneous, we might need to find a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all layers up to n=9. Therefore, Layer9 is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, so 3*Layer9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That matches my previous result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 + 3 times the next inner term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's result: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 364*3, let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.

Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39, and 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.

So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2. So, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5 = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093 first. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.

Yep, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Each time, the numbers get bigger, but the pattern is consistent. By computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the final value of 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.

Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but let me verify if I did each step correctly.

Hmm, that seems right. But let me check Layer 8 again because sometimes when numbers get big, it's easy to make a mistake. So, Layer 7 was 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Then Layer 9: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here that I can recognize? Each layer seems to be following a specific sequence. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built using the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might save me time instead of computing each layer. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, since we have nine layers, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the innermost part, which is a_9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just verify once more using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving the recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. After computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula, the innermost value is found to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost expression, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 = 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 = 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the whole nested expression. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. I can break this down: 3 * 29000 = 87000, and 3 * 524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me see if I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which also matches. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. We have a_1 = 4. So, plugging n=1 into the formula: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate, but in our case, n is finite, so perhaps we can find another equation. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation step by step. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 => C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5. So, C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that approach. Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. But I think the recurrence relation approach was more straightforward here. Another way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is building a number in base 3. Wait, let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to building numbers digit by digit in base 3. For example, the first layer is 4, which is 11 in base 3 (since 1*3 + 1 = 4). The second layer is 13, which is 111 in base 3 (1*9 + 1*3 + 1 =13). The third layer is 40, which is 1111 in base 3 (1*27 +1*9 +1*3 +1=40). Wait, that's interesting. So, each layer adds another '1' in base 3. So, layer n would be represented as n+1 ones in base 3. For example, layer 1: 11 (base 3) = 4. Layer 2: 111 (base 3)=13. Layer 3:1111 (base3)=40, and so on. So, layer 9 would be 111111111 (base3). Let me compute that. 111111111 in base 3 is equal to 3^8 + 3^7 + 3^6 + ... + 3^0. The sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, from k=0 to 8. The formula for the sum is (3^9 -1)/(3-1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2=9841. Wait, but earlier I found that layer 9 is 29524, which is 3*9841. Hmm, so perhaps each layer is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. So, that matches. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k). Wait, no, actually, the outermost expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k), because the innermost layer is 1+3=4, which is sum from k=0 to1 of 3^k=1+3=4. Then each layer adds another term. So, layer 9 would be sum from k=0 to9 of 3^k? Wait, no, because layer 1 is sum from k=0 to1, layer 2 is sum from k=0 to2, etc. So, layer n is sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. So, layer 9 is sum from k=0 to9 of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to m is (3^{m+1} -1)/2. So, for m=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572. That's consistent with what I got earlier. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. The innermost layer is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\), and each subsequent layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous value. This pattern continues up to the ninth layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the ninth layer is \\(\\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

The original expression starts with 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me confirm that. The outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, yes, after computing the innermost part, each layer adds another 3*(...) until the outermost one, which is multiplied by 3.

The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n =3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A =3*A +1.\n\nSolving for A: A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9)=3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer, leading up to Layer 9, which is 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost expression: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), which is 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 times 3. Let me do that: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. So, I think that's the right answer. I don't see any errors in the steps. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.
