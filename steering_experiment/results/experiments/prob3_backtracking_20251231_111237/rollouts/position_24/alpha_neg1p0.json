So, the final step is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: First, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it step by step: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as 29,524 + 29,524 + 29,524. Let's see: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 + 29,524. Let's add them up: 59,048 + 29,524. 8 + 4 = 12, carry over 1. 4 + 2 +1=7. 0 + 5=5. 9 + 9=18, carry over 1. 5 + 2 +1=8. So, 88,572. Yep, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscount. I had nine layers starting from the innermost, right? Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miss any. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that's nine layers. I started from the innermost as Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds one more. So, Layer 1: innermost, Layer 9: outermost. So, I computed up to Layer 9, which is correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29,524=88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, this can be modeled as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is: a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, substituting into the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 - 1 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. So, a_9 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

So, the result is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try to find A and B. We have L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_p(n) = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: L(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: L(3) = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works. So, for layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9 layers, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10 first. 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the result is indeed 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression using this formula. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, in terms of L(n), where n=9, it's 3*L(9) = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11} to see if that gives the same result. 3^11 = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Yep, that's the same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or express it using the closed-form formula, I end up with the same result: 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, the final step is 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern or a formula that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer manually? Because computing each layer up to 9 seems tedious, and if I had more layers, this method would take too long. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients, but since it's non-homogeneous, we can find a particular solution and the homogeneous solution. Alternatively, since the coefficients are constant, we can solve it iteratively. Let's try expanding the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges. L_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\nWait, no, L_1 is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nHmm, these numbers look familiar. Let me see: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. These look like they're following a pattern similar to powers of 3. Let me see: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nWait, but our numbers are 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Let me see if these can be expressed in terms of 3^n plus something. Let's see:\n\nFor L_1: 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1\nL_2: 13 = 9 + 4 = 3^2 + 4\nWait, but 4 is 3^1 + 1, so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test that.\n\nFor L_1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nL_2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\nL_3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\nL_4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nL_5: (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\nL_6: (3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\nL_7: (3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\nL_8: (3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\nL_9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nWow, so the general formula for L_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. That's a neat pattern. So, if I have L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. So, this formula works. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula to find L_9 directly. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(29524) = 88572, as I calculated before. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to look at it. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, let me recap: Each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1=4. We found that L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572. Both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, the final computation would be: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 3 times 29524. Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, is the answer 88572? Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Wait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the outermost operation: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, so each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier terms. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so L9 corresponds to n=9. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

    "text": " Then, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each time, I'm taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that gives me the next layer. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost part inside the first 3(...), I need to multiply this result by 3. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, each layer builds upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1, and after nine layers, we get 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or miscalculate any layers. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that all checks out. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but let me verify one or two layers again. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. So, all layers seem to be correctly calculated. Therefore, the final result after multiplying by 3 is 88572. I think that's the answer. It seems a bit large, but considering each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added 1 repeatedly, it's reasonable that the number grows quickly. So, yeah, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition.

Wait, no. Let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. Wait, but when I numbered the layers, Layer 9 was the innermost, but perhaps I got confused. Let me try again, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me parse the expression more carefully. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3s after the opening parentheses. Each time, it's 3 times (1 + ...). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each step out adds another 3*(...). So, if I start from the innermost, I have 9 layers. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer 9. So, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 *3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 +27000=87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each step adds another layer. Let me write each step again to confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I look at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the first 3 is multiplied by the entire inner expression. So, yes, that's correct. Let me check if I have 9 layers. The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s after each opening parenthesis. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 has a 3 as the next term. Let me count the number of times 3 appears as the multiplier:\n\n1. 3*(1+3*(...))\n2. 3*(1+3*(...))\n3. 3*(1+3*(...))\n4. 3*(1+3*(...))\n5. 3*(1+3*(...))\n6. 3*(1+3*(...))\n7. 3*(1+3*(...))\n8. 3*(1+3*(...))\n9. 3*(1+3)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each with a 3 multiplier. Therefore, my calculation of 9 layers is correct. So, each Layer 1 to Layer 9 is as I computed above. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be solved using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, the sequence is L_1=4, L_2=1+3*4=13, L_3=1+3*13=40, and so on up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Since L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. If we assume L_n = A*3^n + B, then substituting into the equation: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate the coefficients: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1=4. So, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. That matches what I calculated earlier. So, L_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me just verify the calculations once more to be sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's compute L_9 again using the formula: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524 *3. Let's compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait, that seems really large. Let me double-check my calculations because that number feels a bit too big, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the outermost part is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, same result. Maybe that's correct after all. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without manually going through each layer, which would be time-consuming, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each term can be represented recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is what we had. So, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, we have nine layers, so a_9 is the value we're looking for before multiplying by 3. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursion is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. In our case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, our initial condition is a_1 = 4, so I need to adjust the formula accordingly. Let me check: The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. So, starting from n=1, a_1 = c*a_0 + d. So, a_0 would be (a_1 - d)/c = (4 - 1)/3 = 1. So, a_0 = 1. Therefore, the general formula would be a_n = 3^{n}*a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^{n}*1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Simplifying, a_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct because both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now, so I feel confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive formula, we can determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using the formula for the nth term of a geometric series, we find that the value before the outermost multiplication by 3 is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait a second, in my previous calculation, I wrote 1093 as 1,093, which is the same. So, 1 + 1,092 is 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 90*3=270; 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 3*9,841. 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. Let me compute that again: 29,524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, yes, 88,572 is the correct result. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without expanding each layer. Let me try that approach to see if I get the same result. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which resembles a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This recurrence relation can be solved. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's find A and B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^{10}=59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our previous calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and then doing that again. So, in terms of functions, it's like applying the function f(x) = 1 + 3x multiple times. Starting from x=1, then f(1)=4, f(4)=13, f(13)=40, and so on, which is exactly what I did earlier. So, whether I approach it step by step, using the recurrence relation, or recognizing it as a geometric series, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. Let's see: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I need to adjust the formula. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, starting from 4. So, each layer is 3^n + something, but the formula we derived seems accurate. So, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final step is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 3*29524: Well, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait a second, let me verify that because 3*29524 might not be 88572.

Hmm, that seems consistent. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form formula. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the closed-form formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: 3 * 20000 = 60000 3 * 9000 = 27000 3 * 500 = 1500 3 * 20 = 60 3 * 4 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, but earlier when I broke it down, I got 88572 as well. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because 88572 seems a bit high. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, maybe that's correct after all. But let me try a different approach to verify. Perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9, since there are nine layers. Let me compute a_1 through a_9 using this recursive formula.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or check with a smaller number of layers to see if the pattern holds. Let's try with a smaller number of layers to see if the formula works. For example, if we have just one layer: 3(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. Using the recursive method: a_1 = 4, 3*a_1 = 12. Correct.\n\nTwo layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Recursive: a_2 = 13, 3*a_2 = 39. Correct.\n\nThree layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3*40) = 3(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363. Recursive: a_3 = 40, 3*a_3 = 120. Wait, no, wait: Wait, in the recursive approach, a_3 = 40, so 3*a_3 = 120? But when I compute three layers manually, I get 3*121 = 363. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, when I have three layers, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, 3*(40) = 120. But when I compute it manually, I get 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. So, that's correct. So, 3*a_3 = 120, which is correct. So, my initial thought that with three layers, 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*40 = 120 is correct. So, perhaps my earlier confusion was misplaced.\n\nWait, but in the problem, we have nine layers, so a_9 = 29524, and 3*a_9 = 88572. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after verifying through multiple methods\u2014direct computation layer by layer, using a recursive formula, solving the recurrence relation, and computing the final multiplication\u2014the result is consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, plus 120=29520, plus 3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down.

So, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, that feels a bit large. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) is Layer 1: 4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) + 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, Layer 3:1 + 3*13=40, Layer 4:1 + 3*40=121, Layer 5:1 + 3*121=364, Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1093, Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=3280, Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=9841, Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and less error-prone. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Alternatively, each layer can be expressed recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches Layer 2. Similarly, f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 39 = 40, which is Layer 3. So, the general formula is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. Now, to find f(9), since the innermost layer is f(1)=4, and each subsequent layer adds another f(n). So, f(9) is the value we computed as 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524=88572. Now, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see. The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. Let's try to find the solution. The homogeneous solution: The recurrence is f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 1. The homogeneous equation is f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form f_p(n) = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, f(1)=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: f(3) = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let's see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with nine layers. Let me try to write this as a sum. Each layer adds a term that's 3^k, but it's nested, so it's more complex. Alternatively, considering that each f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found, so the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms our earlier answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating each layer. Sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to miscompute a step, which would throw off all the subsequent layers. Let me double-check each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Each step checks out. So, I think I did it correctly. Another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which is similar to a geometric series. Maybe I can model it using a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is finite (9 layers), it might be easier to compute each step as I did before. But just for fun, let me try to find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f. Perfect, the formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since the innermost layer is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier. So, both methods lead to the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two methods cross-verifying each other gives me confidence. So, yeah, that's how I would solve this problem.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break down the expression starting from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, add them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step seems to be correct. Layer 1: 1+3=4, Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then each a_n can be expressed as a geometric series. Let's see: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, yeah, each step is correct. Alternatively, the general formula for a geometric series is a_n = a_1 * r^{n-1} + (r - 1)/(r - 1), but wait, maybe that's not directly applicable here because each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give me the same result. So, yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, 29524*3.

So, the total is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an error with so many layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me verify that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, which is similar to a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. The general form of such a nested expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with n layers. In this case, n is 9 because there are nine sets of parentheses. Let me recall the formula for a geometric series. A geometric series is of the form S = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^(n-1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. However, in this problem, each term is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1, so it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define L_k as the value of the k-th layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1} with L_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. First, write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_k^{(h)} = C*3^k. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p. Substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When k=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer k, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed layers. For k=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods\u2014direct computation and solving the recurrence relation\u2014we arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, but just to be thorough, let me check the multiplication one more time: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Let me check one more layer to be sure. Let's check Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. 1092 +1=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. 29523 +1=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. So I think I've computed it correctly by expanding each layer step by step. It's a bit tedious, but breaking it down made it manageable. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, as far as I can tell. So the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9). Let's do that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember that sometimes with these nested expressions, there's a formula or a pattern that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, etc. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n instead of computing each term. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = B, where B is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence relation: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure it's correct. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each step, used both iterative computation and a closed-form formula to confirm the result, and verified each calculation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 3 times 29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29,524 * 3 = (20,000 * 3) + (9,000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (20 * 3) + (4 * 3) Wait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, I can compute it directly: 29,524 * 3. Let's do it step by step. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again because 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048; 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer again to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check the final multiplication just to be sure. 29,524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a recursive relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches our previous computation. So, a_9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 =88,572. So, both methods give the same result, which makes me confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, ultimately leading to the outermost layer being 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final answer is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it using another method or check each multiplication step. Alternatively, I can compute each layer step by step using a different approach, perhaps using a table or writing down each value as I go along. Let me try that. Starting over, writing each layer's value as I compute them: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Yep, same result. I think that's solid. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recursive formula where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, then L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's see if that works. We have L(1) = 4. Plugging n=1 into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. To find another equation, let's compute L(2). From earlier, L(2) = 13. Using the recurrence relation: L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Alternatively, using the general solution: L(2) = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Now, substitute A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: L(1) = (3^(2))/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L(9) = (3^(10))/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, L(9) = 59,049/2 - 1/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms the answer using a different method. I think this solidifies that 88,572 is the correct answer. Just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the expression using another approach, like expanding the entire product step by step. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me denote each nested part as follows: Let me start from the innermost and work my way out, but perhaps using a different notation to track each step. Let me define each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost expression, and S9 is the outermost. So, S1 = 1 + 3 = 4 S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 12 = 13 S3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 39 = 40 S4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 120 = 121 S5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 363 = 364 S6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 S7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 S8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 S9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, same result again. I think this is pretty conclusive. I've used three different methods: computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, and defining each step as S1 to S9. All methods led me to the same answer, so I feel confident that 88,572 is correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one of the layers again to check for any arithmetic errors. Let's pick Layer 6: S5 = 364, so S6 = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then, S6 = 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: S6=1093, so 3*1093=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute 29524*3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, reading the digits from bottom up: 7, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carryover 0.\nThere's a 2 at the beginning, which is 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 0 = 6, write down 6.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nLet me write it properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    \u00d7        3\n    ------------\n      ?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88,572. So, writing it out:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u21927, carryover 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 =15 \u21925, carryover1.\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2.\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo, the digits are 8 (from the first digit), 8 (second), 5 (third),7 (fourth),2 (fifth). Wait, that would be 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d73 is indeed 88,572. So, that's correct. I think I've checked it enough times, and all methods confirm that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: Well, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 12 = 13, correct.

Yep, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them: Each time I see \"1+3(\" except the last one. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. So, my computation from Layer 1 to Layer 9 is correct. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572.

So, the final step is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29,524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's correct. Maybe there's a formulaic way to approach this instead of computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. It looks like each layer is following the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We know that a_1 = 4. So, substituting n=1: 4 = A*3^{1} + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, since each term is defined in terms of the previous, we can find a homogeneous solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, using the formula, I still get the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer. I think I've solved it correctly by both iterative computation and by deriving a formula for the nth term. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's a different breakdown. Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. But 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524. Now, multiplying each part by 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait a second, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, we have a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3(...). Let's see: starting from the innermost, it's 3(...), then each layer adds another 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, so let's count them: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of 3's inside the parentheses: 3(1 + 3(...)) so the first 3 is at the outermost, then each inner 3 is part of the next layer. Let me count the number of 3's after the first one. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, after the first 3, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3's inside: 1. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 1\n2. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 2\n3. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u21923\n4. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u21924\n5. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u21925\n6. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u21926\n7. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u21927\n8. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u21928\n9. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u21929\n10. 3(1 + 3) \u219210\n\nWait, that seems like 10 layers. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I only went up to Layer 9. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of times we have 3(1 + ...). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 1) \u2192 Layer 2.\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(Layer 2) \u2192 Layer 3.\n4. 1 + 3*(Layer 3) \u2192 Layer 4.\n5. 1 + 3*(Layer 4) \u2192 Layer 5.\n6. 1 + 3*(Layer 5) \u2192 Layer 6.\n7. 1 + 3*(Layer 6) \u2192 Layer 7.\n8. 1 + 3*(Layer 7) \u2192 Layer 8.\n9. 1 + 3*(Layer 8) \u2192 Layer 9.\n10. Then, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, so actually, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9), so the layers go up to Layer 9, and then the final multiplication by 3 is outside. So, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers, and then the final 3 multiplication. So, my earlier calculation of 88572 is correct. But just to be thorough, let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's write out the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nFinal: 3*(Layer 9)\n\nYes, that's 9 layers inside, and then multiplied by 3. So, 9 layers, each computed as above, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nFinal: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent each time. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is calculated step by step until the outermost layer is reached.

Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on until there are nine layers. So, yes, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost.

Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, all the layers computed correctly, and the final multiplication is correct.

Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me think again if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after nine layers, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), which we computed as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on, as I did before. Alternatively, this recurrence can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121, correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, let's compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. So, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. So, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524. Let's compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Let me just check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression has nine layers, right? Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each time I added a layer, and I ended up at Layer 9. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me consider that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}. Wait, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Let me think again. For a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found by iterating the recurrence or using the formula. Alternatively, we can write it as a_n = (c/(k-1))*(k^{n} - 1) + a_0*k^{n}, but I might be mixing up the terms. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each term as I did before, since the number of layers isn't too large. But maybe using the formula can save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me try that approach. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = A*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as we computed earlier. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me see if I can compute this another way, perhaps by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding this, the entire expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand it fully, it would be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms. Wait, but actually, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me think: The innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3*3. Then, next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer adds another power of 3. So, perhaps the entire expression is a sum of powers of 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^9, but scaled by some factor. Wait, but let me see: Let me try to expand the expression step by step. Let me denote the entire expression as E. E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's expand this from the innermost parentheses. Starting with the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, as I did before, each layer adds another term. But if I expand E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this fully. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen E = 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, and E = 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see:\n\nEach time we have 1 + 3*(something). So, when we expand all the parentheses, each layer adds a term that is 3^k, where k increases by 1 each layer. Let me try to see how many terms there are.\n\nWait, starting from the innermost, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nSimilarly, L3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, each layer adds another power of 3. Therefore, L9 would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9.\n\nWait, but that's a geometric series. The sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9 = (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, L9 is indeed 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, E = 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms multiplied by some coefficients. But I think the way I've approached it so far is sufficient.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize that the expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. Start computing each layer from the innermost one outward.\n\n3. After computing each layer, substitute its value into the next outer layer until reaching the outermost expression.\n\n4. Once all layers are computed, multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\n5. Additionally, I verified the result using a formula derived from solving the linear recurrence relation, which gave the same result.\n\n6. Lastly, I recognized the pattern as a geometric series and confirmed that the sum of the series up to 3^9 is indeed 29524, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all possible ways to approach this problem, and all methods point to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by recognizing the repeating pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = ? Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: I can break it down as 3*29000 + 3*524. 3*29000 = 87000. 3*524: 524*3, let's compute that: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500+72=1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's go back through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNow, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that's the same as before. So, maybe I didn't make a mistake. But just to be thorough, let me check the multiplication another way. 29524 * 3: 29524*3 can be thought of as (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that works out too. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )) eight times. So, I started with Layer 1 as 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after nine layers, I get 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. That's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall: For a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + initial term. Wait, let's see. The homogeneous solution would be a_n = A*r^n, and the particular solution would be a constant. So, let's solve the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula checks out with the step-by-step computations. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, the innermost layer, which is layer 1, is (3^{2} -1)/2=4, which matches. So, the outermost layer, which is layer 9, is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this, so 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula directly, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the cross-verification using the formula supports the result.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let me do this step by step: 29524 * 3. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because sometimes when I carry over, I might make a mistake.

Therefore, the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). This kind of structure often leads to a geometric series or can be represented recursively. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, the recurrence relation would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3 times the previous a. So, this is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. Given the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, this method using the recurrence relation gives the same result, which is good. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize the expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), which can be seen as a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. So, if I unroll the expression, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is a geometric series with ratio 3. The number of terms would correspond to the number of layers. But in this case, since it's nested nine times, it's a finite geometric series. The formula for the sum of a finite geometric series is S_n = a1*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In this case, though, the expression is a bit different because each term is 1, not 3^k. Wait, maybe I can represent the entire expression in terms of a geometric series. Let me think. The innermost term is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding this, the entire expression would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Let's take a smaller example. Suppose I have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Let's compute this step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 3*4 = 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Wait, but if I expand it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, if I expand it as 1 + 3 + 3^2, that would be 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, but that's not matching. Wait, no, perhaps the expansion is different. Let me see. Let me consider a simpler case with just two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Let me compute it step by step: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 3*4 = 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, if I expand the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, if I consider it as 1 + 3 + 3^2, that would be 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is the value before the final multiplication by 3. So, in this case, the expression inside the outermost 3 is 1 + 3 + 3^2. Similarly, with three layers, it would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3, and so on. Wait, but in the two-layer example, the innermost was 1 + 3, which is 4, then multiplied by 3 to get 12, then added 1 to get 13, which is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. So, indeed, each layer adds another power of 3. Therefore, in the original problem, with nine layers, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another power of 3. So, the expression inside the outermost 3 is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. Wait, let's see. Each time you go out a layer, you add another power of 3. So, with nine layers, the innermost is 1 + 3^1, then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3^1) = 1 + 3 + 3^2, and so on, up to 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9. Wait, no, let me count the layers again. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 3^1. Then, each layer out adds another power. So, the expression inside the outermost 3 would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3^9...)). Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as a geometric series with n terms. Let me try to see: If I have k layers, then the expression inside the outermost 3 would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{k}. So, in this case, with nine layers, k would be 9. Therefore, the sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9. Then, the entire expression is 3*S. Wait, but in the two-layer example, the sum inside was 1 + 3 + 3^2, which is S = (3^3 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches. Then, the entire expression is 3*S = 3*13 = 39, which matches the two-layer example. So, in the original problem, with nine layers, the sum inside would be S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9. The number of terms here is 10, from 3^0 to 3^9. The sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. Here, r = 3, n = 10. So, S = (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*S = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I computed earlier. So, this method using the geometric series formula also leads to the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, and then recognizing that this is a linear recurrence that can be solved as I did before, leading to a closed-form expression. Either way, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize the geometric series, I arrive at the same final value of 88572. Therefore, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe can break this down layer by layer, starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing each layer, we find that the value of the innermost expression up to the ninth layer is 29524. The entire expression is then 3 times this value:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the given expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
