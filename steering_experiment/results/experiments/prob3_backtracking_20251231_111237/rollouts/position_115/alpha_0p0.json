Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. By iteratively calculating each layer, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, ultimately leading to the outermost expression being multiplied by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we arrive at the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).\n2. **Compute innermost layer**: Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n3. **Iterate outward**: For each subsequent layer, compute 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer):\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"
