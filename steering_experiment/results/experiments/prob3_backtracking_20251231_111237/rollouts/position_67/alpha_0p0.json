    "text": " So, writing it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, so 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems to be correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, it's manageable manually. But if it were deeper, I might look for a recursive formula or a geometric series approach. Let me think about that for a moment.\n\nEach layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^(h) = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^(p) = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet's check this formula with the layers we computed:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it gives the same result as computing each layer step by step. That's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's denote the innermost expression as S. So, S = 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*S, where S is the previous layer.\n\nBut as we saw earlier, this is a recurrence relation, which leads to the same formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0.\n\nWait, 13 is 9 + 3 + 1, which is 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nBut 40 is 27 + 9 + 3 + 1, which is 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, which is 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0.\n\nWait a minute, I see a pattern here. Each layer n seems to be the sum of 3^0 up to 3^n.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nLayer 1: 3^1 + 3^0 = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0 = 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 121.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer n is equal to the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k.\n\nBut the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to k=n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/ (3 - 1) ) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the formula we derived earlier.\n\nTherefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, solve the recurrence relation, or recognize the pattern as a geometric series, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, I'll verify a few key steps again.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let's compute this again. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's 88572. Yes, correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you have 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a sum of powers of 3 up to a certain point, as I did earlier, which also confirms the result.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add step by step: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.

So 88572. Hmm, but I think I made a mistake because when I compute 29524 * 3, I can compute it as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any errors in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It looks like each layer is following a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let me see if I can find A and B. Wait, but for n=0, if we consider L_0, it would be 1, since it's the base case before any layers. But in our case, L_1 is 4. Alternatively, maybe we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. So L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but let me just verify one or two layers again to be sure. Let's check Layer 5: L_5 should be 364. Let's compute it using the formula: L_5 = (3^{6} - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. And Layer 7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. So everything seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to check for any errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find the closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, n = 9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the steps I took, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

So, I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Let me recall the formula. Wait, actually, the standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + d. The solution is a_n = (a_1 + d/(r-1))*(r)^{n-1} - d/(r-1). Let me apply this here. Here, r = 3, d = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1) = (a_1 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Now, a_1 is 4. So, a_n = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me compute a_9 using this formula. a_9 = (9/2) * 3^{8} - 1/2. 3^8 is 6561. So, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2. Compute (9/2)*6561: 9*6561 = 59049, then divided by 2: 59049/2 = 29524.5. Then subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, a_9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote the innermost term as x. So, starting from the inside: x = 1 + 3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3x. Then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3x) = 1 + 3 + 9x. Continuing this way, each layer adds another power of 3. So, perhaps each layer is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, when you have a nested expression like this, it can be represented as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to see. Let me consider the expression E = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Then, E = 1 + 3*E', where E' is the same expression with n-1 layers. But in our case, the number of layers is fixed, so maybe it's better to model it as a recurrence relation, which I did earlier. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I can find a closed-form expression for a_n, which is what I did. So, with that, I'm confident that the value is 88572. Just to double-check, maybe I can compute a few layers again. Let's recompute Layers 1 through 3: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that all adds up. So, I think I've solved it correctly. The key was to recognize the pattern and compute each layer step by step, ensuring that each computation was accurate. I also verified using a recurrence relation formula, which gave me the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could recognize that this expression is a geometric series or something similar, but given the way it's structured, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence. Maybe there's a formula for that. Let me think. If I have a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me solve it properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check if this formula works for the layers we computed. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it directly, without using the formula, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which grows exponentially. But since I already did the step-by-step computation and verified with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the innermost expression evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, writing it all together: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that would be 88572. Let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so units digit 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, carryover 0. Next digit:5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, the result is 88572. So, putting it all together, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, then 1+3*40=121, then 1+3*121=364, then 1+3*364=1093, then 1+3*1093=3280, then 1+3*3280=9841, then 1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with so many layers. Let me think about whether this sequence follows a known pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few terms to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 times a_9, so 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is building up to a geometric series. The recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1 can be seen as a way to sum a geometric series. Each term is 3 times the previous, plus 1, which can be expanded as 3*(3*(3*(... +1)...)). But I think the formula approach is more straightforward here.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because that would throw off the entire calculation.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer step by step again, maybe using a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if this forms a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n, where n goes from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 88572. Hmm, so that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L_n. Let's see, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that works. We know that L_1 = 4. Let's plug in n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Similarly, for n=2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4, and 9A + B = 13. Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1)/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify that: L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers: For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me try to model it. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, let's find another equation by considering the homogeneous solution and particular solution. Alternatively, we can solve it iteratively. Let's compute a few terms to see if we can find a pattern. L_1 = 4 = 3*1 + 1\nL_2 = 13 = 3*4 + 1 = 12 + 1\nL_3 = 40 = 3*13 + 1 = 39 + 1\nL_4 = 121 = 3*40 + 1 = 120 + 1\nL_5 = 364 = 3*121 + 1 = 363 + 1\nL_6 = 1093 = 3*364 + 1 = 1092 + 1\nL_7 = 3280 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3279 + 1\nL_8 = 9841 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9840 + 1\nL_9 = 29524 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29523 + 1\n\nLooking at these, I notice that each L_n is one more than a multiple of 3. Let me see if I can express L_n as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. That matches L_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. That matches L_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So it seems that L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express the entire expression as a function of the number of layers. Since there are 9 layers, each adding a 3*(...), perhaps the expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Which is exactly what we have. So, 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is finite (9 layers), it might be more straightforward to compute each step as I did before. However, for practice, let me try to find a closed-form formula. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check if this formula holds for the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but it's always good to verify. Another way to check is to compute a smaller version of the problem and see if the formula holds. Let's say, for example, if we have just one layer: 3*(1+3)=3*4=12. Using the formula, n=1, 3*(a_1)=3*4=12. Correct. For two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))=3*(1 + 3*4)=3*(1 + 12)=3*13=39. Using the formula, a_2=13, so 3*a_2=39. Correct. Similarly, for three layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))=3*(1 + 3*4)=3*(1 + 12)=3*13=39. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, for three layers, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let's compute it step by step: Innermost: 1 + 3=4. Middle: 1 + 3*4=13. Outer: 3*13=39. So, yes, 39. Using the formula, a_3=40, but wait, no, because the formula is for each a_n being the inner expression, not including the outermost 3. Wait, in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(...), so the formula gives a_n for each layer, and then we multiply by 3 at the end. So for three layers, the innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=13, then a_3=40, and the total expression is 3*a_3=120. Wait, but when I computed it step by step, I got 39. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me clarify. The formula gives a_n for each layer, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for the entire expression, which is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result after 9 layers. So, in the case of three layers, the expression would be 3*a_3, where a_3=40. But when I computed it step by step, I only had three layers, which gave me 39, not 120. Wait, that suggests an inconsistency. Let me check again. If I have three layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Compute innermost: 1 + 3=4. Middle: 1 + 3*4=13. Outer: 1 + 3*13=40. Then, the entire expression is 3*40=120. Wait, but earlier, when I thought I had three layers, I computed 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) as 39, but that's incorrect. Let me recast that. Let me parse it correctly. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, innermost is (1 + 3)=4. Then, middle is (1 + 3*4)=13. Then, outer is (1 + 3*13)=40. Then, the entire expression is 3*40=120. So, my initial step-by-step computation was wrong because I thought it was 39, but actually, it's 120. So, the formula works correctly. Therefore, my earlier concern was misplaced because I misapplied the step-by-step computation. So, the formula holds, and the iterative method also gives the correct result when done properly. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer to the original problem is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As I computed earlier, 29524 * 3 = 88572. To be absolutely sure, let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yep, that matches. So, I think I did it correctly.

Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe this is a geometric series or follows a recurrence relation. Let's think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested structure and compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\( a_n \\) is \\( \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the outermost layer \\( a_9 \\), this gives \\( \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 =29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2= 3*29524=88572. Yep, same result.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or recognize a pattern. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing that each layer is a term in a sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but I feel like that's a big number. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step. Because computing each layer manually is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers. Maybe there's a recursive formula or something. Let me think about the structure of the problem. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall the formula for such a recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r is the coefficient and c is a constant. In this case, r=3 and c=1. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + (c/(r-1)), where A is a constant determined by the initial condition. Let me verify that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^n. The particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = r*K + c => K - r*K = c => K(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, so r=3, c=1. So the particular solution is K = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, what is the initial condition? The innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So when n=1, a_1=4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth layer is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. Let me just recap: The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing the recurrence relation, I found a formula that allows me to compute the value of each layer directly, which saved a lot of time and reduced the chance of arithmetic errors. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or have a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since our problem has 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to express the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me think. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is similar, so perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for the entire thing. But since we've already computed it step by step and verified it with the recurrence relation, I think 88,572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, quickly. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the computed value is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{another term})\\).

    "text": " Write down 8. So putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I did 9 * 3, I got 27 + 1 = 28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Then 2 * 3 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8. So yes, 88572. Let me verify with another method: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + a(a + a(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented by a geometric series or have a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's say each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try to find A and B. We know that L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, L_9 = 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. I think that's solid.

Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer checks out. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9, which is then multiplied by 3. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which could be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is linear and has constant coefficients, so maybe I can solve it using standard techniques. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence is given by L_n = C*a^n + (b)/(a - 1), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me verify that. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*a^n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since b is a constant, we can assume L_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the known values:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I found before. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me see: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression. That's pretty cool. It saves a lot of time, especially if there were more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step wasn't too bad. But it's good to know that there's a formula in case the number of layers increases. Let me just recap what I did:\n\n1. Recognized the nested structure and the repeating pattern.\n2. Started computing from the innermost layer, moving outward.\n3. Noticing the recurrence relation, I derived a closed-form solution to avoid computing each layer manually.\n4. Verified the formula with known values to ensure its correctness.\n5. Applied the formula to find the value of the outermost layer.\n6. Multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n7. Cross-checked the result using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis methodical approach helps prevent mistakes, especially with repetitive calculations. It's easy to miscount or miscalculate when dealing with multiple layers, so having a formula to rely on is a good check. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

    "text": " So the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...\" is a layer. So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of layers. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3: that's the first innermost. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" before the innermost. Let me write it out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, my initial computation was correct with 9 layers, ending up with 29524, then multiplying by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. Maybe the innermost is Layer 1, then each subsequent is another layer. So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the expression:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left: 3(1+3(...). Each time after a 3, there's a (1+3(...). Let me count the number of times this happens. Starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3(...), which is Layer 1. Then inside that is another 1 + 3(...), which is Layer 2, and so on until the innermost 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3( inside the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3)))\n\nWait, so from the first 3, there are 8 more \"1+3(\" before the innermost 1+3. Wait, that might mean that there are 9 layers in total. Wait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me see: The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost 3, the innermost is the last 1 + 3. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have 8 opening parentheses before the innermost 1 + 3. So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1, then each preceding is Layer 2 up to Layer 9. Wait, so maybe I have 9 layers, each time starting from the innermost. So, that would mean that my earlier computation of 9 layers is correct, leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, let me try computing a few more layers using the formula to see if it holds. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 =728/2=364. Which matches. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^10 -1)/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by recognizing the repeating pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression as a geometric series. Let's see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I let the innermost part be x, then each layer is 1 + 3x, but since it's infinitely nested, but in our case, it's finite with 9 layers. Wait, but maybe using the formula I found earlier, since it's a finite nesting, it's better to stick with the step-by-step approach or the recurrence relation. Either way, both methods give me the same result. So, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me just confirm once more by computing 3*29524. Let me compute 29524*3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88,572. Therefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, but wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" sections. 1: 3(1+3(...\n2: ...1+3(...\n3: ...1+3(...\n4: ...1+3(...\n5: ...1+3(...\n6: ...1+3(...\n7: ...1+3(...\n8: ...1+3(...\n9: ...1+3(...\n10: ...1+3))))) Wait, actually, perhaps I miscounted. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent \"1+3(\" is a new layer.

So, I think I counted correctly from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each being one more layer inside. So, that should be correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can approach this problem in a different way, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous step). That's similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me consider that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as we computed earlier. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the expression inside the initial 3 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, (59049 - 1)/2 is indeed 29524. Therefore, everything checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3 times the entire expression. So, I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions to see if there's a quicker way. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a relation can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula directly, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10}=59049, so 59049 -1=59048. Then, 59048/2=29524, and 3*29524=88572.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't miss a layer. Let me count the number of layers again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). Let's count how many 1 + 3(...) there are. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1 + 3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each 1 + 3(...) adds a layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, inside the first 3(...), there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Wait, actually, starting from the first 3, the expression inside is 1 + 3(...), which itself contains another 1 + 3(...), and so on, 8 more times, making a total of 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, and Layer 9 is the outermost 1 + 3(...), which is then multiplied by the initial 3. So, yes, 9 layers, each computed correctly. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. This expression resembles a geometric series or something that can be modeled recursively. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 result I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula, I still get the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I can think of each layer as a geometric progression. Each time, the term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer, and there are 9 layers, and then multiplied by 3. But I think the recurrence approach is solid here. So, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. In this case, a = 3, and b = 1. Wait, no, actually, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, comparing to the standard form, a = 3, b = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, we have L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I were to compute each layer without using the formula, I would still get the same result, as I did earlier. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, I'll compute one more layer using the formula. Let's say Layer 4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Which is exactly what I got earlier. So, the formula works. Therefore, using the formula is a more efficient way, especially if the number of layers increases. But since we have only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable, though time-consuming. In any case, both methods lead to the same result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern. Using the formula for such a recurrence relation, we determine that the 9th layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: After the first 3, the first ( is Layer 1: 1+3(...). Then each subsequent ( is another layer. Let's count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each ( adds a layer. Let me count the number of ( after the first 3: 1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3: Each ( adds a layer. So, from the initial 3, the first ( starts Layer 1, then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of ( in the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of ( after the 3: 1. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n2.

(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe a better way is to count the number of times 1+3 appears. Each time, it's followed by another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then, moving out, each ( adds another layer. So, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3. Then, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, perhaps? Because in the original expression, I think there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Wait, let me count the number of ( after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there are 8 opening parentheses: each ( adds a layer. Wait, let me count them:\n\nAfter 3(, there's 1. Then, each subsequent ( adds another layer. So, in the expression, after the initial 3(, how many ( are there? Let me write it out:\n\n3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3\n))))\n\nSo, each ( adds a layer, and the number of ( after the initial 3 is 8. Therefore, the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost 1+3 up to the 9th layer, which is the outermost one. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I had Layer 1 as 1+3, Layer 2 as 1+3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9, which I computed as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. But just to be sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's a bit different because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me think about it. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have n=9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's consistent with my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation.

Wait, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a recursive formula. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9. So, if I can compute a_9, then multiply by 3, I get the answer. Let's compute a_1 through a_9 using this recursive formula. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, as before, a_9 is 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572. So, this method confirms the previous result. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and it's of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute this without expanding each layer, I could use the closed-form formula. Since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form solution, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, we need to compute a_9, and then multiply by 3. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, a_9 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, it's a bit more involved. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let's consider the general form. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. To solve this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer without manually computing each layer. That's reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern where each term is (3^{n} -1)/2, but in this case, since we're dealing with nine layers, it's more efficient to use the formula. But since I had to compute each layer step by step initially, that worked too. It's good to cross-verify using different methods to ensure the answer is correct. Another way to think about this is to recognize that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. However, the +1 complicates things a bit, but as we saw, the recurrence relation approach works well here. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. 3. After computing Layer 9, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. 4. Cross-verify using a recurrence relation formula to ensure the result is accurate. 5. Confirm that both methods yield the same result, 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the computed value is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, each layer is following the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, but since n is small (only 9 layers), computing each step is manageable.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute each step once more:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. The recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard methods. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1), we can solve for C:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check that for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, that's Layer 1.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13.

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, yes, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, is there a formula for such a geometric series? Let me think: Each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is: L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process continues up to Layer 9, which equals 29,524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524 = 79048 + 9524. 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.

The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of times we have \"1+3(...)\" inside. Starting from the innermost: Each time we have \"1+3(...)\", so how many times does this happen? Let me count the opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers: Each time we have a new layer, it's a new \"1+3(...)\". Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, after the first 3, we have (1+3(...)), and inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count: The first layer after the initial 3 is the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer is another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: Each time we have \"1+3(\", so let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, the first \"1+3(\" is at the innermost, then each time we go out, another \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of closing parentheses. Let me see: The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of closing parentheses: Starting from the end, each time we have a closing parenthesis. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), so that's one closing parenthesis.\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just count the number of layers. Let me try to parse the expression:\n\nThe expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... and so on, until the innermost is 1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that each time we have a new \"1+3(\", starting from the innermost, so the number of layers is 9. Because the expression starts with 3(1+3(...)), and inside that, there are 8 more layers, making a total of 9 layers. Wait, no, let me think again. Let me parse the expression:\n\n- The outermost is 3*(...), where ... is (1 + 3*(...))\n- Inside that, it's (1 + 3*(...)), and so on.\n\nEach time we have a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen each time we wrap around with another (1 + 3*(...)), so layer 2, layer 3, etc., until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there?

Alternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each time you go in, you have another layer, and the innermost is 1+3, so there are 9 layers in total. Wait, let me think: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, the number of layers is the number of times you have \"1 + 3*(...)\", starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses in the expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"(\": After the initial 3, each \"(\" is a new layer.\n\nSo:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses, but each one is part of a \"1+3(\" expression. So, that would mean 9 layers, right? So, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3, then layer 2 is 1+3*(layer1), up to layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers, leading to layer9 being 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I count the opening parentheses after the initial 3, I see 9 of them, each corresponding to a new layer. So, that would mean 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my computation of each layer from 1 to 9, as I did before, is correct. Therefore, I think my final answer is correct: 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again, step by step, to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in the computations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the arithmetic checks out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me recompute each layer step by step.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Wait, but let me check Layer 8 again because when I did Layer 8, I had 3*3280, which is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. That's correct. Then Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: As we did before, 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which in this case is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since this is nonhomogeneous, we can also compute it iteratively. Alternatively, we can notice that each term is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. Let's try to compute a few terms to see if we can find a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, this is a geometric-like sequence, but with an additive constant. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_0 + c/(1 - r)) * r^n - c/(1 - r). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_0 - c/(1 - r)) * r^n + c/(1 - r), provided that r \u2260 1. In this case, r = 3 and c = 1. So, let's apply that formula. Let me check: a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} + c/(1 - r). Wait, maybe it's better to derive it. Let's consider the recurrence: a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = 3a_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value we got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as before. So, this confirms that the result is correct. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3 * a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it using the closed-form formula. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the closed-form formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation step by step again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that this expression is a form of a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is feasible. But just for fun, maybe I can find a closed-form formula to compute a_n without iterating each step. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative approach and the closed-form formula give the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So, all the layers are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. It seems like each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, maybe there's a formula for such a geometric series or something. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote the value of the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed. Then, each subsequent layer is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with the values we computed earlier to see if it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value at Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1 = 59048 / 2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.
