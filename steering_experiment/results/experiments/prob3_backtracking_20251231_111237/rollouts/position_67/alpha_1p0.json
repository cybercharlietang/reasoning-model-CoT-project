    "text": " Wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so when multiplying by 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7, write 7, carry 0. 5 *3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9 *3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2 *3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 40000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4 + same. Wait, maybe a better way: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 =60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 =87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is larger. But since there are only nine layers, computing each one step by step is manageable. But just to explore, maybe there's a recursive formula or a geometric series here. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find D. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So the closed-form expression is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this, we derive a closed-form formula and compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(inner expression)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\).\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because each layer seems to be growing quite rapidly, and I want to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me double-check a couple of the layers.\n\nLet me check Layer 5 again: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Then, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the original expression is 3*(...), and the innermost part is 1+3, which is 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from 4, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but is there a formula for such a sequence? It looks like each term is defined by a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, a_n^(p) = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each layer as a geometric series. Each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be expanded as a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this way, after n layers, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0, where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3, so maybe a_0 would be 1? Let me see.\n\nActually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nIf I expand a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_0). Wait, but a_1 is 1 + 3*a_0, so if a_1 = 4, then 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. So, the initial term is a_0 = 1.\n\nThen, the expansion for a_n would be a geometric series:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n * a_0.\n\nSince a_0 = 1, a_n = sum_{k=0}^n 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWhich is exactly the formula we derived earlier. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nThis further confirms that the answer is correct. So, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n\nBut just to make absolutely sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again:\n\nStart with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, multiply by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent every time I compute it. I think I've got it right.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then tripling the previous amount, which is characteristic of a geometric progression with ratio 3. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S_n = a*(r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In our case, the first term a is 1, r is 3, and the number of terms is 10 (since we have 9 layers plus the initial 1). Wait, no, actually, the number of layers is 9, but the exponents go up to 3^9, so the sum would be S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is exactly what we got for a_9. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nThis method also aligns with the earlier computations, so I'm even more confident now that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've considered multiple approaches: expanding step by step, using recurrence relations, and applying the formula for a geometric series. All methods lead to the same result, so I can't see any mistakes in the reasoning. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression. By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Outermost layer: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Hmm, I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are growing so quickly. Let me check if there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. That recurrence relation might have a closed-form solution. Let me think about solving it. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct, and the formula also leads me to the same result. So, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.

Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me double-check each step to ensure accuracy. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2; carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, 5; carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, 8; carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or solved using a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I also get 88572. That's reassuring. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. So, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) and so on. This would lead to a sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} multiplied by some factor. Wait, let's see: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. If we expand it, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}. So, the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^{n-1}. The sum S = (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, but earlier I had a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Let me think: If a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is indeed 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. So, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but when n=1, sum is 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1. When n=2, sum is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is a_2. So, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm it. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Now, adding all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1 for n >= 2, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^(2))/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, Layer 9 would be L9 = (3^(10))/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works too. Let's think about expanding the entire expression. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this, each term inside is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Specifically, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, each subsequent term adds another 3* that previous term. So, perhaps this can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see: Let's denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me try to see how many 3s are being multiplied. Since there are nine layers, each time we have a 3 multiplied by the next layer. So, expanding E, we get: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) ) Let's try to expand this step by step, but maybe it's too time-consuming. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, and we've already found that the nth layer is (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2, so for n=9, it's (3^10)/2 - 1/2, as before. So, E = 3*L9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that's consistent with the earlier computation. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from L1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. If I write out the first few terms, I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied. Alternatively, since each term is 1 + 3*previous, we can write this as a recurrence relation, which we've already done. So, using the formula we derived, it's straightforward to compute L9 and then multiply by 3. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing them. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 =1 +3=4. Then, a_{n} =1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. We can solve this recurrence relation. The solution to such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K =1 +3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))) step by step, using the formula. Since each a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me think again. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer manually. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as each layer, then:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. I notice that each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This looks like a geometric sequence or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln.\n\nThe recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^(n) + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but let me think. The homogeneous solution is when we set the recurrence to Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous part, which is the constant term 1.\n\nAssume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p = K. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\nWhen n=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L9 = (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nWait, because n=9 would correspond to Layer 9, which is the innermost expression. Wait, no, actually, in the problem, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, L9 would be (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L9 = (3^10 -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (3^11 -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, 29524 is actually 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's add digit by digit. 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. 0 + 5 = 5, write 5, carry 0. 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write 8. 2 + 0 = 2. So, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Okay, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back through each layer to verify. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, then each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right-hand side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Rearranging: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. Great, so the formula holds. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression, which is 3*a_9. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, using the formula, I can directly compute it as (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572. That's a much quicker way. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and finding the general formula for each layer, I can compute the result more efficiently. But either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step or apply a formula to find the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\n2. **Recurrence relation**: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\n3. **General formula**: Using the recurrence relation, we find that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the outermost layer**: For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7, write 7, carry 0. 5 *3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 *3: Let me compute it another way to verify. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9000 = 58524, 58524 + 500 = 59024, 59024 + 24 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. So yes, 29524 *3 = 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a lot of computation. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, because n=9 corresponds to the 9th layer, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3. Let me confirm: If Layer 1 is a_1, then Layer 9 is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier calculation. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we also get 88572. Therefore, the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute it directly without calculating each layer step by step, which would have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But for 9 layers, step-by-step wasn't too bad. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final answer is 88572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1 as 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. But I want to make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me check again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each next layer adds another 1+3*(...). How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first parenthesis after 3 is 1+3(...), and each subsequent one adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: Starting from the first 3, the first ( is 1+3(...). Then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the first ( after 3, each ( adds another layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(...)) The innermost is 1+3, so each layer is added with another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers because each ( adds a layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let me count the number of (:\n\n1. After 3: (1+3(\n2. Then another ( inside: (1+3(\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times 1+3 appears nested. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, that's 1.\n- Then it's wrapped by another 1+3( that one), so that's 2.\n- Each time we go outward, we add another layer. So, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each time we go out, we add a layer. Let's count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. Layer 1: 1+3\n2. Layer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n3. Layer3:1+3(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer9:1+3(Layer8)\n\nBecause each time we add a new (, we add a new layer, and there are 9 sets of ( starting from the first one after 3.\n\nWait, no. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let's count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. First ( after 3: Layer1 starts here.\n2. Then another ( inside that: Layer2 starts here.\n3. And so on until the 9th (.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to count the number of times we have 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, that's Layer1.\n- Then moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...), so Layer2, Layer3, up to Layer9.\n\nYes, so there are 9 layers in total. So, I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again, just to be sure. It's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic when dealing with large numbers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step multiplies the previous layer by 3 and adds 1. So, Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1).\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer9 again. Layer8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again to be absolutely sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers, let me count the number of opening parentheses again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let's count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. After 3: (\n2. Inside that: (\n3. Inside that: (\n4. Inside that: (\n5. Inside that: (\n6. Inside that: (\n7. Inside that: (\n8. Inside that: (\n9. Inside that: (\n10. Inside that: )\n\nWait, that can't be right because I think I miscounted. Let me write it out:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3\n)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 9, each corresponding to a layer. So, Layer1 is the innermost 1+3, and Layer9 is the outermost. So, my calculation of 9 layers is correct.\n\nTherefore, the computation is accurate, and the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I computed Layer9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88572. But let me check if the original expression is 3*(Layer9). Yes, because the entire expression is 3*(...), and inside that is Layer9. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nThus, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can confirm that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be solved as I did, leading to the same result.\n\nSo, to sum up, the problem required computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, we arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find the value of each layer and ultimately multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost layer.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems correct? Let me check: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Let me verify using another method. 29524 * 3: Break it down as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3=87000. 524*3=1572. Now, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me cross-verify my earlier steps because I think I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation again, just to be sure.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*(29524) = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. So the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute each layer step by step again, maybe using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So starting from n1=1+3=4, n2=1+3*4=13, n3=1+3*13=40, and so on. So each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous term). This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term. Let's denote a_k as the value of the k-th layer. So:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_k. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution comes from a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When k=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor k=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nk=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nk=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nk=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nk=5:\n\na_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nk=6:\n\na_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nk=7:\n\na_7 = (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nk=8:\n\na_8 = (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nk=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Correct.\n\nSo both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake when dealing with so many layers. Let me go back through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula to compute it without manually calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, maybe it's faster to compute them step by step. Alternatively, perhaps this is a form of a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it using the recurrence approach. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, the initial condition is a_1 = 4, but perhaps the general formula can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's another way to get the same result. So, that confirms the answer. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Evaluating up to the ninth layer gives us 29524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer is correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which might be similar to a geometric series or something else. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. Then, the final result is 3*L9. So, this is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let me try to find a pattern. Let me compute the first few layers again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nI wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent Ln. Let's see:\n\nLooking at L1 = 4 = (3^2) - 5? Hmm, 3^2=9, 9-5=4. Not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's see if each term can be expressed as (something with powers of 3). Let me see:\n\nL1 = 4 = (3^1) + 1. Because 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nWait, L2 = 13. Let's see: 3^2 + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13. Hmm, that works.\n\nL3 = 40. 3^3 + 13 = 27 + 13 = 40. Yes.\n\nL4 = 121. 3^4 + 40 = 81 + 40 = 121.\n\nL5 = 364. 3^5 + 121 = 243 + 121 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1093. 3^6 + 364 = 729 + 364 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 3280. 3^7 + 1093 = 2187 + 1093 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 9841. 3^8 + 3280 = 6561 + 3280 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 29524. 3^9 + 9841 = 19683 + 9841 = 29524.\n\nAh! So, there's a pattern here. Each Ln = 3^n + Ln-2? Wait, not exactly. Wait, looking at the terms:\n\nL1 = 3^1 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, L1 is 4, which is 3 + 1. Then L2 is 13, which is 9 + 4. Hmm, maybe it's 3^n + L_{n-1}?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nL1 = 4 = 3^1 + 1.\n\nL2 = 13 = 3^2 + 4 = 9 + 4.\n\nL3 = 40 = 3^3 + 13 = 27 + 13.\n\nL4 = 121 = 3^4 + 40 = 81 + 40.\n\nSo, in general, Ln = 3^n + Ln-2? Wait, no, because L3 = 3^3 + L2, which is 27 + 13 = 40, yes.\n\nWait, but L2 = 3^2 + L1 = 9 + 4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L3 = 3^3 + L2 = 27 + 13 = 40.\n\nSo, it seems that Ln = 3^n + Ln-1, but that can't be because if L1 = 4, then L2 would be 3^2 + L1 = 9 + 4 = 13, which is correct. Then L3 = 3^3 + L2 = 27 + 13 = 40, correct. So, in general, Ln = 3^n + Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nWait, but let's check if that holds for all terms.\n\nL4 = 3^4 + L3 = 81 + 40 = 121, correct.\n\nL5 = 3^5 + L4 = 243 + 121 = 364, correct.\n\nYes, so the general formula is Ln = 3^n + Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nBut that seems a bit recursive, but maybe we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nAlternatively, since each term is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, starting from L1 = 4.\n\nWait, that's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Lp = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches L1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches L2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches L9=29524.\n\nPerfect! So, the closed-form formula is Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which we already computed.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as we found earlier.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*L9. So, using the closed-form formula, we can compute L9 directly without computing each layer, which would be more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut in this case, since n=9, it's manageable either way. But it's good to know that the formula exists.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to express the entire expression in terms of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me try to see if the entire expression can be written as a geometric series.\n\nEach time, we have a term that's 1 + 3*(...), so if we expand it all out, it might form a geometric series.\n\nLet me try to expand the entire expression step by step.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me write it as E = 3*(1 + 3*E1), where E1 is the next layer.\n\nBut perhaps expanding it all the way would show a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the entire expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with nine layers.\n\nBut maybe it's better to think recursively.\n\nWait, but since we already have the closed-form for L9, and we've verified it, and the final answer is 3*L9 = 88572, perhaps that's the simplest way.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try to compute the expression step by step, layer by layer, again, to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3, maybe I can express it as a sum.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nEach time we have a 1, and then a 3 times another expression. So, expanding it all the way, the expression would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nExpanding step by step:\n\nLet me start from the innermost and work outward, but perhaps in a different way.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nA = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer:\n\nB = 1 + 3*A = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer:\n\nC = 1 + 3*B = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext:\n\nD = 1 + 3*C = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nE = 1 + 3*D = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nF = 1 + 3*E = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nG = 1 + 3*F = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nH = 1 + 3*G = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nI = 1 + 3*H = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*I = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a base-3 number or something, but I don't think that's necessary here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is building up a number that's one more than three times the previous layer. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This kind of recursive relation often leads to numbers that are one less than a power of 3, but in this case, it's a bit different because we're adding 1 each time.\n\nWait, but from the closed-form formula we derived earlier, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which for n=9 gives us (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is exactly L9.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. I've checked it multiple times, both by step-by-step computation and by deriving a closed-form formula, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nTo solve this, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as $1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}$. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.\n\nHere's the step-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. Layer 2: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n3. Layer 3: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n4. Layer 4: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n5. Layer 5: $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364$\n6.

Layer 9: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, writing it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have been faster or reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on, up to a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without having to manually compute each layer, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.

    "text": " So, putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each time, it's 1 + 3*previous layer. If I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, we have a recursive formula here. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Substitute the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n = 1, L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the closed-form formula. Let's see: The original expression is 3*(L_9), where L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, after computing each layer step by step and then verifying with a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined by 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed and used in the next. Using a recursive formula, the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the result is 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do this step-by-step, I might make an error. Let me verify each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, but wait, let me check 3*29524 again using another method to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which can be solved if it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The solution would be a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + r^n*(a_0 - c/(1 - r)). Wait, but let me check. The standard solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + r^n*(a_0 - c/(1 - r))). In this case, r = 3, c = 1, so a_n = (1/(1 - 3)) + 3^n*(a_0 - 1/(1 - 3))). Simplifying, 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, a_n = -1/2 + 3^n*(a_0 + 1/2). But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. Let me see if this formula applies. Wait, maybe I'm getting the indices wrong. Let's see. If I consider a_1 as the first term, which is 4, then the general solution would be a_n = (1/(1 - 3)) + 3^{n}*(a_0 - 1/(1 - 3))). But a_0 is undefined here because our first term is a_1. Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. So, with a_0 = 1, the solution would be a_n = (1/(1 - 3)) + 3^{n}*(a_0 - 1/(1 - 3))). So, plugging in, a_n = (1/(-2)) + 3^n*(1 - (1/(-2))) = (-1/2) + 3^n*(1 + 1/2) = (-1/2) + 3^n*(3/2) = (3^{n} * 3)/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me compute that again. Starting from a_n = (1/(1 - 3)) + 3^{n}*(a_0 - 1/(1 - 3)) = (1/-2) + 3^{n}*(1 - (1/-2)) = (-1/2) + 3^{n}*(1 + 1/2) = (-1/2) + 3^{n}*(3/2) = (3^{n} * 3)/2 - 1/2. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me compute it step by step. So, a_n = c/(1 - r) + r^{n}*(a_0 - c/(1 - r)). Here, c = 1, r = 3, so a_n = 1/(1 - 3) + 3^{n}*(a_0 - 1/(1 - 3)) = 1/(-2) + 3^{n}*(a_0 - (1/(-2))) = (-1/2) + 3^{n}*(a_0 + 1/2). Now, since a_0 = 1, plug that in: a_n = (-1/2) + 3^{n}*(1 + 1/2) = (-1/2) + 3^{n}*(3/2) = (3^{n} * 3)/2 - 1/2. Wait, that's the same as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as a_1 is 4. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as we computed earlier. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct again. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value we computed step by step earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to see this without computing each layer. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've found that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula directly, I end up with the same answer, 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a pattern where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}$. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation $a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$ with $a_1 = 4$.

Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. But wait, let me go back through my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that all adds up. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see: Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Looking at these numbers, I can see that each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, it's a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so perhaps I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence pattern, we can determine that each layer follows a specific formula.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently, recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and this repeats multiple times, perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since the innermost layer is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, then layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. Just to recap, the approach was to recognize the nested structure, compute each layer step by step from the inside out, and then verify using a recurrence relation formula.

I computed each layer up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. I think that's correct. Let me verify with a smaller version of the problem to see if the method works. For example, if I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1))). Let's compute that using my method. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.

    "text": " Wait, the number is 29524, so the digits are 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).

So 3 * 29524 = 88572. Let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carry 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer because I might have made a mistake in the earlier computations. Let's go through each layer step by step again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me confirm this result. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait a minute, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which in this case is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = C*3^{n} + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let me try to find the particular solution. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant, D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but our layers are integers. Maybe the homogeneous solution will adjust for that. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n = C*3^{n}. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent with my earlier computation. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression using the formula. Since each layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost layer is (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute it step by step again, in case I missed any step. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 =13. Then, 1 + 3*13=40. Then, 1 + 3*40=121. Then, 1 + 3*121=364. Then, 1 + 3*364=1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093=3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280=9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

    "text": " Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 2 is in the ten thousands place. So, 2 * 3 = 6, plus any carryover? Wait, when I multiplied the thousands place (9), I had a carryover of 2, so 2 * 3 + 2 = 8. So, the digits are: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units).

Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7     3  \n--------  \n88572\n\nYes, that seems right because 30000 * 3 = 90000, and 29524 is 476 less than 30000. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Hmm, that checks out. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.

Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that all adds up.

Yes, that's correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer manually. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general form for such a recurrence is L_n = a*r^{n} + b. Let's try to find constants a and b such that L_n = a*r^{n} + b. Plugging into the recurrence: a*r^{n} + b = 1 + 3*(a*r^{n-1} + b). Simplifying: a*r^{n} + b = 1 + 3*a*r^{n-1} + 3*b. Let's divide both sides by r^{n-1}: a*r + (b)/r^{n-1} = (1)/r^{n-1} + 3*a + 3*b/(r^{n-1}). Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe a better approach is to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*A - 1/2 => 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirmed the result. That was a bit more efficient, especially if the number of layers was larger. But for nine layers, manually computing each step wasn't too bad. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Let me just write down the steps again concisely: 1. Compute innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). 3. After computing up to the 9th layer, get 29524. 4. Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 88572.

So, this is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works. So, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 *29524 =88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and finding the closed-form formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, maybe I can compute one more layer using the formula to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet's compute Layer 5 using the formula: (3^{6} -1)/2 =729 -1=728/2=364. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, revealing a pattern that can be expressed using a recursive formula. By solving the recurrence relation, we find a closed-form expression for each layer, which simplifies the computation. Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 yields the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Wait, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when I multiply by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, the computation of each layer seems accurate. Therefore, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but I just thought of something. When I computed Layer 9, I did 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Let me try an alternative approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Wait a minute, these numbers look familiar. 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, these seem to be following a pattern similar to powers of 3, but not exactly. Let me check: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe each L_n can be expressed as (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct. So, yes, it seems that L_n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^(10) -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that's another way to verify it. Alternatively, since each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging in the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be written as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4 + 0.5 =4.5 => A=4.5/3=1.5=3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches what I found earlier. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. So, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step by step computation, recognizing the pattern and using the formula, and even solving the recurrence relation. All methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. I started from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. As I did earlier, it's 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. The expression seems to be of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series perhaps? Let me see. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let's check: 29524 *3: 29524 * 3: 29,524 *3: Let me compute 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.

So, the final answer would be 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check for any errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.

That seems correct. Wait, but I just realized that in the original problem, the expression is 3*(...), so when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's the innermost part, and then each layer up to the outermost one would be multiplied by 3 again? Wait no, no, because each layer is already 1 +3*(previous layer). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's the entire expression inside the first set of parentheses, right? So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524=88,572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me think again: The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 +3*(...). So, starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then, 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, and so on, up to Layer 9: 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88,572. So, that's the final answer. Wait, but I feel like that's a big number, 88,572. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or a formula. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}. Let me find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D =1 +3*D => D -3D=1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Alternatively, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10}=59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 and having 9 terms. Wait, but actually, the expression is 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))). So, it's like 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*...))). So, if we let S be the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses, then S=1 +3*S', where S' is the next layer. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Wait, but in this case, it's a finite geometric series because there are 9 layers. Let me see: The expression inside the outermost parentheses is S=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))). Let me count how many terms there are. Each time we go a layer in, we add another term. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's 1 term. Then each layer adds another term. So, with 9 layers, the expression inside the outermost parentheses would be a sum of 9 terms, each multiplied by 3 raised to the appropriate power. Wait, but maybe it's better to think of it as S=1 +3*S', where S' is the next layer. But since we've already computed it using the recurrence relation, perhaps that's the more straightforward method. Either way, the result is consistent: 88,572. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step. \n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, 29524 is actually a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).

So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. This kind of recursive structure can sometimes be represented using a formula. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, defined as f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence relation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1, with f(1) = 4. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 0, which has the solution f_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form f_p(n) = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n = 9. Therefore, f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9.\n\nSo, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1 for n >=2, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Ln.\n\nThe recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients, but since it's non-homogeneous (because of the constant term 1), I might need to find a particular solution and the homogeneous solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence as:\n\nLn - 3*Ln-1 = 1\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = Ln^h + Ln^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but given the nesting, it might be correct. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 being 29524. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations or the reasoning. The formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a formula. The nth layer is given by a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer follows a geometric progression or some recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.

Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 29524. Each time, I'm multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So, yes, that seems correct. So, 3 times 29524 is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This is similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote the nth layer as L_n, where L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find B. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Now, let's find another equation. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 13 = 9A + B. Now, we have two equations: 4 = 3A + B and 13 = 9A + B. Let's subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as we got earlier. So, L_9=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms our earlier result. Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem. For example, recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see. The expression inside is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, if we have k layers, the expression would be (3^{k+1} -1)/2, as we saw earlier. So, with 9 layers, it's (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the formula for a geometric series. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.

Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that this structure is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let's count again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9, which is the innermost for the outermost 3. Wait, actually, in the original expression, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1), etc., up to Layer 9, which is the innermost for the outermost 3. But in the expression, after Layer9, we have 3*(Layer9). So, the total number of layers is 9, but the expression is 3*(Layer9). Therefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, but since it's only 9 layers, computing step by step was manageable. However, using the recurrence relation formula is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only 9, step-by-step computation was feasible. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting with Layer1: 1 + 3 =4. Layer2: 1 +3*4=13. Layer3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1 +3*40=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Each step seems correct, so I'm confident in the result. Therefore, the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Then, 3 * 29524 = 87572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L9. Then, the total expression is 3*L9. So, maybe I can find a general formula for Ln in terms of n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is Ln^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume Ln^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So, when n=1, L1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but since each term is built upon the previous one, the recurrence approach worked well. So, I think I've got the right answer here. To recap, I broke down the expression layer by layer, computed each one step by step, then used a general formula to confirm the result, and finally multiplied by 3 to get the final answer. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me recompute 3*29524: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that could be generalized. Let me think about whether there's a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for n=0, if we consider L_0, it would be 1, since 1 + 3*(L_{-1})... Wait, actually, the base case is L_1=4. Let me try to find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition at n=1: L_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9: L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. The original expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*59048/2=3*29524=88572. So, same result. Therefore, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've thoroughly checked each step, both by computing each layer manually and by finding a general formula for the layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something like that. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, then each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, from a_1 to a_9, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation.

Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression. That might have saved time instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, I could recognize the pattern as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1 each time. But in any case, both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step. Each layer follows the pattern:\n\n$a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}$\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. Layer 2: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n3. Layer 3: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n4. Layer 4: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n5. Layer 5: $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364$\n6. Layer 6: $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093$\n7. Layer 7: $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280$\n8. Layer 8: $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841$\n9. Layer 9: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"
