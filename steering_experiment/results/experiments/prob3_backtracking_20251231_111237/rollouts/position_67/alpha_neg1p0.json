    "text": " Write down 8. So, putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2; carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, 7; carryover 0. 5*3=15, 5; carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, 8; carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me compute 29524 * 3 another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000. 9000 * 3 = 27000. 500 * 3 = 1500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now add them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I think that's correct.

Wait, but let me double-check each step because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's assume that as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate unless A=0, but since each a_n is finite, perhaps B is the steady-state value. Wait, but maybe I can solve it more carefully. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result.

So the result is 88572? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute it step by step: 29524 * 3. 4 * 3 = 12. So units place is 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So tens place is 7, carryover 0. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. So hundreds place is 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. So thousands place is 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So ten-thousands place is 8.

Wait, but let me verify this by another method to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, did I compute all the layers correctly? Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. I can solve this to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to recognize the pattern. Alternatively, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 * something. Wait, let me think. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). In this case, k = 3, c = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = (4 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (9/2)*3^2 - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let's compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2. Let's compute (9/2)*6561: 9*6561 = 59049. Then, 59049/2 = 29524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and solving the recurrence relation. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Then, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I correctly computed each layer step by step. Let me go through each layer again to check for any possible mistakes. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3*(...), and each time, it's multiplied by 3. So, each layer can be represented recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's thorough enough. I considered both the step-by-step approach and the recursive formula approach, verified each step, and arrived at the same answer both ways. So, I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer's value and then multiply the outermost layer by 3. Using a recursive formula, we find that the nth term follows the pattern a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this for n=9, we find a_9 = 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, writing it all together, we get 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, but given that it's only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Alternatively, this expression resembles a geometric series, perhaps? Let me think about that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, we have a recurrence relation here: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = D, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without calculating each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, both methods work. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, to find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the initial layers to see if it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start without computing each layer, which would have been more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, computing each step is manageable. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014the iterative step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula\u2014lead to the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost layer equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a nested series where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute each layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because if I made a mistake in any of the layers, the final answer will be off. Let's go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to make sure it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form solution. Each layer n is given by a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It's similar to a geometric series but with a different structure. Let's consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct, matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, a_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's consistent with what I found earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=87572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Each a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))). So, when expanded, each a_n is 1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^{n}. Wait, but that's a geometric series with ratio 3. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to m is (3^{m+1} -1)/2, which is similar to what we found earlier. Wait, but in our case, a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, which, when expanded, gives a_n=1 +3 +3^2 +...+3^{n}. So, for a_9, it would be the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -1)/(3-1)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, as before. Therefore, 3*a_9=3*29524=87572. So, that's another way to see it. So, regardless of the method, the answer comes out to be 87572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layers compute to 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, and finally 29524 for the outermost layer. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{87572}$"

Wait, that would be 87,572? Wait, 29524 * 3 is 88,572? Wait, no, let me compute it another way. 29524 * 3: 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. But 29524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go back and check each step again. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1,093 as 1093, which is correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 1,093 * 3: 1,000 * 3 = 3,000; 93 * 3 = 279. So, 3,000 + 279 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3,280 * 3: 3,000 * 3 = 9,000; 280 * 3 = 840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 9,841 * 3: 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 800 * 3 = 2,400; 40 * 3 = 120; 1 * 3 = 3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, but wait a minute, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, which is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. But let me just verify the multiplication again because sometimes when I do it quickly, I might make an error. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 another way. Breaking it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented recursively as:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, L(1) was 4, L(2) was 13, etc. So, perhaps this is a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me try to find a general formula for L(n).\n\nThe recurrence relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nThen, the particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nAssume L_p = C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check if this formula works with the values we have.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, using the formula, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is L(9), it's (3^10 -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524, which matches what we computed earlier.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with 88,572 as the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula approach, let me go through the steps again.\n\nWe have L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4.\n\nWe solved the recurrence and found L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nThen, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(L(9)), and L(n) = (3^(n+1)-1)/2, then 3*L(9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\n3^11 is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144. Divided by 2 is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3 and adds 1. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nThis seems like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an added 1 each time. So, perhaps the sum can be expressed as a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a bit different. It's more like a recursive sequence.\n\nBut using the formula we found, it's easier to compute without having to do each layer manually.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with the formula, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using a derived formula, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this until the outermost layer is reached. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Write down 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, carry over 1. 9 + 9 + 1 = 19, carry over 1. 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. So that's 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add digit by digit: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. 0 + 5 = 5, write 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. 5 + 2 + 1 = 8, write 8. So, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. So, yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Sometimes when you do a lot of steps, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go back through each layer step by step to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is computed as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for each layer, we're computing a new term based on the previous one. So, with a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the formula for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is when we set the nonhomogeneous term (the +1) to zero: a_n = 3*a_{n-1}. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Wait, let me check that: 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, using the formula, we can directly compute it as (3^{11} -3)/2=88572. That's a much quicker way, but since I initially didn't recognize the pattern, I had to compute each layer step by step. It's good to verify using both methods to ensure that the answer is correct. So, in summary, by computing each nested layer from the inside out, I arrived at the result 88572, and then I confirmed it using the formula for the linear recurrence relation, which also gave me 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression.

Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that's a lot of steps and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the layers. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to error, especially with nine layers. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me recall that for a geometric series, the sum S = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^(n-1). But in this case, it's a bit different because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, perhaps it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n. Since we have nine layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, and the total expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11} =3*3^{10}=3*59049=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, or use the recurrence relation and the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything: 1. Recognized the nested structure and decided to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Computed each layer step by step, verifying each computation. 3. Noticed a pattern that could be modeled as a recurrence relation. 4. Solved the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula. 5. Verified the formula with known values from the step-by-step computation. 6. Applied the formula to find the value of the innermost expression, then multiplied by 3 for the final answer. 7. Cross-checked using an alternative approach with the closed-form formula to ensure consistency. All steps led to the same result, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression.

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121.

Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems to check out. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The solution can be found by iterating the recurrence. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: L1=4 L2=1+3*4=13 L3=1+3*13=40 L4=1+3*40=121 L5=1+3*121=364 L6=1+3*364=1093 L7=1+3*1093=3280 L8=1+3*3280=9841 L9=1+3*9841=29524 As before. So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. This is a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but with an added constant each time. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. We have L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^(h) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^(p) = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4 +0.5=4.5 => A=4.5/3=1.5=3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L9)=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result.

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression from the inside out using another approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, it's similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2.\n\nSo, the sequence would be: a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524, as I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works.

So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, but let me check: when n=1, a_1=4. Plugging into the formula: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. Similarly, n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Now, 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form $1 + 3 \\times$ (previous term).

So yes, 87572. So, the final answer would be 87572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 87572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use here, rather than computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about whether there's a formula for such a nested expression. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Next, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the known values to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, we can write it as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Wait, that's different from 87572. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake here? Wait, no, let me check again. Wait, the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. But 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. But when I computed it step by step, I got 87572. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, when I computed layer 9 as a_9 = 29524, then 3*29524 = 87572. But according to the formula, it's (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 3^{11} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Yes, that's correct. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. But when I computed step by step, I got 87572. That suggests that I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation. Let me go back to the step-by-step computation and see where I went wrong. Let me recompute each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 87572. Wait, but according to the formula, it's 88572. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 3*29524 again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit. 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. Wait, that's correct. But according to the formula, it's 88572. So, there's a contradiction here. That suggests that the formula might be incorrect, or perhaps I misapplied it. Wait, let me check the formula again. The general solution for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's correct. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, the formula for the entire expression is 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Wait, but that's different from 87572. So, which one is correct? There's a mistake here. Let me think about it. Wait, perhaps the formula is for a_n, which is the value inside the parentheses at each layer. But the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. But when I compute it step by step, I get 87572, which is equal to (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Wait, but 87572 is not equal to 88572. There's a discrepancy of 1000. That suggests that I made a mistake in either the step-by-step computation or in the formula application. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original problem again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+...). So, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...): Starting from the first 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3. Then each layer wraps around it. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+...). The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers? Let me see: The expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)) inside the outermost 3(...). So, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 layers of 1+3*(...). So, that would mean that a_9 is the innermost layer, and the outermost is 3*a_9. So, according to the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11}-3)/2 = 88572. But when I computed it step by step, I got 87572. There's a problem here. Let me check the step-by-step computation again. Maybe I made an error in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 87572. So, step-by-step, it's 87572, but according to the formula, it's 88572. There's a difference of 1000. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the formula is for a different indexing. Maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me check the formula again. The formula was derived as a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the layer number. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 87572. But according to the formula, the entire expression is (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 3^{11} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. But when I compute it step by step, I get 87572. There's a difference of 1000. That suggests that either the formula is incorrect, or the step-by-step computation is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, and I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+...). The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 1+3, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so the outermost is 3*(1+3(...)), and inside that, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3, then layer 2: 1+3*(layer1), up to layer9: 1+3*(layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, according to the formula, layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 87572. But according to the formula for the entire expression, it's (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572. There's a discrepancy. So, which one is correct? Let me compute both and see which one matches the step-by-step computation. Wait, in the step-by-step, I got 87572, which is 3*29524. According to the formula, it should be (3^{11}-3)/2 = 88572. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the formula must be wrong, or perhaps I misapplied it. Wait, let me think again about the formula. The general solution was a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 87572. But the formula for the entire expression being (3^{11} -3)/2 is derived from 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. So, that should be correct. But when I compute it step by step, I get 87572, which is equal to (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572? Wait, no, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. But 3*29524 is 87572, which is different. So, there's a contradiction. That suggests that either the formula is incorrect, or the step-by-step computation is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside the outermost 3(...). Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Therefore, the innermost is layer1: 1+3, and the outermost is layer9: 1+3*(layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, 3*29524 = 87572. But according to the formula, 3*layer9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5 *3=15, write5, carry1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28, write8, carry2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8.\n\nSo, 87572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the formula must have an error. Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I misapplied it. Let me think again. The formula was a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which gives layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*layer9 = 87572. But according to the formula, 3*layer9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572. But 3*layer9 is 87572, not 88572. Therefore, the formula is not matching the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in deriving the formula. Let me go back to the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. Let me try to solve this recurrence again. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 1, let's assume a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the equation: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, that's correct. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 87572. But according to the formula, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572. Wait, but 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. So, that's correct. But when I compute 3*29524, I get 87572, which is not equal to (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572. Therefore, there's a miscalculation here. Wait, let me compute 3^{11} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. But 3*29524 is 87572. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 29524 *3 again: 29524 *3. Let's do it as 29524 *3:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the formula must be wrong, but the formula was derived correctly. Wait, no, the formula is correct. Let me compute (3^{11} -3)/2:\n\n3^{11}=177147.\n\n177147 -3=177144.\n\n177144 /2=88572.\n\nBut 3*29524=87572.\n\nSo, 87572 \u2260 88572.\n\nTherefore, there's a contradiction. That suggests that the formula is incorrect, but the step-by-step computation is correct. Therefore, the formula must have been misapplied.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for a different indexing. Let me check the indexing. The formula was derived with a_1=4, which corresponds to the innermost layer. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. So, for n=9, a_9=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=87572. Therefore, the formula for the entire expression is 3*a_9=87572. But according to the formula, 3*a_9= (3^{11} -3)/2=88572. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 3^{11} again: 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. But 3*29524=87572. Therefore, the formula must be incorrect, but the step-by-step is correct. Therefore, the formula is not applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=87572. Therefore, the entire expression is 87572, which is correct. Therefore, the formula for the entire expression is 3*a_9=87572. Therefore, the formula (3^{11} -3)/2=88572 is incorrect. Wait, but that formula is derived from 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. So, that should be correct. But in reality, when I compute it, it's 87572. Therefore, there's a mistake in the formula. Wait, but the formula was derived correctly. Let me check the initial condition again. The initial condition was a_1=4. So, a_1=4. Using the formula, a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct. a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula is correct. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Therefore, 3*a_9=87572. Therefore, the entire expression is 87572. Therefore, the formula (3^{11}-3)/2=88572 must be incorrect in this context. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but I misapplied it. Let me think differently. Maybe the entire expression is 3*(a_9), which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572. But when I compute step by step, I get 87572. Therefore, which one is correct? Let me compute 3^{11} again: 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. But 3*29524=87572. Therefore, there's a discrepancy of 1000. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the step-by-step computation. Let me check the step-by-step computation again. Let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*29524=87572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the formula must be wrong. But the formula was derived correctly, so perhaps the formula is correct, but I misapplied it. Wait, perhaps the formula is for the expression without the outermost 3. Let me think. The formula gives a_n as the value inside the parentheses at each layer. So, the entire expression is 3*a_n. Therefore, for n=9, it's 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572. But in reality, when I compute it step by step, I get 87572. Therefore, there's a problem. Let me check if 3^{11}=177147. Yes. So, (177147 -3)/2=88572. But 3*29524=87572. Therefore, the difference is 1000. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation. Let me check layer9 again. Layer9: 1 +3*layer8. Layer8 is 9841. So, 3*9841=29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. Correct. So, layer9=29524. Then, 3*29524=87572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the formula must be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but the indexing is off. Let me think. If I consider that the outermost expression is 3*(layer9), then the formula for the entire expression is 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572. But in reality, it"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer's computation because that's a lot of layers and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see if there's a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form a_p = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, for layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree, so I'm confident the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

But in the problem, the expression is 3*(...), so maybe Layer 9 is actually the innermost. Wait, no, that can't be. Let me recount the layers in the original problem.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3\n\nThen each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count how many times 1+3 is nested.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because each time we add another 1+3(...). So, in total, there are 9 layers. So my initial approach was correct: Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost, which is inside the first 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in my calculation, Layer 9 was 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. But I'm a bit unsure because the numbers seem to be growing very quickly. Let me check each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that.\n\nSuppose each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, we can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nBut since L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), we can solve it as follows:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_p(n) = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm using the formula. Since each Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I did it correctly. The numbers are growing exponentially, which makes sense because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time, leading to a rapid increase. So, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using the formula for the nth layer, we determine that the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about whether there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, so the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can express a_n in terms of a_1. The homogeneous solution is based on the recurrence a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct, matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, matches a_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers because if I messed up any of the layers, the final answer will be wrong. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Did I compute Layer 9 correctly? Because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify each layer once more. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Let's denote the innermost expression as a1, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on up to a9, and the final result is 3*a9. So, in general, each term is defined as a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1=1+3=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1=4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation formula, I also get the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. But since each term is built upon the previous one, it's more of a nested multiplication. But the formula we derived earlier using the recurrence relation seems solid, and it gives the correct result when tested with the step-by-step computation. So, I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1 is 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is 59049, so a9=(59049 - 1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that all adds up. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a recurrence pattern.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n is defined recursively. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to confirm. For example, n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Which is correct. n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is correct. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine the value of the innermost layer and work our way out. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\).

The closed-form solution is \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n = 9\\), \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\n4. **Compute the Final Result**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Hmm, I think I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit calculation. Let me try that again. 29524 * 3: Starting from the rightmost digit: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.

Wait, that would be 88752? But when I did the other method, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check again. 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.

Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method to verify. 29524 + 29524 = 59048; then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. So that's correct. So where did I go wrong in the digit-by-digit multiplication? Let me check again: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo writing it as 8 (from the 2*3 + 2), then 8 (from 9*3 +1), 7 (from 5*3), 5 (from 2*3 +1), 2 (from 4*3). Wait, but the digits should be in the same order. Let me write it properly:\n\nThe number is 29524.\n\nMultiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- 4 (units place) *3 =12 \u2192 units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n\n- 2 (tens place) *3=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens digit is7, carryover 0.\n\n-5 (hundreds place)*3=15 \u2192 hundreds digit is5, carryover1.\n\n-9 (thousands place)*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands digit is8, carryover2.\n\n-2 (ten-thousands place)*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten-thousands digit is8.\n\nSo writing the digits from left to right: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88752, but that's not matching with the sum method which gave 88572. There's a mistake here. Wait, let me check the place values again.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the digits. Let me write the number 29524 as:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo when multiplying each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n\n4 *3=12 \u2192 units:2, carryover1.\n\n2 (tens) *3=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens:7, carryover0.\n\n5 (hundreds)*3=15 \u2192 hundreds:5, carryover1.\n\n9 (thousands)*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands:8, carryover2.\n\n2 (ten thousands)*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten thousands:8.\n\nSo the result is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). So that's 88752. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. There's a conflict here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's check 29524 *3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nLet's add them:\n\n59048\n+29524\n=?\n\nAdding units: 8 +4=12 \u2192 2, carryover1.\n\n4 +2=6 +1=7 \u21927.\n\n0 +5=5.\n\n9 +9=18 \u21928, carryover1.\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8.\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo that's correct. So why did the digit-by-digit multiplication give me 88752? I must have made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits when writing them down. Let me try the digit-by-digit again carefully.\n\nNumber: 2 9 5 2 4\n\nMultiplying each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right (units place):\n\n4 *3=12 \u2192 units digit:2, carryover1.\n\nNext digit (tens place):2 *3=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens digit:7, carryover0.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place):5 *3=15 \u2192 hundreds digit:5, carryover1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place):9 *3=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands digit:8, carryover2.\n\nNext digit (ten thousands place):2 *3=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten thousands digit:8.\n\nSo writing the digits together: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88572. Oh! I see where I messed up earlier. I had written the hundreds digit as 7, but it's actually 5 from the hundreds place. So the correct result is 88572. That matches the sum method. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back to the layers. Did I compute each layer correctly? Let me double-check each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 =1 +12=13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo yes, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 *3=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 29524 *3 again.\n\n29524 *3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000 *3=27000\n\n500 *3=1500\n\n20 *3=60\n\n4 *3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a geometric sequence.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 =1 +3=4, a_2=1 +3a_1, etc.\n\nSo, a_n =1 +3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 3a_{n-1} +1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n -3a_{n-1}=0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C =3C +1 \u2192 C -3C=1 \u2192 -2C=1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 =3A -1/2 \u2192 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, I also get 88572 as the answer. That gives me more confidence that this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series multiplied by 3. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*...))). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, expanding it, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)))).\n\nIf I let S be the entire expression inside the first 3*(...), then S=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*...)).\n\nBut wait, that's the same as S=1 +3S.\n\nWait, that can't be right because S is the entire expression, but in our problem, we have a finite number of layers, not an infinite one. So, perhaps this approach is only valid for an infinite series. Let me check.\n\nWait, but in our problem, there are 9 layers, so it's a finite expression. So, the approach of using the recurrence relation is more appropriate here.\n\nIn any case, since I've computed each layer step by step and verified using the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Layer 1:4\n\n- Layer 2:13\n\n- Layer 3:40\n\n- Layer 4:121\n\n- Layer 5:364\n\n- Layer 6:1093\n\n- Layer 7:3280\n\n- Layer 8:9841\n\n- Layer 9:29524\n\nMultiply by 3:88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work. I don't see any mistakes now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute it differently. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So yes, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572. So the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364. Let's compute 3\u00d7364: 3\u00d7300=900, 3\u00d760=180, 3\u00d74=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093. Let's compute 3\u00d71000=3000, 3\u00d790=270, 3\u00d73=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280. Let's compute 3\u00d73000=9000, 3\u00d7200=600, 3\u00d780=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841. Let's compute 3\u00d79000=27000, 3\u00d7800=2400, 3\u00d740=120, 3\u00d71=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3\u00d729524 = 88,572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Wait, but in our problem, the expression is 3*(a_9), because the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. Wait, let me check: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is 3*(a_9). Wait, no. Let me think. Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, the outermost layer is a_9, which is 1 + 3*a_8. Then, the entire expression is 3*(a_9). So, to compute the entire expression, it's 3*(a_9). Using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*( (59049 -1)/2 ) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the final result is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations because I double-checked each layer and also derived a formula to confirm the result. So, I'm pretty sure that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Using this relation, we derive a closed-form formula and compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Write down 8. So, putting it together: 87572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 87572. So the final result is 87,572. Let me just verify my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=87572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B =1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 to a_9, so the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that. First, compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, 3^{10}=59049. Then, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572? Wait, earlier I got 87572, but using this formula, I get 88572. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Which one is correct? Let me check my earlier step-by-step calculation. When I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then 3*29524=87572. But using the formula, it's 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )=3*(59048/2)=3*29524=88572. Wait, so which one is correct? There must be an error in my step-by-step calculation. Let me retrace. Starting with Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer2:1 +3*4=13. Layer3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1 +3*40=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=87572. But according to the formula, it's 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )=3*(59048/2)=3*29524=88572. Wait, that's a contradiction. So, where did I go wrong? Let me check the step-by-step layers again. Layer1:1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Wait, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572? Wait, no, 29524*3: 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the correct way. Let me do it properly: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 87572. So, step-by-step, it's 87572, but the formula gives 88572. There's a discrepancy here. So, which one is correct? Let me check the formula again. The formula was a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. But my step-by-step gives 87572. There's a difference of 1000. So, where did I go wrong? Let me check my step-by-step again. Maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count them: 1. 1+3(...) 2. 1+3(...) 3. 1+3(...) 4. 1+3(...) 5. 1+3(...) 6. 1+3(...) 7. 1+3(...) 8. 1+3(...) 9. 1+3(...) So, there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(...). So, a_1 to a_9. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9. But according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, so 3*a_9=88572. But my step-by-step gave me 87572. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step. Let me check each layer again. Layer1:1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1+3*4=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 87572. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated 29524*3. Let me compute 29524*3 again. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation where I thought it was 87572. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 87572. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. So, the step-by-step was correct, and my initial multiplication was wrong. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, it's 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )=3*(59048/2)=3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, the result is 88572? Wait, no, let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the number is 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify my earlier steps because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1+3(...).\n\nLooking at the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent 3( is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...) parts. Starting from the first 3(1+3(..., I think there are nine layers because each time it's 1+3(...), and the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer is one more. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think I did it right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(r - 1))*(r^n - 1) + (a_0 - c/(r - 1))*r^n\n\nWait, actually, the standard solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = r^n * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nIn our case, a_0 is the initial term, which would be when n=0, but in our problem, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, which corresponds to n=1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index starting from n=0.\n\nWait, let me adjust.\n\nIf we consider a_0 = 1 (the innermost term before any multiplication), then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's take n=0: a_0 = 1\n\nSo,\n\n1 = A*3^0 + (-1/2)\n\n1 = A*1 - 1/2\n\nSo, A = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the value we got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I used two methods: step-by-step computation and finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations. Both led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
