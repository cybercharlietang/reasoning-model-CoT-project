Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms it. Alternatively, if I didn't realize the recurrence, I could have noticed that each step is 1 + 3*previous, and just computed each layer as I did before. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014direct computation and solving the recurrence\u2014lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, we find Layer 9 to be 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"
