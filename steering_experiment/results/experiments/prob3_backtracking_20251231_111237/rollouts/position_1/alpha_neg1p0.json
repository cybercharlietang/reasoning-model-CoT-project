It seems like each step involves multiplying by 3 and then adding 1, and this pattern repeats multiple times. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and working outward. So, maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part and then work my way outwards. That makes sense because parentheses dictate the order of operations, so innermost ones should be done first.\n\nLet me write down the expression again, but maybe number the parentheses to make it easier to track:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n2. Then, moving outward, each subsequent expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression plus 1.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, each term is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each step involves a multiplication by 3 after adding 1 to the result of the inner expression.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1? Wait, no, looking back, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Let me make sure.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the structure:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3). Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost). Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and so on, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of each step as evaluating from the inside out, each time computing the value of each parenthesis and substituting it into the next level.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving outward, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, but looking back, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Let me confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look at the structure again.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) )\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which suggests that each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So perhaps I should compute starting from the innermost and work outward, each time computing 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, that might be the case. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because in the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(...), so perhaps I need to adjust my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the layers. Let me try a different approach. Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that each 3(1 + ... ) is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...), so each time I have a new layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps that with 3*(1 + ...), so let's see how many layers there are.\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of times 1 + 3(...) occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, moving outward, it's 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\nWait, no, perhaps each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so perhaps each step is 3*(1 + previous result). Let me see.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(inner result)).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the order. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nLet me think of the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, but that would be if it were 3*(1 + 4), but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps it's 3*(1 + 3*(previous result)).\n\nWait, that might be correct. Let me try that.\n\nSo, innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, but that seems like a big jump. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, you take the inner result, multiply by 3, add 1, then multiply by 3 again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me try that.\n\nSo, innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, but according to the original structure, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would be 3*(1 + 3*(inner result)).\n\nWait, so perhaps I was wrong before. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me take the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(13) = 39.\n\nWait, but in the original structure, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps I should compute it as 3*(1 + 3*(previous result)).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression correctly. Let me write it out step by step.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous result)).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the original expression, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds one more 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n10. 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot of layers. Let me check the original expression again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3(1 + ... parts, I think there are 9 layers, each time with 3*(1 + ...). So perhaps I went too far in my previous count.\n\nWait, let me recount. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, let's do that.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression seems to have 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, after 9 layers, the result would be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this because I'm not sure if I'm counting correctly. Let me write down the expression again:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each time, we have 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9, as each 3*(1 + ... is a layer.\n\nSo, after computing each layer, we get:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 15\n\nLayer 3: 48\n\nLayer 4: 147\n\nLayer 5: 444\n\nLayer 6: 1335\n\nLayer 7: 4008\n\nLayer 8: 12027\n\nLayer 9: 36084\n\nSo, the final result would be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a different approach. Perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + b*...)) can sometimes be expressed using a formula, especially if they're repeated multiple times. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous result). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as 3*(1 + previous term).\n\nLet me denote the nth term as a_n, where a_1 = 4 (from the innermost (1 + 3)).\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, after 9 layers, the result is 36084.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if there's a formula for this kind of nested multiplication. Let me think.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series, but each term is being multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let me try to model this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, let's find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 3 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 3\n\n-2*a_p = 3\n\na_p = -3/2\n\nBut this doesn't make sense in our context because all our a_n terms are positive. So perhaps this approach isn't suitable, or maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the recurrence in terms of a telescoping product.\n\nLet me try expanding the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each a_n is 3 times (1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nLet me try to express a_n in terms of a_1.\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*1 + 3*a_2 = 3*1 + 3*(3*1 + 3*a_1) = 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3^2*a_1\n\nContinuing this pattern, I can see that:\n\na_n = 3^{n-1}*a_1 + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n-2} + ... + 3^1\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me try to find a pattern.\n\nWait, let me compute a_n for n=1 to 9 and see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nn | a_n\n1 | 4\n2 | 15\n3 | 48\n4 | 147\n5 | 444\n6 | 1335\n7 | 4008\n8 | 12027\n9 | 36084\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each a_n is 3 times the previous a_{n-1} plus 3.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express a_n as 3^n times some factor plus a constant.\n\nWait, let's try to solve the recurrence relation properly.\n\nGiven a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me write this as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 3 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 3\n\n-2*a_p = 3\n\na_p = -3/2\n\nHmm, that's a negative fraction, which doesn't make sense in the context of our problem because all our a_n terms are positive. So perhaps this approach isn't suitable, or maybe I need to adjust my method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the solution using the method of solving linear recurrences.\n\nThe general solution is:\n\na_n = homogeneous solution + particular solution\n\nWhich is:\n\na_n = C*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3C\n\nWhich is 11/2 = 3C\n\nThus, C = (11/2) / 3 = 11/6\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can factor out 3^n:\n\na_n = 3^n*(11/6) - 3/2\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15, which matches.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48, which matches.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147, which matches.\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (11*243 - 9)/6 = (2673 - 9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444, which matches.\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (11*729 - 9)/6 = (8019 - 9)/6 = 8010/6 = 1335, which matches.\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (11*2187 - 9)/6 = (24057 - 9)/6 = 24048/6 = 4008, which matches.\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (11*6561 - 9)/6 = (72171 - 9)/6 = 72162/6 = 12027, which matches.\n\nn=9:\n\na_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216513 - 9)/6 = 216504/6 = 36084, which matches.\n\nSo, the formula seems to work correctly. Therefore, the value after 9 layers is 36084.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I considered that each layer is 3*(1 + previous result), but the formula I derived seems to fit perfectly with the computed values.\n\nSo, according to this, after 9 layers, the result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm correctly accounting for the number of layers. The original expression has 9 instances of 3*(1 + ...), so n=9 in the formula.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me just compute it step by step again to be sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\na_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nFor n=9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\n3^9 is 19683\n\nSo, 11*19683 = 216,513\n\n216,513 - 9 = 216,504\n\n216,504 / 6 = 36,084\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 36,084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( (1 + 3) = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147 \\)\n5. Layer 5: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444 \\)\n6. Layer 6: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335 \\)\n7. Layer 7: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008 \\)\n8. Layer 8: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027 \\)\n9. Layer 9: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084 \\)\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

It looks like a chain of operations starting from the innermost part and working outwards. So, maybe I should start from the inside and work my way out, simplifying each layer one by one. That sounds like a good plan.\n\nLet me write this down step by step to keep track. I'll start from the innermost parentheses and move outward.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define the innermost expression first. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nOkay, so now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). Let me compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, that's 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 2). Let me compute that.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, 40. Let me go another layer out.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nOkay, 121. Moving on.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nThat's 364. Next layer.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWhoa, 1093. That's a big number. Let me keep going.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3280. Moving on.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWow, that's 9841. Another layer.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n29524. Now, the outermost layer.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost expression: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Because the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost part all the way up, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, yes, if the innermost part simplifies to 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nBut let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, seems consistent each time. Let me verify each multiplication to be sure.\n\nStarting with step 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nStep 2: 3*4 = 12; 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nStep 3: 3*13 = 39; 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nStep 4: 3*40 = 120; 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nStep 5: 3*121 = 363; 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: 3*364 = 1092; 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 3*1093 = 3279; 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 3*3280 = 9840; 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 3*9841 = 29523; 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nStep 10: 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nOkay, each step seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each step manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me analyze the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, say a_n, where n is the number of layers, then each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with the innermost term a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recursions.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by:\n\na_n = (c / (1 - r)) + (a_1 * r^{n-1})\n\nWait, let me check that formula. I think it's:\n\nFor a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is:\n\na_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nBut in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's similar but starts with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nLet me define the recurrence as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, the general solution for such a non-homogeneous linear recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's see how many layers we have in the original problem.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...)\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of closing parentheses before the outermost 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of times 1+3 is nested.\n\nLet me see: the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps another 1+3 around it. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nIn the original problem, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of 1+3( inside.\n\nStarting from the first 1+3 after the initial 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that, 1+3(1+3(...))\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(...)))\n...\nContinuing until the innermost.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time we have a 1+3( before a new layer. Let me see how many 1+3( there are before the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 1+3, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3( in the expression.\n\nEach time I see a 1+3(, that's a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(1+3(\n3. 1+3(1+3(\n4. 1+3(1+3(\n5. 1+3(1+3(\n6. 1+3(1+3(\n7. 1+3(1+3(\n8. 1+3(1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, but after the initial 3(, the first 1+3( is the start of the first layer. Then each subsequent 1+3( adds another layer. Let me count the number of 1+3( after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the initial 3(, the number of 1+3( is 9. Because each time you see 1+3(, that's a new layer, and there are 9 of them before the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, let me count:\n\n- After the first 3(, the next is 1+3(\n- Then another 1+3(\n- And so on, until the innermost.\n\nLet me see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the initial 3(, the first 1+3( is layer 1, then each subsequent 1+3( adds another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me see: the innermost is 1+3), so starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 1+3( before it. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 1+3( after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested. Each time you have a 1+3(...), that's a new layer.\n\nIn the original expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps another 1+3 around it. So, how many times does 1+3 get wrapped?\n\nLooking at the expression, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3( before it. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times you see 1+3( before the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n- After the initial 3(, we have:\n  - 1+3(\n  - 1+3(\n  - 1+3(\n  - 1+3(\n  - 1+3(\n  - 1+3(\n  - 1+3(\n  - 1+3(\n  - 1+3(\n  \nSo, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3(, each corresponding to a new layer. Therefore, the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step computation, I went through 9 layers, starting from the innermost as layer 1, up to layer 9, which gave me a result of 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut according to the formula I derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers.\n\nSo, if n = 9, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nYes, that's exactly the same as the result I got from step-by-step computation. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression after 9 layers is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula, the total expression is 3*a_n, where a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, total expression = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nGiven that n = 9, total expression = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, total expression = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula derived from the linear recurrence, I get the same answer: 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify 3^11 again.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. Both methods give me the same result, and I've double-checked the calculations.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nAnswer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

It looks like a nested expression where each level has a similar structure. Let me try to parse it from the inside out because that's usually the way to handle nested parentheses.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, the expression is 1+3. So let me write that down:\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). So substituting the innermost result, it becomes:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, let me compute that step by step. First, compute the multiplication: 3*4 = 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo now, moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So substituting 13 in, we have:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*13\n\nAgain, compute multiplication first: 3*13 = 39. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each level seems to be 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me see if this pattern continues.\n\nContinuing, the next level would be:\n\n1 + 3*40\n\nCompute 3*40 first: 120. Then add 1: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, that's a square number, 11\u00b2. Interesting, but maybe it's a coincidence. Let me keep going.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121: 363. Then add 1: 364.\n\nHmm, 364. Not sure if that's significant. Let's proceed.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: 1092. Then add 1: 1093.\n\nWait, 1093. That's a prime number, isn't it? Not sure if that matters, but just noting.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: 3279. Then add 1: 3280.\n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280 = 9840. Then add 1: 9841.\n\nWait, 9841. Hmm, is that a square number? Let me check: 99\u00b2 is 9801, and 100\u00b2 is 10000, so 9841 is between them. Let me see, 99\u00b2 = 9801, 99*99=9801, 99*99=9801, so 9841 - 9801 = 40, so no, it's not a perfect square. Maybe not relevant.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: 29523. Then add 1: 29524.\n\nWait, 29524. Let me see, is that a square? Let's see, 172\u00b2 is 29584, which is higher, and 171\u00b2 is 29241. So no, not a perfect square.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*29524\n\nCompute 3*29524: 88572. Then add 1: 88573.\n\nHmm, 88573. Not sure if that's significant. Let's keep going.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*88573\n\nCompute 3*88573: 265719. Then add 1: 265720.\n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*265720\n\n3*265720 = 797160. Then add 1: 797161.\n\nWait, 797161. Let me check if that's a square. 893\u00b2 is 797449, which is higher, so 893\u00b2 is 797449, so 797161 is less. Let me check 893\u00b2: 893*893. 800\u00b2 is 640000, 90\u00b2 is 8100, 3\u00b2 is 9. Wait, maybe I should compute 893\u00b2 properly.\n\nCompute 893\u00b2:\n\n(800 + 93)\u00b2 = 800\u00b2 + 2*800*93 + 93\u00b2\n\n= 640000 + 2*800*93 + 8649\n\nCompute 2*800*93: 1600*93 = 148800\n\nCompute 93\u00b2: 8649\n\nSo total: 640000 + 148800 = 788800; 788800 + 8649 = 797449.\n\nSo 893\u00b2 = 797449. Therefore, 797161 is less than that. Let me check 892\u00b2.\n\n892\u00b2 = (890 + 2)\u00b2 = 890\u00b2 + 2*890*2 + 2\u00b2\n\n890\u00b2: 792100\n\n2*890*2 = 3560\n\n2\u00b2 = 4\n\nSo 792100 + 3560 = 795660 + 4 = 795664.\n\nSo 892\u00b2 = 795664, and 893\u00b2 = 797449. So 797161 is between them. Not a perfect square, so maybe not relevant.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*797161\n\nCompute 3*797161: 2391483. Then add 1: 2391484.\n\nWait, 2391484. Let me check if that's a square. Let's see, 1500\u00b2 is 2,250,000. 1600\u00b2 is 2,560,000. So 1550\u00b2 is 2,402,500. Hmm, 1550\u00b2 is 2,402,500, which is higher than 2,391,484. Let me check 1540\u00b2.\n\n1540\u00b2: 1500\u00b2 + 2*1500*40 + 40\u00b2 = 2,250,000 + 120,000 + 1,600 = 2,371,600.\n\nSo 1540\u00b2 = 2,371,600.\n\nThen 1545\u00b2: Let's compute 1545\u00b2.\n\n1545\u00b2: (1500 + 45)\u00b2 = 1500\u00b2 + 2*1500*45 + 45\u00b2\n\n= 2,250,000 + 135,000 + 2,025\n\n= 2,250,000 + 135,000 = 2,385,000 + 2,025 = 2,387,025.\n\nStill less than 2,391,484.\n\nNext, 1550\u00b2 is 2,402,500 as before.\n\nSo 2,391,484 is between 1545\u00b2 and 1550\u00b2. Let me compute 1546\u00b2.\n\n1546\u00b2: 1540\u00b2 + 2*1540*6 + 6\u00b2 = 2,371,600 + 18,480 + 36 = 2,371,600 + 18,480 = 2,390,080 + 36 = 2,390,116.\n\nStill less than 2,391,484.\n\n1547\u00b2: 1546\u00b2 + 2*1546 +1 = 2,390,116 + 3,092 + 1 = 2,393,209.\n\nWait, that's higher than 2,391,484. So 1547\u00b2 is 2,393,209, which is higher. So 2,391,484 is between 1546\u00b2 and 1547\u00b2, so it's not a perfect square.\n\nSo maybe this number isn't a square, but perhaps it's a cube or something else. Maybe it's not important, but just noting.\n\nNow, moving back to the problem. So far, I've computed each level step by step from the inside out, and I've reached the outermost expression, which is 1 + 3*2391484. Wait, no, actually, I think I might have miscounted the levels.\n\nWait, let me double-check how many levels there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a level. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...)\n3. 1+3(...)\n...\nSo how many times does \"1+3(...)\" occur? Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end. The expression ends with nine closing parentheses, so that suggests there are nine levels. Wait, but each level is a \"1+3(...)\", so starting from the innermost, each level adds another 1+3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+3\" is nested. Let me try to structure it:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each level wraps it with 1 + 3*(...), and there are 8 such levels, because from the innermost to the outermost, we have 9 expressions, but the outermost is just 3*(...).\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to visualize it as a tree.\n\nThe structure is:\n\nLevel 1: 3*(...)\n\nLevel 2 inside Level 1: 1 + 3*(...)\n\nLevel 3 inside Level 2: 1 + 3*(...)\n\n...\n\nUp to Level 9: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case. So from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each level is 1 + 3*(previous level), and this happens 8 times, because the outermost is 3*(...). So the total number of levels where we compute 1 + 3*(...) is 8.\n\nWait, let me try to count the number of times we have \"1 + 3(...)\":\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen each subsequent level adds another \"1 + 3*(...)\", so how many times does this happen? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each level adds another 1+3*(...). So how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3*(...)\" expressions.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3*, we have 1 + 3*(...), and inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on until we reach the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo the number of times \"1 + 3*(...)\" occurs is 8, because each level is one more than the previous, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the innermost expression is at depth 1: 1 + 3\n\nThen depth 2: 1 + 3*(depth1)\n\nDepth 3: 1 + 3*(depth2)\n\n...\n\nUp to depth 9, which would be the outermost expression before the initial 3*.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 3* is at depth 1, then each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a deeper level.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute each level step by step, carefully, to avoid mistakes.\n\nLet me write down each step with labels for clarity.\n\nLet me denote each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level2)\n\n...\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level9)\n\nSo, starting with Level1:\n\nLevel1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel2: 1 + 3*(Level1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel3: 1 + 3*(Level2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel4: 1 + 3*(Level3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel5: 1 + 3*(Level4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel6: 1 + 3*(Level5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel7: 1 + 3*(Level6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel8: 1 + 3*(Level7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel9: 1 + 3*(Level8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level9) = 3*29524\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes when dealing with multiple levels, it's easy to miscompute a step.\n\nLet me go through each level again quickly:\n\nLevel1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n\u00d7        3\n\n----------\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo writing it down:\n\n29,524\n\n\u00d7        3\n\n----------\n\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this problem. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, so I don't have to compute each level manually.\n\nLooking at the structure, each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). So this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r = 3 and c = 1.\n\nThe solution to this recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = A*r^n = A*3^n\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 holds for each level.\n\nTherefore, Level9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute each level without manually calculating each step, which is more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut in this problem, since there are only 9 levels, computing step by step is manageable, but knowing the formula is helpful for understanding the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about the entire expression is to recognize that it's a geometric series.\n\nEach level is 1 + 3*(previous level), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^k, but in this case, it's a bit more involved because each level multiplies by 3 and adds 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me think. Let me denote S as the entire expression inside the outermost 3*(...), so S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) up to 8 levels.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the Level9, which we've already computed as 29524.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to express S in terms of a geometric series.\n\nWait, considering that each level is 1 + 3*(previous level), which can be written as a recurrence relation.\n\nBut perhaps for the entire expression, S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) up to 8 levels.\n\nWait, if I let S = 1 + 3*S', where S' is the next level. But this might not directly help unless I can find a relation for S in terms of itself.\n\nWait, actually, in this case, since we have a fixed number of levels, it's better to compute it step by step or use the formula we derived earlier.\n\nIn any case, after computing each level up to Level9, we have Level9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step and verifying the results, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each level step by step:\n\n1. Innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost expression:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It looks like a series of 1s and 3s multiplied together with parentheses. I think I need to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That makes sense because parentheses usually indicate the order in which operations should be performed. So, I'll start with the innermost part and then move outward, simplifying each step as I go.\n\nLet me write this out step by step. I'll start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is \"1 + 3\". That seems straightforward. So, let me compute that first.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses.\nStarting from the inside:\n- The innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that.\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, I can replace the innermost parentheses with 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3*(result from the innermost parentheses). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(the previous result). Let me make sure I understand the structure correctly.\n\nLooking at the problem again, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the inside, each time I compute a layer, I can substitute it into the next layer outwards. So, let me try to represent this step by step.\n\nLet me number each layer from the innermost to the outermost to keep track. Let's say there are 9 layers because I see nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count: each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and I can see that there are nine such layers because each opening parenthesis is followed by another 1 + 3(...). Wait, actually, maybe I should count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the problem again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time I have 1 + 3(...). Let's see, the innermost is 1 + 3, then moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, perhaps there are 8 layers? Wait, no, let me count the number of closing parentheses. Each time after 1 + 3, there's a closing parenthesis, so maybe 9 layers? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me try to parse this correctly. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by a series of nested 1 + 3(...). So, let's break it down layer by layer.\n\nLet me represent each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, L1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then L2 is 1 + 3*(L1), and so on, up to L9, which is the outermost layer. Then the entire expression is 3*(L9).\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers there are. The problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3(...), so let's count how many times this occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to 9 layers? Let me see:\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then the next layer is (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. Then (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nEach time, adding another layer of 1 + 3*(previous expression).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis starts a new layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to just start computing step by step, layer by layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let me proceed step by step:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3.\n\n1 + 3 = 4. So, L1 = 4.\n\nStep 2: Move one layer out. The next layer is 1 + 3*(L1). So, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute that: 3*4 = 12, so L2 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Next layer out is L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute 3*13: 39. So, L3 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 = 120, so L4 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 = 363, so L5 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 360*3 = 1080, and 4*3=12, so total is 1080 +12=1092. So, L6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check 3*1093 again.\n\n1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Yes, that's correct. So, L7 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Therefore, L8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break this down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, L9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because 29524 * 3: 29,524 times 3.\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check each step again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me try an alternative approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, let me compute each a_n:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that matches what I had before. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method to compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each calculation, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

Okay, so that part is straightforward. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result of the innermost parentheses). Wait, actually, looking at the structure, each time it's 1 plus 3 times something. Let me make sure I parse this correctly.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression with more spacing to make it clearer:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, since there are 9 layers of parentheses. Let me see:\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nThen, L3: 1 + 3*(L2)\n\nAnd so on, up to L9, and then the entire expression is 3*(L9).\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, after computing L9, I need to multiply by 3 to get the final result. Let me confirm that structure.\n\nYes, the entire expression is 3*(...), and inside, there are 8 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), each time nesting deeper. So, actually, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*previous), and this happens 8 times, and then the outermost 3*().\n\nWait, hold on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n...\nLet me see, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3*(...)), and how many such layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until the 9th layer, I think. Wait, let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each time another (1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost, let's count the number of times we have (1+3(...)).\n\nLet me write it out step by step:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3) \u2192 that's 1.\n- Then moving out, it's (1 + 3*(1 + 3)) \u2192 that's 2.\n- Next, (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) \u2192 that's 3.\n- Continuing this way, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nHow many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, the total number of layers is 9, because in the original expression, starting from the innermost, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses inside the innermost:\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of times I see (1 + 3(...)).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n5. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n6. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n7. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n9. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So, starting from L1 to L9.\n\nSo, L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(L9). So, after computing L9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting over:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so all layers check out. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute this using another method or see if there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n, which might help in computing a_9 without having to compute each step manually.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + C\n\nWhere A and C are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nTo find C, we can solve for the steady-state solution, where a_n = a_{n-1} = C.\n\nSo, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 1\n\n-2*C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}) / 2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048 / 2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the value we computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048 / 2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, that would be 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I used two methods: iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, both leading to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by computing the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n\\[ 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\) starting from the innermost parentheses. \n\n1.

It seems like each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). So, maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to see it more clearly. The innermost part is (1+3). Then each subsequent layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, it's like a chain of operations. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n2. 3 times (1 + 3). Wait, no, let me check. Actually, the next layer is 3 times (1 + the previous result). So, after computing the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4).\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me look again. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me number each layer from the inside out, from layer 1 to layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, that seems a bit large, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent each time. So, the final result after computing all layers is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check again, because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" starting from the inside. Each \"1+3(\" represents a new layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 3*(1+3(...))\n3. Each time, it's another 3*(1+...)\n\nSo, let me count the number of layers:\n\nFrom the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(1+...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"3(\" after each 1+.\n\nStarting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...). Inside that, there's another 3*(1+...), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3( parts. Each time, it's a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 3*(1+3(...))\n3. 3*(1+3(...))\n...\n\nLet me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by (1+3(...)).\n\nLooking at the expression, each opening parenthesis after the first 3(1+3 is a new layer. So, how many opening parentheses are there?\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses after the first 3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the first 3(, there are 8 more opening parentheses. Wait, no, let me count each 3(1+3(...)) as a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to see that each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 3*(1+3(...))\n3. 3*(1+3(...))\n...\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's another 3*(1+3(...)), so the number of layers is 9, because starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1+...).\n\nWait, no, let me count the number of 3*(1+3( in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each subsequent layer is another 3*(1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(1+...). So, how many layers? Let's count the number of times 3*(1+3 is present.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" after the first one adds a new layer. So, the first 3( is layer 1, then each subsequent \"3(\" is another layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1+3(...)), then inside that, another 3(1+3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers? Let me count the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3(, there are 8 more \"3(\" inside. So, total layers are 9.\n\nWait, but when I calculated earlier, I only went up to layer 9, which gave me 36084. So, perhaps that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me try a smaller version to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). Let's compute that.\n\nInnermost: (1+3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nOutermost: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nSo, for 3 layers, the result is 147. Let me compute it directly:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation. Hmm, so my approach is wrong. Wait, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the small example, I have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let's compute it step by step:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nOutermost: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nBut when I compute directly, I get 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so my initial approach is wrong. Because when I computed layer by layer, I got 147, but direct computation gives 120. So, I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, so in the small example, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, the innermost is (1+3)=4. Then, moving outward, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Then, moving outward again, it's 3*(1 + 15) = 48. Then, the outermost is 3*(1 + 48) = 147. But when I compute directly, it's 120. So, that suggests that my layer approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the small example, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let's compute it step by step:\n\nFirst, compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, compute 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nNext, moving outward, compute 1 + 15 = 16, then 3*16 = 48.\n\nFinally, moving outward, compute 1 + 48 = 49, then 3*49 = 147.\n\nBut when I compute directly, I get 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so there's a discrepancy here. That suggests that my method of computing each layer as 3*(1 + previous) is wrong. Because in the small example, the correct result is 120, but my layer approach gave me 147.\n\nSo, I must have misapplied the layers. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nIn the small example: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + [3*(1 + [3*(1 + 3)] ]))\n\nSo, the innermost is 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nThen, moving outward, it's 3*(1 + 12) = 39.\n\nThen, moving outward, it's 3*(1 + 39) = 120.\n\nWait, so that's different from my earlier approach. So, in this case, the innermost is 3*(1 + 3) = 12, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 12) = 39, then the outermost is 3*(1 + 39) = 120.\n\nSo, in this case, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer's result). So, in the small example, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 120.\n\nWait, so in my initial approach, I was adding 1 to the previous layer's result before multiplying by 3. But in the small example, that approach gave me the wrong answer.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIf I compute the innermost as (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nThen, outermost: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nBut that's wrong because the correct answer is 120.\n\nSo, what's the issue here? It seems that the innermost operation is 3*(1 + 3), not (1 + 3). So, perhaps I misapplied the structure.\n\nWait, looking back at the original problem:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nEach layer is 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is the next layer. So, the innermost is 3*(1 + 3), then the next layer is 3*(1 + result of innermost), etc.\n\nSo, in the small example, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, the innermost is 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 12) = 39.\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(1 + 39) = 120.\n\nSo, in this case, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer's result). So, starting from the innermost, it's 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo, in the original problem, I need to compute starting from the innermost 3*(1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo, in my initial approach, I started with (1 + 3) = 4, then 3*(1 + 4) = 15, etc., but that was incorrect because the innermost operation is 3*(1 + 3), not (1 + 3).\n\nSo, let me correct my approach.\n\nLet me redefine the layers correctly, starting from the innermost as 3*(1 + 3).\n\nSo, for the original problem, the innermost is 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo, let's redefine the layers correctly:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but the original problem has 9 layers, right? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + ...), and the innermost is 3*(1 + 3). So, starting from that, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo, let's count the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: 3*(1 + 3) = 12 (Layer 1)\n2. Next: 3*(1 + 12) = 39 (Layer 2)\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 39) = 120 (Layer 3)\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 120) = 363 (Layer 4)\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 363) = 1092 (Layer 5)\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279 (Layer 6)\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840 (Layer 7)\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523 (Layer 8)\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572 (Layer 9)\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I had 9 layers, but I started with (1 + 3) = 4, then 3*(1 + 4) = 15, etc., which gave me 36084. But that was incorrect because I misapplied the structure.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to start with the innermost as 3*(1 + 3) = 12, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, the correct final result is 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this with a smaller example to make sure.\n\nTake the small example again: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nAs we saw earlier, the correct result is 120.\n\nUsing the corrected approach:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n\nWhich matches the correct result. So, my initial mistake was starting with (1 + 3) instead of 3*(1 + 3).\n\nTherefore, applying this corrected approach to the original problem:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 363) = 1092\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this again to be sure. Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again to make sure I'm computing the correct number of layers.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + ...)\n3. Each time, it's another 3*(1 + ...)\n\nSo, how many times does 3*(1 + ... occur?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3*(1 + ... is the innermost, then each subsequent 3*(1 + ... is another layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 3*(1 + ... adds a new layer.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3*(1 + ... appears.\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1 + ...:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n...\n\nEach time, it's another layer. So, how many layers?\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 3*(1 + ... adds a new layer. So, the number of layers is 9, because there are 9 sets of 3*(1 + ... starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, no, actually, each opening parenthesis after the first 3(1+3( adds a new layer. So, the first 3*(1 + ... is layer 1, then each subsequent 3*(1 + ... is another layer.\n\nSo, in the original expression, how many 3*(1 + ... are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + ...)\n3. 3*(1 + ...)\n4. 3*(1 + ...)\n5. 3*(1 + ...)\n6. 3*(1 + ...)\n7. 3*(1 + ...)\n8. 3*(1 + ...)\n9. 3*(1 + ...)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. So, the final result after 9 layers is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me compute this using another method to confirm.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that this expression is a form of a geometric series. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, perhaps we can model this recursively.\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, such that:\n\nf(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nf(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1))\n\nSo, for n = 1: 12\n\nn = 2: 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n\nn = 3: 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1))\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\nf(n) = a*r^n + b\n\nWhere r is the common ratio, which is 3 in this case, and b is a constant.\n\nLet me solve for f(n):\n\nAssume f(n) = a*3^n + b\n\nThen, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)) = 3 + 3*f(n-1)\n\nSo, substituting f(n) = a*3^n + b into the equation:\n\na*3^n + b = 3 + 3*(a*3^{n-1} + b)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 3 + 3*a*3^{n-1} + 3*b\n\n= 3 + a*3^n + 3b\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\na*3^n + b = a*3^n + 3b + 3\n\nSubtract a*3^n from both sides:\n\nb = 3b + 3\n\nThen, -2b = 3 => b = -3/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition f(1) = 12:\n\nf(1) = a*3^1 + b = 3a + (-3/2) = 12\n\nSo, 3a - 3/2 = 12\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n3a = 12 + 3/2 = 27/2\n\nThus, a = (27/2)/3 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\nf(n) = (9/2)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nf(n) = (9*3^n)/2 - 3/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2\n\nWait, because 9 = 3^2, so 9*3^n = 3^{n+2}.\n\nSo, f(n) = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2\n\nNow, for n = 9 layers:\n\nf(9) = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^11:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, f(9) = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nWhich matches our earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as 3 times (1 plus the result of the previous layer). After computing each layer, we find that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

I think the best way is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part here is the last \"1+3\". Let me write down each step as I go along.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3.\n\nLet me do that first.\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so now I can replace the innermost parentheses with 4. So the next layer out is:\n\n2. Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 1).\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Let me check that.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... and so on.\n\nSo each time, it's 1 + 3*(next expression). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, which is 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from that), and so on.\n\nSo let me list each step one by one.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next parentheses is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So:\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo step 2 gives me 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, the next parentheses is 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So:\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39.\n\nThen 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo step 3 gives me 40.\n\nNext layer out is:\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(result from step 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\nCompute 3*40: 120.\n\nThen 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nSo step 4 gives me 121.\n\nMoving out another layer:\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(result from step 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\nCompute 3*121: Let's see, 120*3=360, and 1*3=3, so 360+3=363.\n\nThen 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nSo step 5 gives me 364.\n\nNext layer:\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(result from step 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\nCompute 3*364: Hmm, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nThen 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSo step 6 gives me 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer:\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(result from step 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nThen 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nSo step 7 gives me 3280.\n\nNext layer:\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(result from step 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840.\n\nThen 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nSo step 8 gives me 9841.\n\nMoving out another layer:\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(result from step 8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3.\n\nFirst, 9000*3=27000.\n\n800*3=2400.\n\n40*3=120.\n\n1*3=3.\n\nNow add them all together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nThen 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo step 9 gives me 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is:\n\nStep 10: 3*(result from step 9) = 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nSo:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n24*3 = 72\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo step 10 gives me 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that calculation again because 29524 * 3.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\n88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, let me verify that step-by-step multiplication.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\n5*3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\n9*3=27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\nSo the result is 88572. That's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each step builds on the previous one, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards.\n\nLet me list all the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check step 3 again. Step 3 is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, 3*1=3, so 363. 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. 900+180=1080 +12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280.

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to figure out how to approach this. It seems like each part is of the form 3 times something, and inside that something, there's another 1 plus 3 times something else. It's like a repeating pattern. Maybe I can solve it by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Let's denote each level of the parentheses as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Starting from the innermost, which is Level 9, and moving outward.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 9)\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 8)\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 1: 3*(Level 2)\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the original problem, each level is multiplied by 3 after adding 1. So perhaps each Level n is 1 + 3*(Level n+1). Let me check.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 9)\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 8)\n\n...\n\nLevel 1: 3*(Level 2)\n\nWait, actually, in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...)), so each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So Level 1 is 1 + 3*(Level 2), Level 2 is 1 + 3*(Level 3), and so on until Level 9 is 1 + 3. Then, after computing Level 9, we compute Level 8, and so on, until we reach Level 1, which is then multiplied by 3. Hmm, actually, wait. The entire expression is 3*(Level 1), where Level 1 is 1 + 3*(Level 2), and Level 2 is 1 + 3*(Level 3), etc., down to Level 9, which is 1 + 3. So, perhaps I need to compute from Level 9 up to Level 1, then multiply by 3.\n\nLet me try to structure this:\n\nCompute Level 9 first:\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Level 1) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check that. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, yes, each level is 1 + 3*(next level), starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3. So, computing each level step by step as I did above.\n\nSo, Level 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524: Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72.\n\nWait, actually, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute 29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7, write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 =15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many levels.\n\nLet me recompute each level:\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121=1 + 363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only 9 levels, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So, each level can be represented recursively as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n+1), with L(9)=4.\n\nSo, we can compute L(8)=1 + 3*4=13, L(7)=1 + 3*13=40, etc., as I did before.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each level of the parentheses as Level 1 to Level 9, starting from the innermost. Each level is computed as follows:\n\n- **Level 9**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- **Level 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- **Level 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- **Level 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- **Level 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- **Level 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- **Level 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- **Level 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- **Level 1**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Level 1 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me read it again: Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))). Hmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, it seems like each level adds another layer of parentheses. So the very innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm reading this correctly. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next parentheses. So, starting from the inside:\n\nFirst, compute 1 + 3, which is 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, it's 1 + 3*(result from above). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me calculate that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nNext layer out, it's again 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nWait a second, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. Let me confirm that. \n\nSo, the first innermost is 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Next, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again because I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? So, starting from the innermost, each step corresponds to one layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nWait, so that's nine layers, right? So after the ninth layer, the result is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result, so 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the final step was 1 + 3*29524, which would be 88573. But that seems incorrect because the outermost layer is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, let me clarify: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the last result.\n\nSo, step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by adding an extra step. The expression is 3 times the result of the innermost expression, which after nine layers is 29524. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nLet me confirm each step again to be sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step, I'm multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, after nine steps, I get 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes I might make a mistake there. Let's compute 3*29524.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n*    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nNow, the next digit is 9 (from 29524, which is 2 9 5 2 4). Wait, no, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3, we go from right to left:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n+29524\n+29524\n= ?\n\nLet's add them step by step.\n\nFirst, add 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n2 + 2 = 4\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1\n9 + 9 = 18 +1=19, write down 9, carry over 1\n2 + 2=4 +1=5\n\nSo, 29524 +29524=59048.\n\nNow, add 59048 +29524:\n\n59048 +29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 +4=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n4 +2=6 +1=7\n0 +5=5\n9 +9=18, write down 8, carry over 1\n5 +2=7 +1=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That's the same as before. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps, let me recompute each step from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 +3=4\n2. Next: 1 +3*4=1+12=13\n3. Next: 1 +3*13=1+39=40\n4. Next: 1 +3*40=1+120=121\n5. Next: 1 +3*121=1+363=364\n6. Next: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n7. Next: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n8. Next: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n9. Next: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, after nine layers, we get 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives us 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.

It looks like a recursive expression where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). I think I can solve this by working from the innermost parentheses outwards. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the expression has multiple layers of 3(1 + ... ). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost part is 1+3, which is inside the first parentheses.\n2. Then each layer adds another 3(1 + ...) around it.\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses. Let me count them:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So starting from the inside:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to nine layers.\n\nWait, actually, let me check again. The expression is written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses. Each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the end:\n\n- The first closing parenthesis after the innermost 3 is at position 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, actually, there are nine layers of 3(...).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by starting from the innermost parentheses and work our way out, calculating each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built by the expression 3(1 + previous term). So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, let's compute each step.\n\nLet me try to write this down:\n\nLet me define:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have:\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, but I think I might be making a mistake here because each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so maybe I should define it as:\n\na\u2081 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nWait, that might be a better approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + the result of the inner layer). So each a_i is 3*(1 + a_{i-1}).\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3, each 3*(1 + ...) is a layer. Let me count how many times 3*(1 + ...) occurs. Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...), which is the innermost layer.\n- Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, computing each step.\n\nLet me try again:\n\n1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check: the original expression has how many layers? Let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3*(1 + ...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach 3*(1 + ... starts a new layer. So:\n\n- The first 3*(1 + ... is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is the innermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to parse the expression step by step.\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + ...), so does that mean there are nine layers? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of 3(...):\n\n- The innermost is 3(1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So how many 3(...) are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times 3(1+...) appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3(1+3)\n2. 3(1+3(1+3))\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many 3(1+...) are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...):\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n- 1+3 is layer 1, then 3*(1 + layer1) is layer2, and so on until layer9.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the outermost 3*(1 + ...) is layer9, and the innermost is layer1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each time we have a 3*(1 + ...), that's a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 3*(1 + 3), that's layer1, then the next layer is 3*(1 + layer1), layer2, etc., up to layer9.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the innermost is 1+3, which is part of the first 3*(1 + ...). Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nLet me write the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Then, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. Next layer out: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here because the original expression has 9 layers, but when I count the layers, I started from (1+3) as layer1, then each subsequent 3*(1 + ...) as layers 2 through 9. But when I computed up to layer9, I got 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check if I actually have nine layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), so the first opening parenthesis is after the first 3.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3(1+... adds another opening parenthesis.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1+3(...))\n\n2. Then, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), so let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3, the expression is (1+3(...)), which itself contains another (1+3(...)), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 3(1+3 appears.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I should count the number of 3(1+... in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is the innermost layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent 3(1+... is a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, as I did earlier, and see what I get.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so after nine layers, I get 36084 as the result.\n\nBut let me verify this because sometimes when I count layers, I might miscount. Let me check how many times I applied the 3*(1 + ...) operation.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a different approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that this expression is a geometric series. Let me see if I can express it in terms of a geometric series.\n\nEach layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define the innermost as a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nWait, but this seems different from my earlier calculations. Wait, did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to define the sequence correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a\u2080 = 1\n\nThen, a\u2081 = 1 + 3*a\u2080 = 1 + 3*1 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but this is a different result than before. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the original expression, the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers is nine, so perhaps the sequence should go up to a\u2089.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I considered the innermost as layer1: 1 + 3 = 4, then layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15, layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48, etc., up to layer9: 36084.\n\nBut in the second approach, using a\u2080 to a\u2089, I get a\u2089 = 29524, which is different.\n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the initial 3*(1 + ...) is included in the layer count.\n\nLet me clarify: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so the outermost operation is 3*(1 + ...), which would correspond to a\u2081 in the second approach.\n\nWait, let me try to align both approaches.\n\nIn the first approach:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 48\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 36084\n\nIn the second approach, using a\u2080 = 1,\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3*a\u2080 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 40\n\n...\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the original expression is 3*(1 + ...), which would correspond to 3*a\u2089 in the second approach, where a\u2089 is the result of the innermost expression.\n\nWait, let me try to model it correctly.\n\nLet me define the innermost expression as a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nSo:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 3*(1 + a\u2081) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na\u2083 = 3*(1 + a\u2082) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na\u2084 = 3*(1 + a\u2083) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na\u2085 = 3*(1 + a\u2084) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na\u2086 = 3*(1 + a\u2085) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na\u2087 = 3*(1 + a\u2086) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na\u2088 = 3*(1 + a\u2087) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na\u2089 = 3*(1 + a\u2088) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, according to this, the result is 36084.\n\nBut in the second approach, where I defined a\u2080 = 1, and then a\u2081 = 1 + 3*a\u2080 = 4, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 13, etc., I got a different result. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the initial 1 is included in the layers. Let me think again.\n\nIn the original expression, the entire expression is 3*(1 + ...), so it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So the outermost operation is 3*(1 + ...), which is the first layer.\n\nWait, perhaps in my first approach, I was correct, and the result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model it as a geometric series.\n\nLet me consider that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, the sequence is:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check this using another method. Perhaps I can express this as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nLet me consider that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value at the nth layer.\n\nThen, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) for n >= 2\n\nSo, we can write:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, a_9 is 36084, which is the result after nine layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 3\n\nC - 3C = 3\n\n-2C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. We have a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 3/2 = 3A - 3/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nThus, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can write this as a_n = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2\n\nSimplify further:\n\na_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15, which matches.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48, correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147, correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (11*243 - 9)/6 = (2673 - 9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444, correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (11*729 - 9)/6 = (8019 - 9)/6 = 8010/6 = 1335, correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (11*2187 - 9)/6 = (24057 - 9)/6 = 24048/6 = 4008, correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (11*6561 - 9)/6 = (72171 - 9)/6 = 72162/6 = 12027, correct.\n\nn=9:\n\na_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216513 - 9)/6 = 216504/6 = 36084, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, using the closed-form solution, we can directly compute a_9 as 36084.\n\nTherefore, the result of the original expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more by computing a_9 using the formula:\n\na_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nFor n=9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683\n\nSo, 11*19683 = let's compute:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n196830 + 19683 = 216,513\n\nThen, 216,513 - 9 = 216,504\n\nDivide by 6: 216,504 / 6 = 36,084\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36,084.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I've checked it using two different methods: step-by-step computation and a closed-form solution derived from the recurrence relation. Both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 36084 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression involving multiple layers of 3 times (1 plus another expression). By breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can compute the result step by step or derive a closed-form solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Computation:**\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{36084}"

I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each layer step by step without getting confused.\n\nAlright, so let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. The innermost part is (1+3). Then, moving outwards, each subsequent layer is 3 times something plus 1, and so on. Let me try to break it down layer by layer.\n\nLet me start by labeling each layer for clarity. I'll number them from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1\n\nWait, actually, looking at the expression, each layer after the innermost is 3 times (1 + 3*(next layer)). Hmm, maybe I should write each step more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute each layer starting from the innermost. Let me see how many layers there are. Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\nStarting from the innermost, there's (1+3), then each time it's wrapped in another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of times this happens.\n\nLet's see: starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(next layer). The original expression has 9 layers, I think. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there's a (1 + 3), then each layer wraps another (1 + 3*(...)), so that's 8 layers after the first one, but let me count.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to just compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, but looking back at the original problem, each layer after the first is 3*(previous layer) + 1? Or is it 1 + 3*(next layer)? Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.\n\nWait, let me look again. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)).\n\nWait, but when I look at L1, it's (1 + 3). Then, L2 is 3*(1 + 3*(L1)). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)), so starting from the innermost, let's compute each step.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write the expression as:\n\nLet me denote the innermost as L1, then each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\n\nWait, but looking back, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, but that seems different. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is built as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(next expression)). So, let's compute each step:\n\nLet me number the layers from 1 to 8, as there are 8 layers after the initial 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach it as follows:\n\nLet me compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\n\nWait, but no, because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so Layer 2 would be 3*(1 + 3*(Layer1)).\n\nWait, so perhaps Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer1)).\n\nSo, Layer1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2 = 3*(1 + 3*(Layer1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, but that's different from my previous calculation. So, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So, starting from Layer1, which is (1 + 3), then Layer2 is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer1)), and so on.\n\nWait, so let me try that again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer3)) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer4)) = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer5)) = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258,339\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer6)) = 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer7)) = 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot of layers, and I'm not sure if I'm counting correctly. Let me check again how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, starting from there, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9, because each (1 + 3(...)) is a new layer, and there are 9 of them, including the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I should number them as L1 to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer8, I was at 20,925,489. But let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me try to count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(39)) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(354)) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189\n\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(3189)) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704\n\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(28704)) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258,339\n\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(258339)) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054\n\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(2,325,054)) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489\n\n9. 3*(1 + 3*(20,925,489)) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each time computing the next layer as 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, the final result would be 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258,339.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nBut let me verify each step again because it's easy to make a multiplication error.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.

Let's compute 9568 * 3: 9000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 60*3=180; 8*3=24. Adding up: 27,000 + 1,500 = 28,500; +180 = 28,680; +24 = 28,704. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113. 86,113 * 3: 80,000*3=240,000; 6,000*3=18,000; 100*3=300; 10*3=30; 3*3=9.

Let's compute 775,018 * 3: 700,000*3=2,100,000; 70,000*3=210,000; 5,000*3=15,000; 18*3=54. Adding up: 2,100,000 + 210,000 = 2,310,000; +15,000 = 2,325,000; +54 = 2,325,054. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163.

Correct.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468. Let's compute 62,776,468 * 3:\n\n60,000,000 * 3 = 180,000,000\n\n2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000\n\n700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n\n70,000 * 3 = 210,000\n\n6,000 * 3 = 18,000\n\n400 * 3 = 1,200\n\n60 * 3 = 180\n\n8 * 3 = 24\n\nAdding up:\n\n180,000,000 + 6,000,000 = 186,000,000\n\n+2,100,000 = 188,100,000\n\n+210,000 = 188,310,000\n\n+18,000 = 188,328,000\n\n+1,200 = 188,329,200\n\n+180 = 188,329,380\n\n+24 = 188,329,404.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To make sure, maybe I can check with a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct.\n\nFor example, let's take a smaller version:\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nFollowing the same method:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nSo, the result would be 354.\n\nLet me compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, outer layer: 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation. Wait, what's happening here.\n\nWait, in this smaller example, according to my step-by-step method, I got 354, but when I compute it directly, I get 120.\n\nWait, that means I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, let me see. The original expression was 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, let me compute it step by step.\n\nCompute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, outer layer: 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nBut according to my earlier method, I was computing each layer as 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)), starting from the innermost. But in this case, the innermost is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost), which is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120.\n\nWait, so in this case, the correct answer is 120, but according to my earlier method, I got 354. That means my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong? Let me see.\n\nIn the original problem, I thought each layer was 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)), but in the smaller example, that approach gave me the wrong result. So, perhaps I misapplied the structure.\n\nWait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)), but the next layer is another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nSo, in that case, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)), but the next layer is another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I was treating each layer as 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)), which seems to be incorrect because in the smaller example, the correct result is 120, but according to my method, I was getting 354, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach was wrong because I miscounted the layers. Let me try to correct that.\n\nWait, in the smaller example, there are three layers after the initial 3*(...). Let me see:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n\nSo, in this case, Layer3 is the outermost layer, and it's 3*(1 + 3*(Layer2)).\n\nWait, so in my initial approach, I was computing each layer as 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)), but in reality, the first layer after the innermost is 1 + 3*(previous layer), not 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nWait, that seems to be the confusion. So, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct way is:\n\nEach layer alternates between being 1 + 3*(next layer) and 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)).\n\nWait, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer), except for the outermost layer, which is 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nwith a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, for the smaller example with three layers, the outermost layer would be 3*a_2, where a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and then 3*a_2 = 3*13 = 39, but that's not matching the smaller example's correct result of 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is structured as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(next expression). Then, the outermost layer is 3*(innermost expression).\n\nWait, let's take the smaller example:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nOutermost layer: 3*(13) = 39\n\nWait, but when I compute it directly, I get 120, but according to this, it's 39. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the parentheses.\n\nWait, the original smaller example is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nOutermost layer: 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(inner expression)).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3 * [1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3))]\n\nCompute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nThen, compute the outer layer: 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so in this case, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)), where the next layer is 13.\n\nSo, in the smaller example, the result is 120, not 39.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial approach in the original problem was incorrect because I treated each layer as 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)), but in reality, the first layer after the innermost is 1 + 3*(innermost), then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)), and so on, alternating.\n\nWait, that complicates things, but perhaps that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure alternates between 1 + 3*(...) and 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, let me try to model it correctly.\n\nLet me consider the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 360 = 361\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer4)) = 3*(1 + 1083) = 3*1084 = 3252\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 9756 = 9757\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer6)) = 3*(1 + 29,271) = 3*29,272 = 87,816\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 263,448 = 263,449\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer8)) = 3*(1 + 790,347) = 3*790,348 = 2,371,044\n\nWait, but that's only 9 layers, but the original problem seems to have more layers. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer alternates between being 1 + 3*(previous) and 3*(1 + 3*(previous)), depending on the depth.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, and then the entire expression is 3*a_n.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but that's different from my earlier result of 188,329,404. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which suggests that each layer after the innermost is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)).\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, I saw that the correct result was 120, which would correspond to a_3 = 40, then 3*a_3 = 120.\n\nSo, perhaps in the original problem, the number of layers is 9, meaning that a_9 = 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier step-by-step calculation where I got 188,329,404.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconcile this discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of layers. Let me count the number of times 3*(1 + 3*(...)) occurs.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and the outermost layer is 3*(...).\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outwards:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1,093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 3,280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 9,841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 29,524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I treated each layer as 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)), leading to a much larger number. So, perhaps the correct approach is to model it as a sequence where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 4, and then multiply the final layer by 3.\n\nSo, in the smaller example, with three layers:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 13\n\nLayer3: 40\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*40 = 120, which matches the correct result.\n\nSo, in the original problem, with nine layers:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 13\n\nLayer3: 40\n\nLayer4: 121\n\nLayer5: 364\n\nLayer6: 1,093\n\nLayer7: 3,280\n\nLayer8: 9,841\n\nLayer9: 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my initial step-by-step calculation where I treated each layer as 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)), leading to 188 million.\n\nSo, clearly, I made a mistake in my initial approach by miscounting the structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to model each layer as 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 4, and then multiply the final result by "

It looks like a chain of operations where each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me try to break this down from the inside out because that's usually how you handle nested expressions.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. Let me write that down step by step.\n\n1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). Wait, no, actually, each time it's 1 + 3*(the next level). Let me clarify that.\n\nWait, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each level is 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the next level). So starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, then each step builds on that.\n\nLet me list the steps one by one, starting from the innermost and working outward. I'll assign each step a number for clarity.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: Next level out: 1 + 3*(result from Step 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo Step 2 result: 13\n\nStep 3: Next level out: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39\n\nThen 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 3 result: 40\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the original expression, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the result from the inner expression.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, hold on, that's a big jump. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this more systematically. Let me represent each level as a function, maybe f(n) where n is the level, starting from the innermost as level 1.\n\nSo f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression has nine levels of nesting, right? Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each 3*(...) is another level. Let me count the number of 3*(...) parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n... and so on, until the outermost 3*(...)\n\nSo, how many times do we have 3*(...)?\n\nLet me see: the innermost is 1+3, then each step adds another 3*(...) until we have 9 levels of 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to f(9) = 29524, but let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in one of the steps. Let me go through each step again carefully.\n\nStep 1: f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: f(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: f(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: f(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: f(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: f(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: f(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 steps, the innermost expression becomes 29524.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )), so after computing f(9) = 29524, we then have to multiply by 3, right?\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each level is 3*(...), so the outermost operation is 3*(f(9)).\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, f(9) is already the result after 9 levels of 3*(...). Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps each f(n) is the result after n levels, so f(1) is the innermost, and then the outermost is f(9). But the original expression is 3*(f(9)), so maybe I need to multiply f(9) by 3 again.\n\nWait, let me clarify the structure.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, each level is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, step 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nstep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nstep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nstep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nstep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nstep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nstep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nstep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nstep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nBut the entire expression is 3*(result of step 9), right? Because the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, no, actually, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the result after step 9 is the inner part, and then we multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in my calculation, step 9 was 1 + 3*(step 8), which is the innermost part of the entire expression. So perhaps the total expression is 3*(step 9 result).\n\nWait, let me think again. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is step 1: 4\n\nThen, each subsequent step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, step 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(29524) because the outermost operation is 3*(...), where ... is the result of step 9.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n3 * 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n3 * 5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n3 * 9 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the outermost operation was 3*(step 9), but in my initial calculation, I stopped at step 9 as 29,524, which would then be multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the structure again. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, after 9 levels, we have 1 + 3*(...), which is 29,524, and then the outermost 3* that.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of 3*(...) parts. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\n2. 3*(1 + 3)\n\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\n...\n\nEach time, we add another 3*(...) until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of 3*(...) is 9, meaning that step 9 is the innermost 1 + 3, and then each step outward adds another 3*(...). Hmm, maybe I got the steps wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), starting from f(0) = 1, but that might not fit here.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps the expression is built as follows:\n\nLet me define each level as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) because the outermost operation is 3*(...), where ... is the result of Level 9.\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I counted the levels, I thought Level 9 would be the innermost, but perhaps it's the other way around.\n\nWait, no, starting from the innermost, Level 1 is 1 + 3, then each subsequent Level adds another layer outward. So, after 9 levels, the outermost is 3*(Level 9), which would be 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculation of 29,524 * 3 again to be sure.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that 3 * 29,524 is indeed 88,572 by another method. Let's break down 29,524 into 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24.\n\n3 * 20,000 = 60,000\n\n3 * 9,000 = 27,000\n\n3 * 500 = 1,500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of levels. The original expression has nine 3*(...) terms. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied in the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\n9. The outermost expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nWait, so in this counting, after 9 levels, we end up with 88,572. So that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here.\n\nLooking at the recursive formula: f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nApplying the recurrence relation:\n\nf(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1)\n\nAssume f(n) = A*3^n + B\n\nThen f(n-1) = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, LHS: A*3^n + B = RHS: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\nf(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\nf(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 levels, n=9:\n\nf(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049\n\nSo, f(9) = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nWait, but hold on, in the closed-form solution, f(n) already includes the 3*(...) parts up to n levels. So, in our problem, we have 9 levels, so f(9) = 29,524, and the outermost expression is 3*f(9), which would be 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but actually, in the closed-form solution, f(n) is defined as the value after n levels, so if the expression has 9 levels, then f(9) is the innermost part, and the outermost is 3*f(9), which would be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider n=1: f(1) = 4, which is 1 + 3, correct.\n\nn=2: f(2) = 13, which is 1 + 3*4, correct.\n\nSo, f(n) is the result after n levels, starting from the innermost. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*f(9), which is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute f(n) using the closed-form formula for n=9:\n\nf(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*f(9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression is designed so that each level is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), and after 9 levels, we have f(9), and the entire expression is 3*f(9).\n\nWait, but actually, in the problem statement, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and the outermost is 3*(result after 9 layers).\n\nSo, yes, that would be 3*f(9) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me compute the expression step by step without using the closed-form formula.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost operation is 3*(29524) = 88,572\n\nYes, that's consistent with the earlier calculations.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers, let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new level. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, which would correspond to 9 levels of nesting. So, the innermost is the 9th opening parenthesis, and then each closing parenthesis corresponds to each level.\n\nTherefore, the outermost operation is 3*(result of 9 levels), which is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've verified this in multiple ways, so I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each level as \\( f(n) \\) where \\( n \\) is the level, starting from the innermost as level 1.\n\n1. Innermost expression: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Next level out: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. Next level out: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. Next level out: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. Next level out: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. Next level out: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. Next level out: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. Next level out: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. Next level out: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost expression up to level 9, we have \\( f(9) = 29524 \\).\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\times f(9) \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It looks like a series of expressions where each one is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and this pattern repeats multiple times. Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built from the inside out. That is, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, maybe I can start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work my way outward. That seems like a logical approach because each step depends on the result of the previous one.\n\nLet me write down the expression step by step, starting from the innermost part.\n\nThe innermost part is 1 + 3, which is straightforward. Let's compute that first:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me check the original expression again. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, the next layer after 1 + 3 is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me denote each step as S1, S2, S3, etc., where each S stands for a step or a layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer, we have:\n\nS2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nSo, 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, S2 = 13\n\nNext layer out:\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13:\n\n3*13 = 39\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, S3 = 40\n\nContinuing outward:\n\nS4: 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute 3*40:\n\n3*40 = 120\n\nThen, 1 + 120 = 121\n\nSo, S4 = 121\n\nNext layer:\n\nS5: 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121:\n\n3*120 = 360, so 3*121 = 363\n\nThen, 1 + 363 = 364\n\nSo, S5 = 364\n\nContinuing:\n\nS6: 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364:\n\nLet me compute 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nSo, S6 = 1093\n\nNext layer:\n\nS7: 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093:\n\nLet me break it down: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nSo, S7 = 3280\n\nMoving out another layer:\n\nS8: 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280:\n\nWell, 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nSo, S8 = 9841\n\nNext layer:\n\nS9: 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\nLet me do this step by step. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3\n\nSo, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, S9 = 29524\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer:\n\nS10: 1 + 3*S9 = 1 + 3*29524\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\nLet me break it down again. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nThen, 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nSo, S10 = 88573\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(S10). Let me check again. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so after computing the innermost S1 up to S10, we have S10 as 88573, and then the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that.\n\nWait, no, let me make sure. Let me count the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 3(1 + ...) occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nEach layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let's count how many times 3(1 + ...) occurs.\n\nLet me parse it:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(...), so each layer adds another 3*(...).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3( ... )) where ... is the previous one\n3. Repeating until we have 9 layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a parenthesis:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, each layer is 3*(...). So, starting from 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), etc.\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3(1 + ...), it's 9 times. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of nested layers.\n\nEach time we have 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3) \u2192 1 layer\n- Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), so up to 9 layers.\n\nWait, let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 instances of (1 + 3), each nested inside the previous one. So, each step S1 to S9, and then the outermost 3*(S9). Wait, no, in my earlier steps, I had S1 to S10 because I included the outermost 3*(...). Hmm, perhaps I overcounted.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's count the number of 3*(...) layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 S1: 4\n2. 3*(S1) added to 1 \u2192 S2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 3*(S2) added to 1 \u2192 S3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 3*(S3) added to 1 \u2192 S4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 3*(S4) added to 1 \u2192 S5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 3*(S5) added to 1 \u2192 S6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 3*(S6) added to 1 \u2192 S7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 3*(S7) added to 1 \u2192 S8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 3*(S8) added to 1 \u2192 S9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 3*(S9) added to 1 \u2192 S10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Then, the entire expression is 3*(S10) \u2192 3*88573 = ?\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(S9), where S9 is 1 + 3*(...). Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, let me parse the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 S1: 4\n2. Then, 3*(S1) added to 1 \u2192 S2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Then, 3*(S2) added to 1 \u2192 S3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Then, 3*(S3) added to 1 \u2192 S4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Then, 3*(S4) added to 1 \u2192 S5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Then, 3*(S5) added to 1 \u2192 S6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Then, 3*(S6) added to 1 \u2192 S7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Then, 3*(S7) added to 1 \u2192 S8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Then, 3*(S8) added to 1 \u2192 S9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Then, the entire expression is 3*(S9) \u2192 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. So, in this case, after S9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(S9). So, that would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought S10 was 88573, which is 1 + 3*29524. But now, according to the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would be 3*S9, where S9 is 29524. So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again. It's:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and this happens 9 times, and then the outermost is 3*(...). So, in my earlier steps, S1 to S9 are the layers inside, and then the outermost is 3*(S9). So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including the outermost 3*(...) as S10, but actually, the expression is 3*(S9), where S9 is the result after 9 layers.\n\nWait, let's recount:\n\n1. Innermost: S1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. S3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. S4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. S5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. S6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. S7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. S8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. S9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(S9) = 3*29524\n\nSo, I think I overcounted earlier by one step. So, the correct computation is up to S9, and then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, let me compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, compute 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me do this step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n- 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nWait, let me write it as:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nMultiplying each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572\n\nWait, that's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed S10, I got 88573, which was 1 + 3*29524, but now I realize that the entire expression is just 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 S1 = 4\n2. 3*(S1) added to 1 \u2192 S2 = 13\n3. 3*(S2) added to 1 \u2192 S3 = 40\n4. 3*(S3) added to 1 \u2192 S4 = 121\n5. 3*(S4) added to 1 \u2192 S5 = 364\n6. 3*(S5) added to 1 \u2192 S6 = 1093\n7. 3*(S6) added to 1 \u2192 S7 = 3280\n8. 3*(S7) added to 1 \u2192 S8 = 9841\n9. 3*(S8) added to 1 \u2192 S9 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(S9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's the correct computation.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought S10 was 88573, which was 1 + 3*29524, but that would be if there was another layer. But according to the original problem, the expression ends after 9 layers inside, and then the outermost 3*(...). So, I think my initial approach was correct up to S9, and then the final step is 3*S9.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me just make sure by computing 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed S10, I got 88573, which was 1 + 3*29524, which would be 88573, but that's not the case here because the problem doesn't have an extra layer. So, I think I confused myself earlier by adding an extra step, but upon re-examining, the correct computation is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result)\n- Do this 9 times, resulting in S9 = 29524\n- Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result), and this pattern repeats nine times. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me read it again: Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. I think the way to tackle this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. So, let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to make it a bit clearer. The expression is 3 times a sum, which itself contains another 3 times a sum, and this pattern continues multiple times. It seems like a recursive structure where each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me try to parse it.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Then, moving one step out, we have 3 times that result plus 1. Wait, no, actually, let me check the structure again. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + previous expression).\n\nWait, maybe I should number these layers to keep track. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + result from step 1)\n3. Next: 3*(1 + result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see: from the innermost, each time there's a 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 parts.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...), and each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nWait, actually, each time we go out a layer, we add another 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me confirm:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step out adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers? Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: 3*(1 + (1 + 3))\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1 + 3)))\nWait, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Wait, but let me count how many layers there are.\n\nWait, the original expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, inside it is (1 + 3(...)), and each of those has another (1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts:\n\n1. The first innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...):\n\nFrom the expression, starting after the first 3, each layer is 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: (1 + 3(...))\n3. Next: (1 + 3(...))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, the number of layers is 9 because starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3, and each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote L1 as the innermost layer: L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, up to L9, which would be the outermost layer. Then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from L1 = 1 + 3, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, etc., up to L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but let me check: the innermost is (1 + 3), which is L1 = 4.\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. Because sometimes when you have nested parentheses, it's easy to miscount.\n\nWait, the original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many times does 1 + 3(...) occur? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions.\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 + 3(...), and each time, inside that 3(...) is another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first inner parenthesis is (1 + 3(...)), which is L1. Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), which is L2, and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many layers? Let's see: the innermost is (1 + 3), which is L1. Then each layer out adds another L. So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many Ls? Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) parts.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions.\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then each time we go out a layer, it's (1 + 3(...)), so let's count:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3(...))\nLayer 3: (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: because the expression ends with 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears:\n\nLooking at the expression, each time after a 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)):\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of 3(...):\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is L1.\n2. Inside that, another 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is L2.\n3. This continues until the innermost 3, which is followed by (1 + 3), which is L9.\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each corresponding to L1 to L9.\n\nTherefore, my earlier calculation was correct, with L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, L4 = 121, L5 = 364, L6 = 1093, L7 = 3280, L8 = 9841, L9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 64*3=192, so total 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so total 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3.\n\nCompute 29524*3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nAdd them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming and prone to error, especially with 9 layers.\n\nLet me think: each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have L9, let's compute L9 using this formula.\n\nL9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute this again:\n\n29524*3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute 29524*3 directly:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n= 88572.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, used two methods: iterative computation and finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

It looks like a series of multiplications and additions, each nested inside the previous one. I think the way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. The expression is built up with multiple layers, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer wraps around that, adding 1 and multiplying by 3 again. There are nine layers in total because I can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 and see that there are nine of them.\n\nWait, let me check that again.

Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nStarting with L1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2: 3*(L1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, because each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, let's correct that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as each layer being 3*(1 + the result of the inner layer). So, let's define it step by step.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nStart with L1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, let's clarify:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nL3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nL6: 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nL8: 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nL9: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but wait a second, that seems like a lot, but let me check each step again because I might have made a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). Let me count how many times we do this.\n\nLet me list the layers as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, so the outermost layer is Layer9, which is 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nBut let me check if that's correct. Let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting with Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I'm miscounting the number of layers. Let me count the number of 3*(...) expressions.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach 3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time we have a 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many times 3*(1 + ... occurs.\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n9. 3*(1 + 3)\n\nSo, there are nine layers, each starting with 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the process I did above with nine layers is correct. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a different approach, perhaps looking for a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to manually compute each layer. Maybe there's a geometric series or something similar here.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous result). Let me denote the result after n layers as a_n. Then, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but wait, actually, starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, as before.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's write it as:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWe can expand this:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 3\n\n-2*C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nWe can determine A using the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A\n\nWhich is 11/2 = 3A\n\nThus, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify this:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can factor out 1/2:\n\na_n = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2 = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nNow, since we have n=9 layers, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, 3^9 = 19683\n\nNow, compute 11*19683:\n\n11*19683 = let's compute 10*19683 + 1*19683 = 196830 + 19683 = 216513\n\nThen, subtract 9: 216513 - 9 = 216504\n\nNow, divide by 6: 216504 / 6\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n216504 \u00f7 6:\n\n6 goes into 21 three times (3*6=18), remainder 3.\n\nBring down 6: 36. 6 goes into 36 six times.\n\nBring down 5: 5. 6 goes into 5 zero times, with remainder 5.\n\nBring down 0: 50. 6 goes into 50 eight times (8*6=48), remainder 2.\n\nBring down 4: 24. 6 goes into 24 four times.\n\nSo, the result is 36084.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36084, which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me confirm with another approach. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nWait, in the recurrence a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can unroll it:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\na_{n} = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this, we get:\n\na_n = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n + 3^{n+1}*a_0\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which would correspond to a_0 being something. Wait, maybe it's better to express the sum as a geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, since we have a closed-form formula already, and it's giving us 36084, which matches our step-by-step computation, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, and then verifying with a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 36084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\), where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost and \\( L_9 \\) is the outermost.\n\n1. **Innermost layer (\\( L_1 \\))**:\n   \\[ L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. **Next layer (\\( L_2 \\))**:\n   \\[ L_2 = 3 \\times (1 + L_1) = 3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\]\n\n3. **Next layer (\\( L_3 \\))**:\n   \\[ L_3 = 3 \\times (1 + L_2) = 3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\]\n\n4. **Next layer (\\( L_4 \\))**:\n   \\[ L_4 = 3 \\times (1 + L_3) = 3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147 \\]\n\n5. **Next layer (\\( L_5 \\))**:\n   \\[ L_5 = 3 \\times (1 + L_4) = 3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444 \\]\n\n6. **Next layer (\\( L_6 \\))**:\n   \\[ L_6 = 3 \\times (1 + L_5) = 3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335 \\]\n\n7. **Next layer (\\( L_7 \\))**:\n   \\[ L_7 = 3 \\times (1 + L_6) = 3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008 \\]\n\n8. **Next layer (\\( L_8 \\))**:\n   \\[ L_8 = 3 \\times (1 + L_7) = 3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027 \\]\n\n9. **Outermost layer (\\( L_9 \\))**:\n   \\[ L_9 = 3 \\times (1 + L_8) = 3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

It seems like each level adds another 1 plus 3 times the next level. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me write this down step by step. Let's denote each part as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- Level 1: 1 + 3\n- Level 2: 1 + 3(Level 1)\n- Level 3: 1 + 3(Level 2)\n- And so on, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent level wraps another 1 + 3 around that. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 is nested. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nAnd this goes on until there are nine levels, right? Because each opening parenthesis adds another level, and there are nine sets of parentheses after the first 1 + 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of closing parentheses. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to a level. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, it's multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). The innermost part is 1 + 3, and each step out adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3 terms.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\nWait, actually, maybe I miscounted. Let me try to count the number of times 1 + 3 is nested. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3 times the previous expression.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote E_n as the expression at level n.\n\nSo, E_1 = 1 + 3\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2\n\n...\n\nAnd this goes on until E_9, since there are nine levels of nesting before the outermost 3 multiplies it.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(E_9). So, the total expression is 3*E_9, where E_9 is the result after nine levels of nesting.\n\nSo, my plan is to compute E_1, then E_2, up to E_9, and then multiply the final result by 3.\n\nLet me start computing each level step by step.\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E_9, so:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the number is 88,572.\n\nWait, but 29,524 * 3: Let me compute it another way to confirm.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.

Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each level step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLooking at the expression, each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nE_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n\n-2*A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nE_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C\n\n9/2 = 3*C\n\nC = (9/2) / 3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nE_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nE_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nE_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nE_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nE_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nE_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\nE_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\nE_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\nE_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\nE_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9:\n\nE_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly.\n\nSo, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\n3*E_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2\n\nFor n=9:\n\n3*E_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177,147\n\nThus, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144 / 2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding it step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level of the expression follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous level)}\\). By iteratively computing each level and then multiplying the final result by 3, we find the solution.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Innermost Level (Level 1):**\n   \\[\n   E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Level 2:**\n   \\[\n   E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times E_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Level 3:**\n   \\[\n   E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Level 4:**\n   \\[\n   E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Level 5:**\n   \\[\n   E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Level 6:**\n   \\[\n   E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Level 7:**\n   \\[\n   E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Level 8:**\n   \\[\n   E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Level 9:**\n   \\[\n   E_9 = 1 + 3 \\times E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times E_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, but it's done multiple times. Maybe I can simplify this by working from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. The innermost parentheses are the last one, which is (1 + 3). So, I'll compute that first.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next parentheses is (1 + 3(...)).

Hmm, I need to clarify that.\n\nWait, let me parse the structure more carefully. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)).

It seems like each part is a 1 plus 3 times something, and then multiplied by 3 again. Maybe I can work my way up starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Starting with the innermost part, which is (1+3). That should be easy.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So that would be:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so now that layer simplifies to 13. Moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let me keep going.\n\n4.

(1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, that can't be right because the original expression has 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, but each time it's 3*(1+3*(...)). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it step by step, writing down each layer as I go.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, that seems like a lot.

Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, so the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by a sum that has 8 layers inside it. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me see.\n\nWait, the original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each time another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see: each time we have a new layer, we add another 3*(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...), then each subsequent 1+3( adds another layer.\n\nSo, the first one is 3(1+3(...), then inside that, another 1+3(...), and so on.\n\nLet me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n\nWait, actually, each time we have a 1+3(, that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"1+3(\" inside each other.\n\nLet me try to count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is the innermost expression.\n\nSo, to compute this, I need to compute L9 first, then L8, up to L1, and then multiply by 3.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1 to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's the opposite. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, if L1 is the innermost, then each subsequent layer is built on top of the previous one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to number them starting from the innermost as L1, then L2, L3, up to L9 as the outermost.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but looking back at the original problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, yes, if we define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, starting from the innermost, then the outermost expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each layer:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute 3*4: 12\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, L2 = 13\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, L3 = 40\n\nMoving on to L4:\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute 3*40: 120\n\nThen, 1 + 120 = 121\n\nSo, L4 = 121\n\nNext, L5:\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121: Let's see, 120*3=360, plus 1*3=3, so 363\n\nThen, 1 + 363 = 364\n\nSo, L5 = 364\n\nNow, L6:\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, +12=1092\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nSo, L6 = 1093\n\nNext, L7:\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093:\n\nLet me compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9\n\nSo, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nSo, L7 = 3280\n\nMoving on to L8:\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280:\n\n3000*3=9000, 280*3=840\n\nSo, 9000 + 840 = 9840\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nSo, L8 = 9841\n\nNow, L9:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\nLet me compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3\n\nSo, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, L9 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the result of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can notice a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for it.\n\nThe general form is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L(n) = A*3^n\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for L9, n=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent as well.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result of the previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply \\( L_9 \\) by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThe result is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, it's best to start from the innermost parentheses and work your way outwards. So, I'll start by identifying the innermost part of this expression.\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, but they're all nested within each other. So, the innermost part is the last \"1+3\". Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3\n\nLet me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So, that simplifies the innermost part. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, the expression is built as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, so perhaps I should approach this step by step, starting from the innermost and working my way out. Let me try to outline each step.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count how many times 3 is multiplied. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 3*(...). So, let's break it down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer, we have:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, let me check again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me confirm the structure. The outermost layer is 3*(...). The innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because I see nine sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each time there's a (1+3(...)), so each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied: starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. So, the number of layers is 9 because after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to number them from inside out. Let me try again, this time more carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThat's layer 2.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the number of layers earlier because the initial expression is 3*(1+3*(...)) and each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, perhaps I have 9 layers inside, but when I started, I considered Layer 1 as 1+3, which is correct, then Layer 2 as 1+3*(Layer1), etc., up to Layer9, which is 1+3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that's correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me recount the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n\nThen each time, there's a new (1+3(...)). Let me count how many times the pattern (1+3(...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( is part of a new layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. First ( after 3: start of first inner expression.\n\nThen, each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, each time, it's a new multiplication by 3. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...) in the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of (1+3(...) as follows:\n\nEach (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each time we have another (1+3(...)). Let me count how many times (1+3 occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. The first ( after 3 is the start of the first inner expression.\n\nThen, each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nSo, how many ( are there after the initial 3? Let me count:\n\nAfter 3, the expression is:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first ( is at position 1, then each subsequent ( is another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times 3 is a multiplier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each layer adds a multiplication by 3, so the number of layers is 9 because each time we have a 3 multiplied by the inner expression.\n\nWait, but when I did the earlier calculation, I ended up with 3*(Layer9) = 88572, which seems correct, but let me check with a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find a formula for a_n in terms of n.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition:\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B.\n\nWe can find another condition by looking at the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, substituting into the general solution:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, LHS: A*3^{n} + B = RHS: 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition:\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4 = 3A + B = 3A - 1/2\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a different approach to be absolutely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the expression can be represented as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nWait, considering that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write a_n as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2})\n\n= 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this way, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^{n-1}*a_1\n\nBut a_1 is 4, so:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n}*4\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Wait, perhaps it's better to see that a_n is a sum of 1's multiplied by powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then we can expand it as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nSimilarly, a_n = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*(1 + 3*a_{n-3}) = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*a_{n-3}\n\nContinuing this way, after expanding n times, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + ... + 3^{n-1}*1 + 3^{n} * a_0\n\nBut wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1 = 4. So, perhaps a_0 would be 1, since a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4.\n\nTherefore, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^{n} * a_0\n\nBut a_0 = 1, so:\n\na_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^{n} * 1\n\nThe sum sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k is a geometric series with first term 1, ratio 3, and n terms. The sum is (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + 3^{n} = (3^{n} - 1 + 2*3^{n})/2 = (3^{n} + 2*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWhich matches the earlier formula I found.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check using another method, like adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step, verifying with a geometric series approach, and double-checking the multiplication, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

It looks like a series of 1s and 3s multiplied together. Let me see if I can tackle this step by step. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the very last (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3(...)). Since we just computed the innermost part, let's substitute that in.\n\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 1)).\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me check. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times the next layer).\n\nWait, maybe I should number the layers to keep track. Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It's 9 opening parentheses, so there are 9 layers. Each layer is a (1 + 3*(...)) expression.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is layer 9, and working out to layer 1.\n\nLet me write this down step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1 to L9, where L9 is the innermost.\n\nBut wait, actually, when I'm working from the inside out, I should start with the innermost, which is the last one. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3). Let's compute that:\n\nL9: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, L8 is 3*(1 + L9). Wait, no, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer's result).\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost and moving outward, each time computing the value of each layer.\n\nWait, let me try again. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the outermost layer and L9 is the innermost. Wait, no, that might be confusing. Alternatively, maybe I should define L1 as the innermost and work outwards to L9 as the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each layer as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nSo, innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving outward, the next layer is (1 + 3*(innermost result)). So, that would be (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, L1: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, but actually, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me parse the expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as follows:\n\nLet me define the innermost as the first step, then each step builds on that.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: Now, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result from step 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Next layer out: 3*(1 + result from step 2) = 3*(1 + 13) = 3*14 = 42.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer's result). Wait, perhaps I should clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(1 + inner result). Let me try again.\n\nLet me list the layers from innermost to outermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(1 + next inner layer). So, perhaps I should compute each layer as 3*(1 + next inner layer).\n\nWait, let me try to structure this properly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but wait, no, because each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me try to write it step by step.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: Compute 3*(1 + Step1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nStep 3: Compute 3*(1 + Step2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nStep 4: Compute 3*(1 + Step3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nStep 5: Compute 3*(1 + Step4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nStep 6: Compute 3*(1 + Step5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nStep 7: Compute 3*(1 + Step6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nStep 8: Compute 3*(1 + Step7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nStep 9: Compute 3*(1 + Step8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check how many steps I have here. The original expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is step1, then step2, up to step9.\n\nWait, but in my previous steps, I only went up to step9, but let me confirm the count.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1 + ...):\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \u2192 9 layers.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first step, and then each step adds another layer.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I had 9 steps, which would correspond to 9 layers. So, perhaps I did that correctly.\n\nBut let me check each step again, perhaps I made a miscalculation in one of the steps.\n\nLet me go through each step carefully:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nStep 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nStep 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nStep 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nStep 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nStep 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nStep 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nStep 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the final result would be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 steps. Let me count the number of times I applied 3*(1 + ...). From step1 to step9, that's 9 applications, so that should correspond to the 9 layers in the original problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as each layer being a step, so starting from the innermost, which is the first step, and each subsequent step adds another layer outward.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3*(1 + previous result), starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nSo, each step is:\n\nresult = 3*(1 + previous_result)\n\nSo, step1: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12? Wait, no, that's not matching my earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to re-express the problem.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times the next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps I should compute each layer as 3*(1 + inner_value).\n\nWait, but in that case, each step is 3*(1 + inner_value). So, let me try that approach.\n\nLet me list each layer as follows:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nSo, after computing each layer from 1 to 9, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\n1. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nYes, that seems consistent each time. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, especially since each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous result). Maybe we can find a recursive formula or even a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 4, as computed earlier.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15,\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48,\n\nand so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nWe can write this as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 3,\n\n-2*C = 3,\n\nC = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but a_1 corresponds to n=1, so:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2),\n\n4 = 3*A - 3/2,\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3*A,\n\nWhich is 11/2 = 3*A,\n\nSo, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nWe can factor out 1/2:\n\na_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11*3^n)/6,\n\nand 3/2 = 9/6,\n\nso,\n\na_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6.\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (11*243 - 9)/6 = (2673 - 9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (11*729 - 9)/6 = (8019 - 9)/6 = 8010/6 = 1335. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (11*2187 - 9)/6 = (24057 - 9)/6 = 24048/6 = 4008. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (11*6561 - 9)/6 = (72171 - 9)/6 = 72162/6 = 12027. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\na_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216513 - 9)/6 = 216504/6 = 36084. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each step. Therefore, the final result after 9 layers is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem has 9 layers, we can compute a_9 using the formula:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3,\n\n3^2 = 9,\n\n3^3 = 27,\n\n3^4 = 81,\n\n3^5 = 243,\n\n3^6 = 729,\n\n3^7 = 2187,\n\n3^8 = 6561,\n\n3^9 = 19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n11 * 19683:\n\nCompute 10*19683 = 196830,\n\nPlus 1*19683 = 19683,\n\nTotal = 196830 + 19683 = 216513.\n\nThen, 216513 - 9 = 216504.\n\nDivide by 6: 216504 / 6 = 36084.\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, the final answer is 36084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by computing the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\\).\n5. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\\).\n6. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\\).\n7. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\\).\n8. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\\).\n9. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\\).\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

It seems like there are multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can solve this by starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's the first layer.\n2. Then, moving out, it's 3 times that result plus 1. So, 3*(previous result) + 1. That's the second layer.\n3. Each time I move out one layer, it's another 3*(previous result) + 1.\n\nI think there are nine layers in total because the expression starts with 3(1 + 3(...)) and there are nine sets of parentheses before it gets to the innermost (1 + 3). Let me check that again.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by another expression), and this pattern repeats. So starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(4) + 1 = 13? Wait, no, hold on. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So maybe I should think of it as each step is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nLet me try to write this step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo,\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, since there are 9 layers.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, no, let me check. The entire expression is 3*(...), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So each layer is 1 + 3*something, and each layer is built upon the previous one.\n\nSo, let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me compute that. 3*29524. Let me do 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20*3 = 60, so 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4*3 = 12, so 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, but wait a second, 29524*3. Let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo that's 88572. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the layers correctly. Because I might have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, starting from the innermost, each time I compute a new layer, I'm moving outward. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So how many times do we apply this 1 + 3*...?\n\nLet me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3)\n\nThen each time, it's 3*(previous) +1, so that's one layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" before the innermost (1 + 3). There are 8 such instances before the innermost one, so including that, it's 9 layers.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. The expression is 3(1 + 3(...)). The innermost is (1 + 3). So each time you go out a layer, you have another 1 + 3*(...). So starting from the innermost, how many layers do we have?\n\nLet me write the expression with indices:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers, ending at Layer9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed a layer. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I compute Layer1 as (1 + 3) = 4, that's the innermost. Then Layer2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to Layer9. So that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I compute each layer, I'm adding 1 and then multiplying by 3 in the next layer. Wait, no, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is built upon the previous one correctly.\n\nLet me verify the calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are getting large quickly. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer step by step, just to verify.\n\nI notice that each layer is defined by a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me confirm 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which is correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at the entire expression. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, it's a geometric series in some way, but since each term is nested, it's a bit more complex.\n\nBut since I've already computed it using both step-by-step layering and the recurrence relation, and both give me the same result, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by breaking down the nested expression from the innermost layer and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost. Each layer is computed as \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The entire expression is \\( 3 \\cdot a_9 \\):\n   - \\( 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It looks like there are nine sets of parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. I think the way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to visualize this structure. Each time, we have 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, right? Let me write this down step by step.\n\nLet's denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, and so on, starting from the innermost.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Level 2 would be 1 + 3*(Level 1). So that's 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm getting this right. Each level is 1 + 3*(previous level).

Let me count them again to be sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3)\n\nThen each subsequent level adds another (1 + 3(...)), so that's nine times. So, when I computed up to Level 9, that should be the innermost part, but actually, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Level 9, which is 29524, then the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. Wait, no, that's not correct because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the levels. Let me try to parse the expression properly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). Then each time, we go outward, adding another 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so each level adds another set. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each time we go out, we have 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), that's one level.\n\nThen each time we go out, we add another 3*(...). So, the number of levels is nine. Because each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a level, and the initial 3 outside is the 10th operation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the levels. Let me try to think differently. Let me represent the expression as:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * ... )))\n\nwith nine sets of (1 + 3*...). So, each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Level 1: 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9, which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought Level 9 was the innermost, but actually, the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is the nine-level expression. So, perhaps I'm missing one more step.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let me number the levels correctly.\n\nIf the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, that's Level 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each level adds another 3*(Level n-1) + 1.\n\nSo, Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after Level 9, which is the innermost expression, the entire problem is 3 multiplied by Level 9.\n\nWait, but no. Let me look again at the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, which is Level 1.\n\nThen, each time we move outward, we add another 3*(Level n-1) + 1.\n\nSo, after Level 9, which is the innermost, the next step is to compute 3*(Level 9). Wait, no, because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is the nine-level expression. So, in other words, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, Level 9 was 29524, so 3*29524 would be the final result.\n\nWait, but let me check: the original expression is 3*(...), where ... is the expression with nine levels. So, after computing up to Level 9, which is 29524, then the total is 3*29524.\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, perhaps the total number of levels is nine, and then the outermost 3 is applied to that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute each level step by step, making sure I don't miss any.\n\nLet me write down each level:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9, which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check the original expression again. It starts with 3*(...), where the ... is the nested expression with nine levels. So, yes, after computing the innermost expression up to Level 9 as 29524, then the total is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n3*4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n3*2=6 +1=7.\n\n3*5=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n3*9=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n3*2=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the number is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me verify each level again:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400=29,400 +120=29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 29,524*3 again.\n\n29,524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, 88,572. Correct.\n\nOkay, so after carefully computing each level step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses (Level 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Level 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Level 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Level 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Level 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Level 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Level 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Level 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Level 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It looks like a series of 1s and 3s multiplied together with addition. I think this is an example of a nested expression where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). So, maybe I can simplify this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by the result of the previous parentheses. So, it's like a chain of operations. I think the way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, calculating each layer one by one.\n\nLet me write down the expression with labels for each layer to keep track. I'll number the innermost parentheses as Layer 1 and go up to Layer 9 since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count the number of parentheses to make sure. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer, and each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a step.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of each \"1 + 3(...)\" as a node, and each node is multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is just (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, actually, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me check that.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, moving outward, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), but that's not correct because each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write it out step by step, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression from the inside out. So, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nFirst, let's define each step as a function of the previous step. Let me denote each step as S_n, where n is the step number, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, S_2 = 3*(1 + S_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps S_1 is (1 + 3) = 4, then S_2 is 3*(1 + 3*S_1). Wait, no, that might not be correct because each time, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps each step is 3*(1 + previous step).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to write it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, calculating each layer as I go.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Wait, no, in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps each step is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of each \"1 + 3(...)\" as a term, and each time, it's multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving outward, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(4)). Wait, but that would be 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Wait, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by expanding each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out: 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, but hold on, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so if the innermost is 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\n3. Next layer out: 3*(1 + 3*(39)) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nWait, that seems like a big jump. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4.\n\nThen, next layer: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nThen, next layer: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nThen, next layer: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nWait, this seems to be increasing rapidly. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me count the number of times \"3(\" appears in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first term is 3, then inside, it's (1 + 3(...)), so each time, it's 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(...):\n\n- The first 3*(...)\n- Then inside that, another 3*(...)\n- And so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent layer is another 3(, until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- The first 3( is layer 1\n- Inside that, another 3( is layer 2\n- Continuing, up to layer 9, because the innermost is (1+3), which is layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 3( in the expression:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, each subsequent layer is another 3(, so:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of 3*(...). Therefore, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from the innermost (1+3)=4.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*Layer1) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*Layer2) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*Layer3) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*Layer4) = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*Layer5) = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*Layer6) = 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*Layer7) = 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*Layer8) = 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404.\n\nWait, so according to this, the final result is 188,329,404. Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go through each layer step by step again, more carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404. Correct.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent. Each layer is correctly calculated by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, then multiplying by 3 again. Hmm, but maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, perhaps a geometric series or something similar, which might allow me to compute this without calculating each layer step by step.\n\nWait, let me think about it. Each layer seems to be following the recurrence relation S_n = 3*(1 + 3*S_{n-1}).\n\nWait, so S_n = 3*(1 + 3*S_{n-1}) = 3 + 9*S_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for S_n.\n\nLet me try to model this recurrence. The recurrence is S_n = 9*S_{n-1} + 3, with S_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is S_n - 9*S_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 9 = 0, so r = 9. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is S_h(n) = A*9^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say S_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 9*C + 3.\n\nSolving for C: C - 9C = 3 => -8C = 3 => C = -3/8.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is S(n) = S_h(n) + S_p(n) = A*9^n - 3/8.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, S(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*9^1 - 3/8 => 4 = 9A - 3/8.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n9A = 4 + 3/8 = 32/8 + 3/8 = 35/8\n\nA = (35/8) / 9 = 35/(8*9) = 35/72.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is S(n) = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8.\n\nSimplify this:\n\nS(n) = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8.\n\nWe can write 9^n as 9*9^{n-1}, but perhaps it's better to compute it directly for n=9.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nSo, S(9) = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8.\n\nWait, that seems complicated, but let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 9^9.\n\nCompute 9^1 = 9\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n9^3 = 729\n\n9^4 = 6561\n\n9^5 = 59049\n\n9^6 = 531441\n\n9^7 = 4782969\n\n9^8 = 43046721\n\n9^9 = 387420489\n\nSo, 9^9 = 387,420,489.\n\nNow, compute (35/72)*387,420,489.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 35/72 is approximately 0.486111...\n\nBut let's compute it exactly.\n\nCompute 35 * 387,420,489 = ?\n\nWell, 35 * 387,420,489.\n\nLet me compute 387,420,489 * 35.\n\nFirst, 387,420,489 * 30 = 11,622,614,670\n\nThen, 387,420,489 * 5 = 1,937,102,445\n\nAdding them together: 11,622,614,670 + 1,937,102,445 = 13,559,717,115.\n\nSo, 35 * 387,420,489 = 13,559,717,115.\n\nNow, divide this by 72:\n\n13,559,717,115 \u00f7 72.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n72 * 188,329,404 = ?\n\nWait, because earlier, when I computed step by step, I got 188,329,404 as the result for Layer 9. So, perhaps this is correct.\n\nBut let me check:\n\n72 * 188,329,404.\n\nCompute 188,329,404 * 70 = 13,183,058,280\n\nCompute 188,329,404 * 2 = 376,658,808\n\nAdd them together: 13,183,058,280 + 376,658,808 = 13,559,717,088.\n\nWait, but 72 * 188,329,404 = 13,559,717,088.\n\nBut our numerator is 13,559,717,115, which is 27 more.\n\nSo, 13,559,717,115 - 13,559,717,088 = 27.\n\nTherefore, 13,559,717,115 \u00f7 72 = 188,329,404 + 27/72 = 188,329,404 + 3/8 = 188,329,404.375.\n\nWait, so S(9) = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8 = 188,329,404.375 - 0.375 = 188,329,404.\n\nSo, that matches the step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but in the step-by-step calculation, Layer 9 was 188,329,404, which matches the general solution. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the general solution approach, let me verify the recurrence relation again.\n\nWe had S_n = 3*(1 + 3*S_{n-1}) = 3 + 9*S_{n-1}.\n\nSo, S_n = 9*S_{n-1} + 3.\n\nWith S_1 = 4.\n\nWe found the homogeneous solution as S_h(n) = A*9^n.\n\nParticular solution S_p = C, where C = -3/8.\n\nThus, S(n) = A*9^n - 3/8.\n\nUsing S(1) = 4: 4 = A*9 - 3/8 => 9A = 4 + 3/8 = 35/8 => A = 35/(8*9) = 35/72.\n\nTherefore, S(n) = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8.\n\nFor n=9, S(9) = (35/72)*387,420,489 - 3/8.\n\nWe computed that as 188,329,404, which matches the step-by-step approach.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{188329404}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure this out. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions like this.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3):\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). Let me write that down.\n\n2. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 1)):\n   - Here, the result from step 1 is 4, so it's 1 + 3*4\n   - 3*4 = 12\n   - 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, hold on, actually, looking back at the original problem, it's 3 multiplied by each of these expressions. So, each step is 3*(1 + something). Maybe I need to adjust my approach.\n\nLet me parse the expression more carefully. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by a series of nested (1 + 3*(...)) terms. So, perhaps each level is 3*(1 + 3*(next level)). Let me try to break it down step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me number each level from 1 to 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me count: starting from the innermost, there are nine (1+3) expressions. Let me confirm:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is level 1, then each subsequent level adds another 3*(...). So, let me compute each level step by step.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm numbering these levels correctly. The innermost is (1+3)=4, which is level 1. Then, moving out, the next expression is 3*(1 + level1). So, Level 2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Then Level 3 is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on, up to Level 9, which would be the outermost expression, right?\n\nBut looking back at the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the last set of parentheses, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, if I count the number of 3*(1 + ...), it's 8 layers, because the innermost is just (1+3). Let me count the number of 3s outside each parentheses.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4, then each step is 3*(1 + previous result). Let me see how many times this happens.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nStart with a = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, next layer: b = 1 + 3*a\n\nThen, next layer: c = 1 + 3*b\n\nAnd so on, until we have 9 layers? Wait, no. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Starting from the innermost, each time we have a 3 multiplied by (1 + something). Let me count the number of these.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3*(1 + ...). Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, (1+3), then moving out, we have 3*(1 + (1+3)), then 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1+3))), and so on.\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Starting from the innermost, each time we move out, we add another 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1+3), then the next is 3*(1 + (1+3)), then 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1+3))), and so on.\n\nSo, the total number of layers is 9, because the innermost is (1+3), and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...), up to 8 more layers. So, in total, 9 layers? Wait, no, because the innermost is just (1+3), and then each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from layer 1: (1+3)=4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...), which is layer9 as above. So, the total value is 36084.\n\nBut let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step, I add 1 to the previous result, then multiply by 3. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, after 8 multiplications, we get to the outermost layer, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is 4, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...):\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)=4\n\n2. Next: 3*(1 + 4)=15\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15)=48\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48)=147\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147)=444\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444)=1335\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335)=4008\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008)=12027\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027)=36084\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers in total, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check the arithmetic again for each step, just to be sure.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, the final answer should be 36084.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach makes sense.\n\nEach layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous). So, let's denote a_n as the value at each layer.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nWait, no, wait, that's not right. Because in the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + previous), not 1 + 3*previous. Wait, no, actually, in the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + something). So, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nLet me define a_n as the value at each layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, a_9 is the final result, which is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, can I find a formula for a_n? Let's see.\n\nWe have a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + C\n\nWhere A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the particular solution. Assume a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 3 => -2*C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nHmm, that seems fractional, but let's proceed.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3*A - 1.5\n\nAdding 1.5 to both sides:\n\n5.5 = 3*A => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 \u2248 1.833...\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can factor out 1/6:\n\na_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\nSo, 3^9=19683\n\nThus,\n\na_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n11*19683 = 19683*10 + 19683 = 196830 + 19683 = 216,513\n\nThen subtract 9:\n\n216,513 - 9 = 216,504\n\nNow divide by 6:\n\n216,504 / 6 = 36,084\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084, which matches our earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n\nI think that's solid. Both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous result). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the expression is 36,084.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying by 3 and adding 1:\n   - Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n   - Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n   - Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n   - Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n   - Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n   - Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n   - Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n   - Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

I think I should start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. \n\nAlright, let me rewrite this expression to make it clearer. So, the expression is 3 multiplied by a series of (1 + 3(...)), and there are nine sets of parentheses here. That's a lot, but maybe I can compute each one step by step. Let me see if I can break it down:\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next part is 3 multiplied by that result, right? Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is 3(1 + 3(...)). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps I should approach it by starting from the innermost and moving outward, each time evaluating the innermost expression first.\n\nLet me try to structure this.

Let me try to write down each step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out one level, we have:\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this Level 9 result. So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, compute 3*29000 = 87000\n\nThen, 3*524 = 1572\n\nSo, adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in one of the levels. Let me go back step by step.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7\n\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nLet me verify each level:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems right. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula here. Each step is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, let me see:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let me see. Each step is a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant.\n\nLet me find B. When n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate, but since our series is finite, maybe it's better to solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier result. So, using the formula, I also get 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated step by step by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each level simplifies according to the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). After computing each level up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Level 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Level 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Level 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Level 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Level 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Level 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Level 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Level 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Level 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. Multiply the result by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

It looks like there are nine sets of parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Hmm, maybe I can solve this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count the number of parentheses. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another set of (1 + 3(...)). Let me see, from the inside out, how many layers there are.\n\nWait, actually, let me check how many times 3 is multiplied. Let me count the number of 3s that are being multiplied in each term. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 3. Then each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the result of the next inner expression. Hmm, maybe I can represent this as a recursive expression or find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*(first layer) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, let me write this down step by step:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, up to L9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so maybe L9 is multiplied by 3 at the end. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So, actually, there are nine layers of (1 + 3*something), each nested inside the previous one, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3. Wait, no, actually, the outermost is 3*(...), so maybe the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and this is done nine times, and then the whole thing is multiplied by 3. Wait, but in the problem, the outermost is 3*(...), so perhaps the innermost is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), and this is done nine times, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, let me count the number of 3s in the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times we have the (1 + 3(...)) structure. Let me try to parse the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, but hold on, in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so perhaps after computing up to Layer 9, we then multiply by 3. Hmm, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, let me write down the expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nThe innermost parentheses are (1 + 3), which is 4. Let's call this Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Let's call this Layer 2.\n\nThen, Layer 3 is (1 + 3*Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original problem, after the innermost (1 + 3), each layer is 1 + 3*(...), and this is done nine times. So, after Layer 9, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So, after computing the innermost nine layers, which gives 29524, then we multiply by 3, giving 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's Layer 1, then each additional (1 + 3(...)) adds a layer. Let's count them.\n\nFrom the innermost, the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)) is nine. So, Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, alternatively, 29,524 * 3:\n\n3*20,000 = 60,000\n\n3*9,000 = 27,000\n\n3*500 = 1,500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this multiplication step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29,524\n\u00d7        3\n---------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9.

So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29,524, and then we multiply by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication again. Maybe I should compute 29,524 \u00d7 3 differently.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet's break it down as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24) \u00d7 3\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500\n\n24 \u00d7 3 = 72\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 29,524 \u00d7 3 using standard multiplication:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before, so I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute Layer 9 again, in case I made a mistake in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the original problem indeed has nine layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let me count the number of times \"3(\" appears:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each \"3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's nine \"3(\" instances. So, that would mean nine layers, right? So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), up to nine layers, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I considered nine layers, each being (1 + 3*previous_layer), and then multiplied the ninth layer by 3. So, that should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1: 4\n\nThen, each layer is 1 + 3*Layer_i, where i is the previous layer.\n\nSo, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to see if I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, just to confirm.\n\nThis seems like a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, let's see if we can find a general formula for the nth layer.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value at the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\nL_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWe can find A and B using initial conditions.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\n\nGood, so the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2,187\n\n3^8 = 6,561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, L_9 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\nSo, that confirms the result using a formula approach. That makes me more confident that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2,187\n\n3^8 = 6,561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed until the ninth layer is reached. This value is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Result:**\n    Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to tackle it from the inside out. I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, it's best to start from the innermost parentheses and work your way outward. So, I'll start by identifying the innermost part of this expression.\n\nLooking at it, the innermost part is the last \"1+3\". Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next part would be 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, the expression is 1 + 3*(something). So, after the innermost 1+3, the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). Let me make sure I'm getting this right.\n\nLet me write out the entire expression with each layer:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3. Let's compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one step out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So, that would be:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Wait, maybe I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3\" appears. It looks like there are nine layers of 1+3 multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a 1+3, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...) around it.\n\nSo, let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, but wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me check again. Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so let me try that.\n\nWait, so starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I'm correctly identifying how many layers there are. Let me count the number of \"1+3\" sections.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3, and each is wrapped in 3*(...). Let's count the number of times we have 1+3 inside the expression.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving left, we have another (1+3(...))\n3. Each time, we add another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first opening parenthesis is after the first 3, then each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, that suggests there are 9 layers of 1+3 multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and moving outwards, we have 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I went up to Layer 9 and then multiplied by 3. But in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(...), so perhaps I was correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after the first 3, we have a 1+3 followed by another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the last 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(1+3*(...)).\n\nSo, let's try to compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n----------\n88,572\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3:\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4:\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5:\n\n1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6:\n\n1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7:\n\n1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8:\n\n1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9:\n\n1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems high, but considering each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it might be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWith a_1 = 4\n\nSo, let's see if that's the case.\n\nWait, actually, starting from the innermost, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\n-2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nWait, but let me check if this approach is correct because the problem has 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = 29524, then total expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has 8 layers because I might have miscounted. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 expressions inside:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. Each time, we have another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times we have 1+3 inside the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 inside:\n\nStarting from the left, each time after a 3, there's a 1+3. Let me count the number of 1+3:\n\n1. The first 1+3 is after the first 3, so that's one.\n2. Then, inside that, another 1+3, so that's two.\n3. Continuing, each time we have another 1+3 until the innermost.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3\" is followed by another 3*(...). So, the number of \"1+3\" is equal to the number of layers, which is 9. So, n=9, so a_9=29524, then total is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm.\n\nLet me compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nCompute innermost first:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the closed-form formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nFor n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the expression in reverse, starting from the innermost and moving outward.\n\nLet me list each layer:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built using a series of 1s and 3s, all nested inside each other.

Hmm, maybe I should label each layer to keep track.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because if Layer 1 is 4, then Layer 2 would be 3*(1 + 4) = 15, correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nHmm, so according to this, the final result is 36084. But wait, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me count how many times 3 is being multiplied. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time I have 3*(1 + ...), so how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me see: The innermost is (1 + 3), then each time wrapping it with 3*(1 + ...). So starting from (1 + 3), then 3*(1 + that), and so on, nine times. So Layer 1 is (1 + 3), Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1), up to Layer 9 being the outermost.\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers, so 9 times multiplying by 3. So the result would be 3^9 times something. Wait, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + a(a + a(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed as a geometric series or using a formula. Let me think about this.\n\nIn general, if you have a term like x = a + a(x), then x = a + a*x, which can be solved as x = a/(1 - a) if |a| < 1, but in this case, a is 3, which is greater than 1, so it diverges. But in our case, we have a finite number of layers, so it's a finite nested expression, not an infinite one.\n\nSo perhaps each layer can be represented as 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me try to see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9). So, the total expression is 3*(L_9), where L_9 is 1 + 3*L_8.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, starting with L_1 = 4.\n\nThen,\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, wait, that's different from what I calculated earlier. Wait, earlier I thought L_2 was 15, but now I'm getting 13. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my initial calculation.\n\nWait, let's clarify: The innermost layer is (1 + 3) = 4, which is L_1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + L_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15, which would be L_2.\n\nWait, but if I define L_n as 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, then L_2 would be 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is different from 15. So perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me re-examine the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nWait, so each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nBut if I define it that way, then L_1 would be 3*(1 + 3) = 15, which is the second layer from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try again, perhaps starting from the innermost as L_1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + L_{n}).\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as each layer being 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let me try again.\n\nInnermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nWait, so each time, it's 3*(1 + previous result). So, if I have n layers, each time I compute 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, so let's list them step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nSo, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 36084. But wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but in my calculation above, Layer 9 is already 3*(1 + Layer 8), so the entire expression is Layer 9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, the first layer after innermost is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, the next is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on, up to the 9th layer, which would be 3*(1 + previous layer). So, the total expression is equal to the 9th layer, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I ended up with 36084 as Layer 9, which is the outermost expression. So, the value of the entire expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nSo, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 4)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, let's take another small example: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nSo, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Wait, but according to my earlier method, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 15, so the total expression would be 15, but that's not correct because the actual value is 39.\n\nWait, so perhaps my earlier approach was wrong. Let me figure this out.\n\nWait, in the small example, 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: 3*4 = 12.\n\nThen, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nSo, in this case, the total number of layers is 3: innermost is (1 + 3), then 3*(1 + 3) = 12, then 3*(1 + 12) = 39.\n\nSo, in this case, with two layers of 3*(1 + ...), the result is 39.\n\nWait, so perhaps in the original problem, with nine layers, the result is 36084, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but in the small example, if I follow the same approach as before, with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4, Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15, Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48, but the actual value is 39. So, my approach is overcounting.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial approach was wrong because I'm not correctly accounting for the number of layers.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of each 3*(1 + ...) as a separate layer, so in the small example, there are two 3*(1 + ...) layers, resulting in 39, whereas my earlier method was counting three layers, which led to an incorrect result.\n\nSo, perhaps in the original problem, the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers is eight, not nine.\n\nWait, let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...) in the original problem.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 3*(1 + ...). Let's count how many times 3*(1 + ...) occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + [result from 1])\n3. 3*(1 + [result from 2])\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nSo, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) occur? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), which is not a 3*(1 + ...). Then, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the next layer:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n2. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n3. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n4. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n5. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n6. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n7. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n8. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, that's eight layers of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the total expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but in the small example, I had two layers of 3*(1 + ...), and the result was 39, which is correct. So, in the original problem, with eight layers, the result is 36084.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I had nine layers, I ended up with 36084, but when I tested with a small example, I saw that the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers is one less than the number of parentheses. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied by something, which is one less than the number of nested parentheses. Let me think.\n\nIn the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and then each time, we have 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers is eight, because each time we have a new layer wrapping around.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to compute eight layers of 3*(1 + previous result), starting from 4.\n\nSo, let me compute that:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because in the small example, the innermost was (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer was 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nWait, so perhaps each layer after the innermost is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then Layer 1: 3*(1 + 4) = 15, Layer 2: 3*(1 + 15) = 48, up to Layer 8: 3*(1 + previous result) = 36084.\n\nWait, but in the small example, with two layers of 3*(1 + ...), we had:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 4) = 15,\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 15) = 48,\n\nBut the actual value was 39, so that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to compute the original expression step by step, layer by layer, without assigning numbers to the layers, just computing from the inside out.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nSo, after eight layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from 4, I get 36084.\n\nWait, but in the small example, with two layers after the innermost, I had:\n\nInnermost: 4,\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 4) = 15,\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 15) = 48,\n\nBut the actual value of the expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 4)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, which is correct. So, in that case, two layers after the innermost, resulting in 48.\n\nWait, but in another small example, 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4,\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 4) = 15,\n\nSo, the expression is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, but wait, that's not correct because 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39, not 48.\n\nWait, so perhaps my approach is incorrect. Wait, no, in that case, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), which is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nSo, in that case, there's only one layer after the innermost, resulting in 39.\n\nWait, so perhaps the number of layers after the innermost is equal to the number of times 3*(1 + ...) appears, which is one less than the number of nested parentheses.\n\nWait, in the original problem, how many layers of 3*(1 + ...) are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 3*(1 + ...). Let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...) terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\n2. 3*(1 + 12) = 15.\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, so that's nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). But in the small example, with two layers after the innermost, we saw that the result was 39, not 48. So, perhaps I'm overcounting again.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the initial innermost is just (1 + 3), not a 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers is one less than the number of nested parentheses.\n\nWait, in the original problem, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) appear?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, we have:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, the number of times 3*(1 + ...) appears is eight, because each time after the first, we have another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct number of layers is eight, leading to the result 36084.\n\nWait, but in the small example with two layers, I had:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39.\n\nSo, in that case, there's one layer of 3*(1 + ...), which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nWait, no, in that case, the innermost is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then the outermost is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, but that's not correct because the actual value is 39.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers again.\n\nWait, let me parse the small example again.\n\nExpression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: 3*4 = 12.\n\nThen, outermost: 3*(1 + 12) = 39.\n\nSo, in this case, there's only one layer of 3*(1 + ...), which is 3*(1 + 4) = 12, and then the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 12) = 39.\n\nSo, two layers in total: one inner 3*(1 + ...) and one outer 3*(1 + ...), but the result is 39.\n\nWait, so perhaps in the original problem, with eight layers of 3*(1 + ...), the result is 36084.\n\nWait, but in the small example, two layers of 3*(1 + ...) give 39, which is correct.\n\nWait, so perhaps in the original problem, the number of layers is eight, leading to 36084.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed nine layers, I got 36084, but in the small example, two layers give 39, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in how I'm counting the layers. Let me try to count the number of 3*(1 + ...) terms in the original problem.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many times 3*(1 + ...) appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\n2. 3*(1 + 12) = 15.\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, so that's nine layers, but in the small example, two layers give 39, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct answer is indeed 36084.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nEach time, we have a term that's 3*(1 + previous term). Let me denote the nth term as a_n.\n\nSo, a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39.\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120.\n\nWait, but that doesn't match my earlier calculation. Hmm, perhaps I'm not modeling it correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_0 = 3.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\na_0 = 3.\n\na_1 = 3*(1 + a_0) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39.\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120.\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 120) = 363.\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 363) = 1092.\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279.\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840.\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523.\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier result. So, if I model it this way, the result is 88572, but that doesn't align with my step-by-step calculation earlier. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the expression as a recurrence relation where each term is 3*(1 + previous term), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, so let me try to model it correctly.\n\nLet me define the expression starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote the innermost as E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer out is E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), not 1 + 3*previous layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused again.\n\nWait, in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nE_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nE_4 = 3*(1 + E_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nE_5 = 3*(1 + E_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nE_6 = 3*(1 + E_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nE_7 = 3*(1 + E_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nE_8 = 3*(1 + E_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nE_9 = 3*(1 + E_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is E_9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but in the small example, when I compute E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then E_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 15, then E_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 48, but the actual value of the expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) is 39, not 48. So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the small example, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 4)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, but when I compute it step by step, I get 39.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) step by step.\n\nCompute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nSo, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))).\n\nCompute the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, compute 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nThen, moving out another layer: 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nSo, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39.\n\nWait, so in this case, the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers is two, but the result is 39, which is different from my earlier calculation where I thought it was 48.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial approach was incorrect, and I should model it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps each time, the expression is 3*(1 + previous layer), but in the small example, the innermost is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39, which is correct.\n\nWait, so in that case, the number of layers is two: one innermost (1 + 3), and then one layer of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, so perhaps in the original problem, the number of layers is eight, leading to 36084.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting results when I test with small examples, so perhaps I need to find a better way to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), so let's see:\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to express E in terms of itself.\n\nBut since it's a finite nested expression, it's not straightforward to"

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested 3's and 1's. It seems like each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to see how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next layer: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nLet me count the number of 3's. Hmm, each time we add another 3(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so there are 8 layers? Let me check again. Each time I go in, there's another 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost as 1, then each next layer adds another 3(...). So yes, 8 layers in total.\n\nSo maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let's assign each layer a number from 1 to 8, where layer 1 is the innermost, and layer 8 is the outermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 8.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 as well. So the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8). So I'll need to compute Layer 8, then multiply by 3.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough.\n\nNow Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute 3*4: 12\n\nSo Layer 2: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121: 363\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: Let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8), so:\n\n3*9841\n\nCompute that: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.\n\nWait, but 9841 is 9000 + 800 + 40 + 1. So:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nNow add them up:\n\n27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculation again.\n\nWait, 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3.\n\nCompute 9*3=27, carryover 2.\n\n8*3=24 +2=26, carryover 2.\n\n4*3=12 +2=14, carryover 1.\n\n1*3=3 +1=4.\n\nWait, but that's from right to left.\n\nWait, actually, let me do it properly:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n1*3 = 3\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, write the carryover 2.\n\nSo the result is 29523.\n\nWait, but when I did it digit by digit:\n\n9841\n\n*    3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2\n\nSo we have 29523.\n\nSo yes, 3*9841=29523.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 29523.\n\nWait, let me just go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3*9841=29523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So perhaps we can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of layer n.\n\nSo L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nHmm, so each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolve for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nL_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\nL_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\nL_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\nL_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\nL_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works.\n\nSo, using this formula, L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(L_8) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3*L_8 = 3*(3^9 -1)/2 = (3^{10} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, 3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, (59049 -3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 29523.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, found a pattern, derived a formula, and confirmed the result using two methods. So I'm confident the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, eventually leading to the outermost layer. Multiplying the final result by 3 gives the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Final Multiplication by 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 9841 = 29523\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{29523}\\)."

Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each subsequent layer is 1+3*(previous layer). So, the number of layers is 9, because each time we have another 1+3*(...), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times we have 1+3 followed by a (.\n\nIn the expression, after each 1+3, there's a (, so:\n\n- 1+3(...\n- 1+3(...\n- And so on.\n\nLet me count the number of ( after each 1+3:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first ( after 1+3 is the start of layer 1, then the next ( is layer 2, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses in the entire expression. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time we have a ( after a 1+3, so the number of ( after 1+3 is 9 times, because each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so the number of layers is 9. Therefore, we have 9 layers, each being 1+3*(previous layer).\n\nWait, but in the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, which means we have 9 instances of 1+3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach it as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me start from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that again because I think I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 in the expression:\n\nEach time, it's 1+3 followed by a (, so:\n\n1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nSo, there are 9 instances of 1+3 followed by a (, which means there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to layer 9, which gave me 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I think I might have miscalculated the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nWell, 29524*3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me recast each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but given that the number of layers isn't too large, computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check Layer 7 again.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6.\n\nLayer 6 was 1093, so 3*1093=3279, plus 1 is 3280. That's correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more using a different approach to ensure I didn't make any mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote the layers as a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nGiven that, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant.\n\nTo find B, we can solve for the steady-state solution, where a_n = a_{n-1} = B.\n\nSo, B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2.\n\nBut since our terms are all positive, this suggests that the homogeneous solution will dominate.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n.\n\nTo find A, we can use the initial condition. At n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nFor n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the general formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my step-by-step calculation was correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost outwards, resulting in a total value of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It seems like a recursive expression where each layer has a similar structure. Let me try to break it down from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nStarting from the very inside, the innermost part is 1+3. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost parentheses simplify to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure. The expression is 1 + 3(something). So the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me write this step by step.\n\nLet me number each layer for clarity. Let's say there are nine layers since I see nine sets of parentheses. Starting from the innermost as layer 1, moving outwards to layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating 3*13: 3*10 is 30, 3*3 is 9, so 30+9=39. Then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nHmm, 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCalculating 3*364. Let's break it down: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCalculating 3*1093. Let me think: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCalculating 3*3280. Let's see: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. Adding them: 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCalculating 3*9841. Hmm, let's break it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that. I think I might have miscounted the layers because the original expression starts with 3(1+3(...)), so perhaps I need to multiply the entire expression by 3 after the last layer. Let me double-check how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. and so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me recount. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. Each time it's 1+3(...), so let's count the number of times we have \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many layers of multiplication by 3 there are. Each layer adds a 3 multiplied by the previous result. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so a_9 is 29524. But the original expression is 3 times a_9. Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me check the structure again.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(a_9). Because each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, starting from a_1 up to a_9, and then the outermost 3 is multiplied by a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to a_9, which is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(a_9), right? Because the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(a_9).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I computed a_9 as 29524, so then the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's compute 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524 = 1572. So adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had a_9 as 29524, which is after the innermost layers. So if the entire expression is 3*(a_9), then the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the initial breakdown, I thought each layer was 1 + 3*a_n, but perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me verify.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo starting from the innermost, there are nine layers of 1+3(...), and then the outermost 3 multiplied by that.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, a_9 was 29524, which would be the result of the innermost nine layers, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo a9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo reading from top to bottom: 88,572.\n\nWait, that's 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought it was 88,572, but let me make sure.\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7         3\n----------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the final answer was 88,572, but let me make sure I didn't miss a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. Let me count how many 1+3(...) there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. Each time, it's nested inside another 1 + 3(...)\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" appear? Let me count the opening parentheses:\n\nFrom the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each 1 + 3( adds a new layer. Let's count the number of 1 + 3(:\n\n1. The first innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because after the initial 3, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the innermost is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another, so up to layer 9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had a_9 as 29524, which is after 9 layers, and then multiplied by 3, giving 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the outermost 3 is included or if I already accounted for it in a_9.\n\nWait, in my definition, a_1 is the innermost (1+3), a_2 is the next layer, up to a_9, which is the result of the ninth layer. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9, so that would be correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the outermost 3 is included in a_9? Let me check.\n\nWait, in my earlier calculation, a_9 is 1 + 3*a_8, which is the ninth layer, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So that would mean the outermost 3 is outside of all the layers, so yes, it's 3 times a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my a_9 calculation because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLet me go through each a_n again:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So a9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes I might make a mistake there.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 29524 * 3 in another way.\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the problem might have only eight layers, but according to the problem statement, it's nine layers of 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the problem again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach time, after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. After the initial 3, it's (1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then each 1 + 3( adds another layer.\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 9. Because each \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer.\n\nWait, no, actually, the number of layers is one less than the number of opening parentheses because each layer is defined by an opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let me count:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, each time we have \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3(...))\nLayer 3: (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to Layer 9.\n\nSo, yes, there are nine layers of 1 + 3(...), each nested inside the previous one. So, a_9 is the result of the ninth layer, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers.\n\nLet me try to write out the expression with each layer labeled:\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The outermost is 3*(...), and inside that is 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 8, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the outermost is 3*(Layer 8), where Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7), etc., down to Layer 1 being 1 + 3.\n\nSo, in that case, the outermost is 3*(Layer 8), and Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7), etc., so the total number of layers is 9, with Layer 1 being the innermost.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*(Layer 8), which is 3*(a8), where a8 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29,523. Wait, that's different from what I had earlier.\n\nWait, hold on, I'm getting confused now. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 8), then:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*Layer8 = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where I thought a9 was 29524. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me check again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\n2. (1 + 3*(result from step1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*(result from step2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*(result from step3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*(result from step4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*(result from step5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*(result from step6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*(result from step7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*(result from step8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(result from step9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so that would mean that the original expression has nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous), starting from 1 + 3, and then the outermost 3 multiplies the ninth layer's result.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial calculation was correct, and the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but now I'm getting confused because when I labeled the layers from 1 to 9, I thought the outermost was 3*(Layer8), but perhaps that's incorrect.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost parentheses is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each time we move outward, we add a layer.\n\nSo, the first layer is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThe second layer is (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\nThird layer: (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\nFourth layer: (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n\nFifth layer: (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n\nSixth layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1093.\n\nSeventh layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280.\n\nEighth layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841.\n\nNinth layer: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(ninth layer) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the outermost expression was 3*(Layer8), which would be 3*9841 = 29,523, but that's incorrect because the ninth layer is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier when I thought the outermost was 3*(Layer8). Let me check the structure again.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So, the innermost is Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: (1 + 3*Layer1) = 13\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*Layer2) = 40\n\nLayer4: (1 + 3*Layer3) = 121\n\nLayer5: (1 + 3*Layer4) = 364\n\nLayer6: (1 + 3*Layer5) = 1093\n\nLayer7: (1 + 3*Layer6) = 3280\n\nLayer8: (1 + 3*Layer7) = 9841\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3*Layer8) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers corresponds correctly. Each time we have a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, how many times does that happen?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the original problem:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to nine times.\n\nYes, so nine layers, leading to Layer9 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute this using a different approach, perhaps a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using a formula, especially if they form a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s say we have an expression like x = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Then, each layer can be represented recursively as x_k = 1 + 3*x_{k-1}, with x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, for each layer, x_k = 1 + 3*x_{k-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving x_k - 3*x_{k-1} = 1.\n\nWait, but actually, the recurrence is x_k = 1 + 3*x_{k-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is x_k - 3*x_{k-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is x^{(h)}_k = C*3^k.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution x^{(p)}_k = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n\n-2*A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is x_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When k=1, x_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is x_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer k, x_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for k=9, x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCalculating 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nThus, x_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation of a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, we also arrive at the same result, confirming that the final answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered both the step-by-step computation and the general formula for such nested expressions, and both lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, then multiply the final result by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Expression:**\n    Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It looks like a nested expression where each layer has 1 plus 3 times something. I think the way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That makes sense because parentheses usually indicate the order of operations, so I should handle the innermost ones first.\n\nLet me write this out step by step to visualize it better. Let's label each layer from the innermost to the outermost for clarity.\n\nStarting with the innermost part:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, since I count nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. The expression is 3 times a big parenthesis, and inside that, it's 1 plus 3 times another parenthesis, and so on. So let me count the number of times the pattern \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3(, there are 8 more instances of (1+3(...)). So that would mean there are 9 layers in total. So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9, and working up to Layer 1.\n\nLet me write this out step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 9:\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\n\nThen Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n...\nAnd so on until Layer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1)\n\nSo let's compute each layer one by one.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo reading it backwards: 8, 7, 5, 2, 2.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo 3*(Layer 1) = 88572\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 1. Let's double-check the layers.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach, like recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo a_1 = 1 + 3\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nWait, no, actually, since we start from the innermost, which is a_9, and go up to a_1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index them from a_1 to a_9, with a_1 being the innermost.\n\nSo a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n... and so on, as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for a geometric series here.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant.\n\nTo find B, we can solve for the steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = B.\n\nSo B = 1 + 3*B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, when I defined a_1 as the innermost, which is Layer 9 in the original problem, then the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the innermost expression is 1+3, which is a_1 in my previous definition, and the outermost is a_9.\n\nWait, no, let me think again.\n\nIn the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )))\n\nSo the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So if I have 9 layers, then a_1 is 1+3, a_2 is 1+3*a_1, up to a_9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, after the initial 3*(...), there are 8 more layers, so total 9 layers including the initial one. So perhaps a_1 is the innermost, and a_9 is the outermost.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had Layer 9 as 1+3, Layer 8 as 1+3*Layer9, etc., up to Layer1 as the outermost. So in that case, the outermost is Layer1, which would be a_9 in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should adjust the indices to match.\n\nLet me reindex so that the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9.\n\nSo a_1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\na_2=1+3*a1=13\n\na_3=1+3*a2=40\n\n...\n\na_9=1+3*a8\n\nSo using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the Layer1 value I computed earlier.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo this confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), leading to a geometric progression, and using the formula to find the nth term, which avoids computing each layer step by step. But since the number of layers isn't too large, computing each step is manageable.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows the use of a formula to find the nth term, confirming the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series of 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n4. **Alternative verification using a formula**: Recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, the nth term formula (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 gives a_9 = 29524, leading to the same result when multiplied by 3.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

It seems like each step involves multiplying 3 by a sum of 1 and another 3 times something. Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, it'll be easier.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last one: 1+3. Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which equals 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). Wait, no, let me check again. Actually, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So, let me map this out step by step.\n\nLet me denote each level as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n...\nAnd so on, until Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the expression has nine 1+3 terms. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). So, let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each next layer wraps another 1+3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recursive structure.\n\nLet me try to compute each level step by step.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original problem is 3*(Level 9). So, after computing Level 9, I need to multiply that result by 3.\n\nSo, Level 9 is 29524, so the final result is 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculation again because 3*29524 should be:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each level to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me verify Level 9 again because 3*9841 is 29523, and 29523 + 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute it as 29524*3.\n\nBreaking down 29524:\n\n20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20000*3 = 60,000\n\n9000*3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500*3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n20*3 = 60 \u2192 88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nHmm, but let me check Level 8 again because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might have made a mistake.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279. So, 3000 + 279 = 3279.\n\n1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: 300*3=900, 64*3=192. So, 900 + 192 = 1092.\n\n1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 = 363.\n\n1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 1: 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all levels check out. Therefore, the final result after multiplying Level 9 by 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the original expression is 3*(...), and each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So, starting from the innermost, each step correctly builds up. So, I think I did it right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each level manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the levels:\n\nLevel 1: 4\n\nLevel 2: 13\n\nLevel 3: 40\n\nLevel 4: 121\n\nLevel 5: 364\n\nLevel 6: 1093\n\nLevel 7: 3280\n\nLevel 8: 9841\n\nLevel 9: 29524\n\nWait a minute, these numbers seem familiar. They look like they're related to powers of 3. Let me check:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nHmm, but the levels are 4, 13, 40, etc. Let me see if I can express each level in terms of 3^n.\n\nLevel 1: 4 = (3^2) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10? No, that's not 4. Wait, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each level follows a recurrence relation. Let me define L(n) as the value at level n, where L(1) = 4.\n\nThen, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nSo, for n >=2, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B =4.\n\nAlso, let's consider n=2: L(2)=1 +3*L(1)=1 +3*4=13.\n\nSo, 13 = A*3^2 + B =9A + B.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B =4\n\n2)9A + B =13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 6A =9 => A= 9/6= 3/2=1.5\n\nNow, substitute A=3/2 into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B=4 => 9/2 + B=4 => B=4 -9/2= (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for level n, L(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L(1)= (3^{2} -1)/2= (9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nSo, for level 9, L(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3 * L(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L(n)= (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*L(n)= 3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2= (3^{n+2}-3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*L(9)= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple levels of parentheses. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we can compute each level's value using the recurrence relation L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This leads to the general formula L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for the nth level. Applying this formula up to level 9 and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each level is of the form 1 + 3*(next level). Starting from the innermost level, compute each level step by step.\n\n2. **Compute Each Level**:\n   - Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Level 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n4. **Verification Using Formula**: Recognizing the pattern, the nth level can be computed using L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For level 9:\n   - L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524\n   - Multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It seems like a nested expression where each layer is multiplied by 3 after adding 1. Let me see if I can parse this correctly.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each step one by one without getting confused. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, there's a 1+3, then each subsequent layer is 1+3*(previous result). Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 9. So, there are 9 layers of nesting. That means I'll have to compute this 9 times, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me write this out step by step:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3\n2. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Continue this process until all layers are computed.\n\nWait, actually, let me confirm that. The innermost part is 1 + 3, right? So, that's the first step. Then, moving outwards, each layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is multiplied by 3 after adding 1. So, maybe each step is 3*(1 + previous result). Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each time, it's 3*(1 + something). So, each step is 3*(1 + previous step). That makes sense.\n\nWait, but in the innermost part, it's 1 + 3, so that's 4. Then, moving outwards, the next layer is 1 + 3*4, which is 1 + 12 = 13. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, and so on.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Let me write down each step carefully.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Wait, actually, the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) parts.\n\nStarting from the left: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps it with 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, so actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each step is 1 + 3*(previous), but the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, perhaps I should consider that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, each time computing the value inside the parentheses, then moving out.\n\nSo, let's start:\n\nStep 1: Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: Next layer: 1 + 3*(Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: Next layer: 1 + 3*(Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: Next layer: 1 + 3*(Step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: Next layer: 1 + 3*(Step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: Next layer: 1 + 3*(Step 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: Next layer: 1 + 3*(Step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: Next layer: 1 + 3*(Step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: Next layer: 1 + 3*(Step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Step 9), right? Because the outermost is 3*(...). So, after computing Step 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Let me recount the layers because I think I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, let's see: the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost is 3*(...). So, how many times do we have 1 + 3*(...) before the outermost 3*?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(...). Each 1 + 3*(... is a layer.\n\nWait, let me write it out as layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers inside, and then multiplied by 3. So, yes, 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my initial steps up to Step 9 being 29524, then the final result is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but when I did the steps, I went up to Step 9 as 29524, but that was after 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, the final step would be 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, but let me check that. Because when I started, I thought the innermost was 1 + 3, which is 4, then each step adds 1 + 3*(previous). So, 9 steps of that, and then the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and the outermost is 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, each being 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, so let's recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n20 * 3 = 60 + 1 = 61 \u2192 write down 1, carry over 6\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 + 6 = 1506 \u2192 write down 6, carry over 150\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000 + 150 = 27,150 \u2192 write down 0, carry over 271\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000 + 271 = 60,271\n\nWait, but that seems off because 29524 * 3 is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back through each step.\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check step 8 again: 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3280 * 3 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nThen step 9: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nThen, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each step is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula to compute a_9 directly.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nAssume a_p = K, then substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 to a_9, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding this, we can see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27\n\nSo, each a_n is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}\n\nWait, that's a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\nYes, so a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but starting from a_1 as sum up to k=1, which is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but the formula for the sum of a geometric series is S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly what we derived earlier.\n\nThus, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each step again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step-by-step.\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression as a single formula.\n\nSince the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, and each layer adds a power of 3, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as 3*(sum of powers of 3 up to 3^9) minus some constant.\n\nBut I think the approach I took earlier is sufficient.\n\nWait, another way: since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4, and we have a_9 = 29,524, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a base-3 number or something, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation.\n\nWait, just to ensure, let me compute 3*29,524 again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way: 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572\n\nYes, that works too.\n\nSo, all methods confirm that the result is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the innermost result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see if I can tackle this by starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. I think that's the usual approach when dealing with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is the last \"1+3\". Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3\n\nOkay, so that's 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, each time it's 1 + 3*(something). So maybe I should work from the inside out, calculating each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to break it down layer by layer. Let's count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. 1 + 3*(result from step 3)\n5. 1 + 3*(result from step 4)\n6. 1 + 3*(result from step 5)\n7. 1 + 3*(result from step 6)\n8. 1 + 3*(result from step 7)\n9. 1 + 3*(result from step 8)\n10. Finally, multiply the result by 3.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(...). So after step 9, we have to multiply by 3. Let me confirm how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, I see there are 9 layers.

So starting from the innermost, let's compute each step.\n\nLet me list each step from 1 to 9, starting with the innermost.\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(Step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(Step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(Step 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(Step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(Step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(Step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after Step 9, we have 29524, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3. Wait, no, actually, the initial expression is 3*(...). So after Step 9, which is the outermost layer, we have to multiply that result by 3.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check the structure again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is step 1, and each subsequent step adds another layer until the 9th step, which is the outermost before the initial 3. So after step 9, we have the value inside the parentheses, which is 29524, and then we multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, final step: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Let me verify one more time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each step manually, just to cross-verify.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each step as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. So, a_9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again because that's a crucial step.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nMultiplying by 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nFinally, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards.

It looks like each layer has a 3 multiplied by a term that's 1 plus another similar expression. So, it's like a chain of these 1 + 3(...) terms, each time multiplied by 3. Hmm, maybe I can solve this by starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. The innermost part is 1 + 3. Then, that result is multiplied by 3, and then added 1, and so on. Wait, no, actually, each time it's 1 plus 3 times the next expression. So, maybe I can represent this as a recursive expression or something.\n\nLet me try writing it out step by step. Let's define each layer as a term. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 1 + 3(...), that's a new layer. Let's count them.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3( result of step 1 )\n3. 1 + 3( result of step 2 )\n...\nUp to 9 layers, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each time we go out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's define each step.\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, S3, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost, and S9 is the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is S1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(S1), which is S2. Then, the next is 1 + 3*(S2) = S3, and so on, up to S9, and then the entire expression is 3*(S9).\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(S9), but let me check how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to parse the expression.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3*(...), so starting from 1 + 3, that's layer 1, then 1 + 3*(layer1) is layer2, and so on. Let's see how many layers:\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3*, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, that would be 9 layers, each time nested inside the previous one. So, S1 is 1 + 3, S2 is 1 + 3*S1, S3 is 1 + 3*S2, up to S9, and then the entire expression is 3*S9.\n\nWait, but the initial expression is 3*(...), so perhaps S9 is the innermost, and then the outer expression is 3*(S9). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to start from the innermost and work outward. Let's try that.\n\nLet me start from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. Let's compute that first.\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*S1. So,\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out:\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext:\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*S9, so:\n\nResult = 3 * S9 = 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing S9. Let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting from S1:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, S9 is 29524, and then 3*S9 is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me check S8 again because 3*3280 is 9840, which is correct. Then S9 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Wait, no, that's incorrect.\n\nWait, no, S9 is 1 + 3*S8. S8 was 9841, so 3*S8 is 3*9841.\n\nWait, did I compute S9 correctly?\n\nWait, S8 is 9841, so 3*S8 is 3*9841. Let me compute that.\n\n3*9841:\n\nCompute 9841 * 3.\n\n1*3 = 3\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n8*3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 write 5, carryover 2\n\n9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 write 9, carryover 2\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a 4-digit number: 9,8,4,1.\n\nWait, let me compute 9841 * 3:\n\n1*3 = 3\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n8*3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 write 5, carryover 2\n\n9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 write 9, carryover 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2 at the beginning.\n\nSo, 9841 * 3 = 29,523.\n\nWait, that's 29,523. So, S9 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought S9 was 29,524, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I wrote S9 as 29,524, which is correct because 3*9841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*S9 is 3*29,524.\n\nLet me compute that again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method, perhaps by adding 29,524 three times.\n\n29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048\n\n59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the earlier steps, like when computing S3, S4, etc.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nYes, all these steps check out.\n\nSo, 3*S9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving the recurrence relation.\n\nWe have S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is S_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume S_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is S_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, S_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nS_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each n, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check if this formula works with the earlier values.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nS1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nS2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nS3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nS4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nS5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nS6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\nS7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280.

So, S9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I went through each step carefully, and also verified using a different method by solving the recurrence relation.

    "text": " The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses and threes. Let me try to figure out how to approach this. It seems like a nested expression where each part is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with these kinds of problems.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. The innermost part is (1 + 3), so replacing that, the next layer is (1 + 3*(result of innermost)). Hmm, maybe I should write down each step more carefully.\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost for clarity. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4)\n3. Then the next layer: (1 + 3*(result of step 2))\n4. And so on, until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, let me compute each step one by one.\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nSo, replacing the innermost part, the expression now is:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)))))))$\n\nWait, actually, I think I misapplied the replacement. Let me correct that. Each time, I replace the innermost (1 + 3) with 4, and then move outward, computing each subsequent layer.\n\nLet me try again, perhaps by working from the inside out, computing each nested expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: Now, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(Layer 1)). So, that's (1 + 3*4).\n\nCompute 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, Layer 2 = 13\n\nLayer 3: Next layer out is (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = (1 + 3*13)\n\nCompute 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 3 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = (1 + 3*40)\n\nCompute 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 4 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = (1 + 3*121)\n\n3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 5 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = (1 + 3*364)\n\nCompute 3*364: Let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 6 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = (1 + 3*1093)\n\nCompute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 7 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = (1 + 3*3280)\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 8 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = (1 + 3*9841)\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nLayer 9 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524: Let's do this step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\nThen, 9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1.\n\nSo, breaking down 29524*3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify each step because that's a lot of computation, and it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOutermost: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check Layer 9 again: 3*9841.\n\nCompute 9841*3:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nSo, 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524, which is correct.\n\nThen, 29524*3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as n=1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9\n\nSo, we can compute each a_n step by step.\n\nLet me compute each a_n:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nWait, that gives a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2.\n\nWait, but that's a fractional value, and our initial terms are integers. Maybe that's correct, but let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the particular solution. Let me try again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, to find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1,\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9,\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, 3^10 is 59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, a_9 is (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8.

It seems like each layer is a multiplication by 3 added to 1, and then that result is multiplied by another 3 and so on. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually makes sense with nested expressions.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that innermost part becomes 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(that result). Wait, no, actually, looking again, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). Let me check:\n\nWait, actually, no. Wait, looking at the expression:\n\nIt's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... and so on. So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(result from previous layer)), and so on.\n\nWait, maybe it's better if I list each step from the inside out. Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each time moving outwards, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), but each time, the inner part is 1 + 3*(inner result). So maybe each step is 3*(1 + previous step).\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as each step being 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, it's 3*(1 + something).

Wait, no, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and work outwards, calculating each step as 1 + 3*(result from inner step), then multiplying by 3 each time.\n\nWait, let me try again.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(Step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(Step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(Step 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(Step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(Step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(Step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Step 9).

Let me recount the layers.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, it's (1+3(...)), so let's count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Now, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial count, I only went up to 9 steps, but in the original expression, the number of layers is 9, so after step 9, we have 29524, and then we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo that would be 88572.\n\nBut let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me check the multiplication again:\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: 29,524 \u00d7 3.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3: 20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't skip any layers or make a calculation error in any step.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's 9 layers inside the main 3*(...), so 10 steps including the final multiplication.\n\nWait, no, actually, the initial expression is 3*(...), where the ... is 9 layers deep. So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers inside, then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe result of the computation is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards step by step. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break down the computation as follows:\n\n1. Evaluate the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ (1 + 3) = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue with the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the result of the computation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
