Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see: Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this, after n steps, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. But in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Wait, this seems like the sum of a geometric series. Indeed, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Because each step adds another term of 3^k. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = sum_{k=0}^1 3^k. a_2 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = sum_{k=0}^2 3^k. a_3 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = sum_{k=0}^3 3^k. So, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the closed-form we found earlier. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.

Let me just double-check my computations for each layer quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572 Yep, that seems consistent. Alternatively, using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then 3*a_9=88572. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
