    "text": " So the total would be 88,572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or miscalculate. Let's list each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, but let me make sure that I'm not missing any layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3 times the previous. So, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each time wrapping another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, yes, 9 layers. So, 88,572 would be the correct answer. But to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to check for any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find the closed-form solution.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely certain, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the closed-form formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form formula.\n\nBut regardless of the method, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, the result is the same: 88,572.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next inner term})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer (Layer 1)**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute Each Subsequent Layer**:\n   - **Layer 2**:\n     \\[\n     1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n     \\]\n   - **Layer 3**:\n     \\[\n     1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n     \\]\n   - **Layer 4**:\n     \\[\n     1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n     \\]\n   - **Layer 5**:\n     \\[\n     1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n     \\]\n   - **Layer 6**:\n     \\[\n     1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n     \\]\n   - **Layer 7**:\n     \\[\n     1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n     \\]\n   - **Layer 8**:\n     \\[\n     1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n     \\]\n   - **Layer 9**:\n     \\[\n     1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n     \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3**:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So 300+60+3=363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As computed earlier, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again: 29524\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I did everything correctly, computing each layer step by step and then multiplying the outermost layer by 3. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down one at a time made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers: Each time I see a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, we have 9 layers: each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, yes, layer 1 is 1+3, layer 2 is 1+3*(layer1), etc., up to layer9, which is the outermost. So, I think my computation is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, using the recurrence relation approach also gives me the same answer, confirming that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a base-3 number or something, but I think the recurrence method is solid. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a recurrence relation. Maybe there's a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me try to model this recurrence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{part} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, to save time and reduce errors. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's test this. For n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2, L_2=13. So, 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we can set up a system of equations: 3A + B = 4\n9A + B = 13\nSubtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

    "text": " So the final result is 88572. But let me check my calculations again because this seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, multiplying that by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it does grow exponentially. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for geometric series or something similar. Wait, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive relation. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see, the recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L(n) = A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides, we get B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L(9), which is 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. Same result. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me define the terms more formally. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, the problem is essentially computing a_9 and then multiplying by 3. Alternatively, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, which might help in computing it without having to compute each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result.

Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so perhaps each layer is a term in a sequence. Let me denote the value of the nth layer as a_n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, this seems like a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n follows a pattern where each term is multiplied by 3 and adds 1, so using the formula for the sum of a geometric series might have been another approach, but the recurrence method worked well here. Either way, both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be expressed using a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Let's suppose we have an expression like E = a + bE', where E' is another similar expression. But in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So it's more like each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*previous. So, if I model it as a recurrence relation: Let\u2019s define L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the closed-form formula. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(L_9). From the formula, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that confirms it again. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've computed it step by step, then found a closed-form formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next layer.

Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, so let's see if I can find a pattern or formula for this. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3*a_1=1+12=13, a_3=1+3*a_2=1+39=40, and so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n, which would help in computing a_9 without having to compute each layer step by step. Let's try solving the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)}=K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f a_1=4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f a_2=13.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f a_3=40.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression step by step to see if that's possible. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3))...)). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, so each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. If I expand this, starting from the innermost, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))). Each layer adds another 3^k term. Let me try to write it out: Let's denote the entire expression as E. Then, E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let's see how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Counting the number of layers: The expression is 3*(...), and inside, it's 1 +3*(...), and so on. Let me count the number of times 1 +3* occurs. Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 +3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. So, how many layers? Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*: The first is 1 +3*(..., then inside that, another 1 +3*(..., and so on. Let me count them: 1. 3*(1 +3*(...))\n2. ...*(1 +3*(...))\n3. ...*(1 +3*(...))\n4. ...*(1 +3*(...))\n5. ...*(1 +3*(...))\n6. ...*(1 +3*(...))\n7. ...*(1 +3*(...))\n8. ...*(1 +3*(...))\n9. ...*(1 +3*(...))\n10. ...*(1 +3))\n\nWait, actually, the initial 3*(...) is the first layer, and inside that, each time we have another 1 +3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1. Then, each layer wraps around that, so layer 2, up to layer 9. Wait, but when I counted earlier, I had 9 layers, from layer 1 to layer 9. So, in the formula, a_9=29524, and E=3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of E as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th layer, which we've already computed as 29524, leading to E=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4. Then, the next layer is 1 +3*4=13. Then, 1 +3*13=40, etc., as we did before. Alternatively, if I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...+3*(1 +3))))). Let me try to expand it step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\nLet me expand the innermost first:\n\nInnermost: 1 +3 =4.\n\nNext layer: 1 +3*4=13.\n\nNext:1 +3*13=40.\n\nNext:1 +3*40=121.\n\nNext:1 +3*121=364.\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent E as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see:\n\nEach time we have 1 +3*something. So, expanding E:\n\nE =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\nLet me try to expand this step by step:\n\nStart from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1:1 +3=4.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1 +12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nE=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see:\n\nEach time we have a term like 1 +3*(...), so when we expand it, each layer contributes a term of 3^k. Let's see:\n\nE=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)))=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)))\n\nIf I denote S as the sum inside, then S=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)).\n\nWait, but S is similar to E, but without the initial 3*. Wait, no, E=3*(S), where S=1 +3*(S'), where S' is another similar expression.\n\nWait, actually, this might get complicated, but perhaps I can express S in terms of itself.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me denote S as the entire expression inside the first 3*. So, E=3*S, where S=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))).\n\nBut the expression inside the first 3*(...) is similar to S itself, except it's one layer less. Wait, no, actually, it's the same structure, just shorter.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think recursively. Let me denote S_n as the sum after n layers. So, S_1=1+3=4, S_2=1+3*S_1=13, S_3=1+3*S_2=40, etc., up to S_9=29524, as we computed before. Then, E=3*S_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for S_n, which we did earlier as S_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, S_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Then, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of E as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to expand E:\n\nE=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\nLet me try to write this out step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me expand the innermost parentheses first:\n\nInnermost:1 +3=4.\n\nNext layer:1 +3*4=1 +12=13.\n\nNext:1 +3*13=1 +39=40.\n\nNext:1 +3*40=1 +120=121.\n\nNext:1 +3*121=1 +363=364.\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280.\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, same result again.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.

So, we have a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. So, the expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can see that this recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's thorough enough. I've checked each step, and even used a different method (recurrence relation) to confirm the result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my computations for each layer because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let's go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Seems solid. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11. 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it directly, using the formula. This method is faster and less error-prone, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods work. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap: The problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By working from the inside out, computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the innermost value of 4, then built up each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost layer's value of 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572. Additionally, by recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, I confirmed the result using a formula, which is a more efficient method. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found assuming it's a constant, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. So, for n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.

Alternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), which is similar to a geometric progression but with a multiplier of 3 each time. Let me see if I can find a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value at layer n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: a_1 = 3A + B = 4. We know B = -1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = (L_1 - b/(1 - a)) * a^{n-1} + b/(1 - a). Wait, but in this case, a = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula would be L_n = (L_1 - b/(1 - a)) * a^{n-1} + b/(1 - a). Plugging in the values: L_1 = 4, a = 3, b = 1. So, L_n = (4 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3). Simplify denominator: 1 - 3 = -2. So, L_n = (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2). That simplifies to (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let's compute this for n=9. L_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Compute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^4=81, 3^8=6561. So, L_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2 = (9*6561)/2 - 1/2. Compute 9*6561: 6561*9. Let's compute that: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So, 54000 + 4500 = 58500, 58500 + 540 = 59040, 59040 + 9 = 59049. Therefore, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before, so that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. So, L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, etc. I notice that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series, but it's multiplied by 3 each time and added 1. Maybe there's a recursive formula here. Let me try to find a general formula for Ln. Let's see: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is known. For the recurrence relation Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, the solution is Ln = a^(n) * L0 + b*(a^(n) - 1)/(a - 1), but in this case, the recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1. Wait, no, because each Ln is 1 + 3*Ln-1, so it's Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1.\n\nSo, more accurately, the recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, L1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. So, perhaps the initial term is L1 = 4, and then each subsequent term is built upon that.\n\nThe standard solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\nA - 3A = 1\n-2A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9, which is L9, is (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L9 = (3^10 -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nTherefore, 3*L9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, either way, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where:\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3L_1 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3L_2 \\)\n- and so on up to \\( L_9 \\)\n\nComputing each layer:\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n- \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might have saved me some time. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a general formula for the nth term. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this method confirms the earlier result.

Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let's see if we can model this. Let me define each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Wait, actually, when I started, I thought there were nine layers, but let's check again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each 1+3( starts a new layer. So starting from the first 3, the innermost is 1+3, then each 1+3 wraps around the previous. So, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3. Then, each layer wraps around, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1+3( before the innermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each (1+3( is a new layer. Let's count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3)\n\nWait, that's nine opening parentheses after the first 3. So, does that mean there are nine layers? But in my initial step-by-step, I had Layer 1 to Layer 9, each computed as above. So, according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the exponentiation. 3^10 is indeed 59049, since 3^5 is 243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, 3^{11}=3*59049=177147. Correct. So, 177147-3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. First, write the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 +1/2=3C => 9/2=3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. Good. So, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or something. Each layer n is equal to 1 + 3*(layer n-1). So, it's a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Solving such a recurrence, the general solution for a linear recurrence like this would be a_n = A*3^n + B. To find A and B, we can use the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the homogeneous solution is 3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let's assume the particular solution is a constant C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Then, each a_n can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula confirms the earlier result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9, then each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see. The recursive formula is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2)-1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L(2)= (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: L(9)=(3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost layer is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Each time, you're adding 1 and then tripling the previous amount. So, the entire expression can be seen as a sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. But in this case, since each term is nested, it's more efficient to use the recursive approach or the formula we derived. Either way, the answer seems to be 88572. Let me just check once more to ensure there are no arithmetic errors. So, 3^10 is 59049. Then, subtracting 1 gives 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 3^10 step by step: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049.

Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = -1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (-1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = -1 => -2B = -1 => B=1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + 1/2 => 4 = 3A + 1/2 => 3A = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2 => A = 7/6. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (7/6)*3 + 1/2 = (7/6)*3 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 1/2 = 10.5 + 0.5 = 11. Wait, but earlier I computed a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, maybe my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the recurrence relation. Let me check. Wait, in the problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is correct. But according to my general solution, a_2 should be (7/6)*3^2 + 1/2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = 63/6 + 3/6 = 66/6 = 11. But when I computed manually, a_2 was 13. That's a problem. So, perhaps my particular solution was incorrect. Let me try again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and find a particular solution. Homogeneous equation: a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct, which matches my manual calculation. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the equation: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer, which is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let's see. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a_n is the value of the nth layer.

Specifically, each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis kind of recurrence can be solved using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

For n=1, a_1 should be 4. Plugging in, (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 should be 13. (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.

Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, just to verify. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), but wait, that formula is for a homogeneous recurrence with constant coefficients, but in this case, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term b. Let me recall the formula for the solution of a linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition, when n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for L_9, which is the 9th layer, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, that's correct. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*L_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.

Then multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that I can apply to verify my result. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, but what is the initial condition? The innermost layer is Layer 1: L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So when n=1, L_1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 =3 *29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.

Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems to be correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, maybe I can compute it more quickly without computing each layer step by step. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me rewrite it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could compute 3^{10} directly and then apply the formula. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049. So, yes, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. So, that's consistent. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the formula approach gave me the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. Alternatively, this might be a geometric series or something similar, but let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.

The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let me solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed.

For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute it without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. Then, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. So, we have L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with L1: n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. L2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. L3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, Ln=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9: L9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L9)=3*29524=88572.

    "text": " So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute them incorrectly. Let's list each layer's computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nThen, multiply Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...), so the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which we computed as 29524. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. But to be thorough, let me check each layer again for any calculation errors.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080+12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: As before, 29524*3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, perhaps I can try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so 3 * L_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nIn our case, n=9, so 3*L_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that confirms it again. So, regardless of the method, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by deriving a formula for the nth layer, which gives the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), leading to a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence yields a closed-form expression, confirming that the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next layer})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9} = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer**:  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me recompute the layers to see if I made an error there. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated application of the operation 1 + 3*(previous result). That looks like a geometric series or perhaps something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw earlier. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. Now, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since this is a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which in this case is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Next, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9). So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it. So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute the result without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's pretty cool, but I guess for someone just starting out, computing each layer step by step might be more straightforward, even if it's a bit tedious. Either way, both methods lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see. Let me denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, starting from a_1=4, a_2=1 + 3*4=13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, and so on up to a_9. Then the final result is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might be a quicker way. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.

Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, maybe. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), but I need to check if that applies here.\n\nWait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c = 3, d = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since d is a constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. Good. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which confirms the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"
