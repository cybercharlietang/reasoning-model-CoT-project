Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let's do that step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 88,572. Hmm, same result. Maybe that's correct. But let me verify each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer step by step again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093 is 3279, correct. 3279 +1 = 3280, correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, it seems my calculation is correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formulaic way to compute this without expanding each layer, but given the time, maybe it's better to stick with the step-by-step approach. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, maybe in a different way, to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I could consider that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, starting from 1, each term is 1 + 3n, where n is the previous term. So, that's a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually, just to confirm. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked by both computing each layer step by step and also by solving the recurrence relation, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, same result. So, maybe it's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each layer, which might be more efficient and less error-prone. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. In fact, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying that: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find an expression for the entire original problem without computing each layer. Let me think. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Let me verify my calculations because that number seems quite large. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that each layer follows a certain pattern, maybe a geometric series or something else. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nApplying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nWe can also find another equation by considering the homogeneous solution. Wait, actually, for a nonhomogeneous recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the solution can be found as follows:\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9, since there are nine layers. So, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the value I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I got before. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to think about it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation. That might have been a faster way, but since I didn't see it immediately, I had to compute each layer step by step, which took more time but also helped me understand the pattern.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes in my step-by-step computation. Each layer was:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. For example, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, correct.\n\nSo, I think I've arrived at the correct answer after carefully computing each layer and verifying my calculations. It's interesting how the numbers grow exponentially because each layer is multiplied by 3, leading to very large numbers quickly. It's a good reminder of how geometric progressions work and how they can result in rapidly increasing values.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is a term in a geometric sequence where each term is three times the previous term plus one. This kind of recurrence relation is common in problems involving repeated operations or nested functions, and it's good to recognize these patterns because they can often be solved with a formula rather than computing each term individually.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and computing each nested layer step by step, I was able to solve the problem and arrive at the final answer. Additionally, by recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrences, I confirmed that the answer is consistent and correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Finally, we multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Okay, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because each layer seems to be growing exponentially, but let me check if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, then the final result is 3*a_9. But perhaps there's a recurrence relation here. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let me try to find B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let's assume the particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think that's correct. I can also note that each a_n follows the pattern a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying by 3. The solution can also be derived using a recurrence relation, confirming the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term).

So, layer 1 is 1+3=4, layer 2 is 1+3*4=13, layer3=1+3*13=40, layer4=1+3*40=121, layer5=1+3*121=364, layer6=1+3*364=1093, layer7=1+3*1093=3280, layer8=1+3*3280=9841, layer9=1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem and see if the pattern holds. For example, let's say we have 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). How would that compute?\n\nCompute innermost first: 1+3=4\nThen next layer: 1+3*4=13\nNext layer: 1+3*13=40\nThen outermost: 3*40=120\n\nLet me compute it directly: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) = 3(1+3(1+3*4)) = 3(1+3(1+12))=3(1+3*13)=3(1+39)=3*40=120. Correct.\n\nIf I use my layer method:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nThen multiply by 3: 3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSo, the method works for a smaller case.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to compute it more efficiently. Each layer seems to follow the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). This is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^n * a_0 + c*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, right? Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. So, to find a_n, we can use the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is when we ignore the constant term, so the homogeneous solution would be a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is a geometric progression, perhaps there's a way to express the entire expression as a sum. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's like 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... up to 3^9, but actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(...), so maybe it's more like a sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, but multiplied by 3. Wait, let me see. If I consider the innermost term as 1 + 3, which is 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2. Similarly, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. Continuing this way, each layer adds another power of 3. So, layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. So, layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40. And so on. So, in general, layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series multiplied by 3. Let me try expanding the expression step by step to see if I can write it as a sum. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me denote the innermost expression as E1 = 1 + 3. Then, moving out, E2 = 1 + 3*E1, E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on up to E9. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9. As I computed before, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. So, 3*E9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, another way to write the entire expression is (3^{11} - 3)/2, which equals 88572. Therefore, regardless of the method I use\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation, or recognizing it as a geometric series\u2014the result is the same: 88572. I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer now. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different approaches all lead to the same result. So, I think I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841.

Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: Break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. I remember that expressions like this, where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous, might form a geometric series or follow a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, but let me think again. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps it would give the same result without computing each term. Let's try that approach. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n, where C is a constant. To find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's check what n is. Wait, in our earlier computation, we started with a_1 as Layer 1, which was 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 was Layer 2, which was 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, up to a_9 = 29524. So, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier result. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we found earlier. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using the formula gives the same answer without having to compute each layer manually. That's a good check. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is a_1, up to the outermost layer, which is a_9, we can compute a_9 as (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). If I expand it all the way, it's like 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to a certain number of terms. Let me try expanding the innermost layers to see if that's the case. Starting from the innermost: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3*1.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121.\n\nWait, this looks like each a_n is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nBut in our case, starting from a_1, which is 4 = 1 + 3.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWhich is similar to the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 up to 3^{n}.\n\nThe sum S of a geometric series with first term 1 and ratio 3, for n+1 terms is S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the formula we derived earlier. So, each a_n is indeed the sum of the geometric series up to 3^{n}. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways: step-by-step computation, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution, and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series.

Hmm, that seems pretty big, but considering how many layers there are, it might make sense. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct).

Okay, so each step checks out. I think I did this correctly. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially because each time you're adding 1 and then tripling the previous amount. So, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. It's like a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but each term is offset by 1. I remember that for such recursive sequences, there's a formula to find the nth term without computing each layer step by step. The general form is a_n = a_{n-1} * r + c, where r is the ratio and c is the constant. In this case, r = 3 and c = 1. The formula for the nth term of such a sequence is a_n = c * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1). Let me verify that with n=1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Using the formula: c=1, r=3, n=1: (3^1 -1)/(3-1) = (3-1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Then, a_1 = 1 * 1 = 1? Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me check again. Wait, no, actually, the formula is for the sum of a geometric series, but in our case, the recursion is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_0 * r^n) + c*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). In our case, a_0 would be the initial term, which is 4 when n=1. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let's see: If n=1 corresponds to the first layer, which is 4, then using the formula: a_n = (a_0 * r^n) + c*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). But I think I might be mixing up the indices here. Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider that each layer is defined as a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, the general solution for such a recurrence is a_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in the recurrence: a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^k + 3B. But since a_k = A*3^k + B, we can set up the equation: A*3^k + B = 1 + A*3^k + 3B. Subtracting A*3^k from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for k=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For k=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For k=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer k, the value is (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: k=1, which is 4. The outermost layer is Layer 9, so k=9. Let's compute Layer 9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. It's interesting how using the formula saves time, especially if there were more layers. But since there were only nine layers, computing step by step was manageable, albeit a bit tedious. I think I understand now how these nested expressions work. Each time, you're tripling the previous value and adding 1, leading to exponential growth. It's like each layer is contributing significantly more to the total value as you move outward. I wonder if there's a real-world application for such a sequence. Maybe in finance or population growth models where growth is exponential with a constant addition each period. But that's probably beyond the scope of this problem. Anyway, I think I've solved it correctly. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything: 1. Identified the nested structure and decided to compute from the innermost layer. 2. Computed each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. 3. Verified each computation to prevent errors. 4. Realized a pattern and derived a general formula using the recurrence relation. 5. Applied the formula to compute Layer 9 directly. 6. Multiplied the result by 3 to get the final answer. 7. Cross-verified both methods to ensure consistency. So, yeah, I think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident in the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find a closed-form formula. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We need another condition, but since the recurrence is first-order, that's sufficient. However, let's compute a few terms to see the pattern. L_1 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\nL_2 = 13 = 3^2 + 3 + 1\nWait, 3^2 is 9, 9 + 3 + 1 = 13. Similarly, L_3 = 40. Let's see: 3^3 = 27, 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40. Yes, that seems to fit. So, each L_n = 3^n + 3^{n-1} + ... + 3^1 + 1. That's a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 up to 3^n. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let's verify that. The sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r = 3, so S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches L_1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches L_2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which matches L_3. Perfect! So, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this method is much faster and less error-prone than computing each layer step by step. It also explains why the numbers were growing so rapidly\u2014each layer is essentially a geometric progression with ratio 3. So, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series saved me a lot of time. I should remember this approach for similar problems in the future. It's always good to look for patterns and see if a formula can be applied instead of brute-force computation, especially when dealing with nested expressions or recurrence relations.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by recognizing a geometric series pattern. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a geometric series with a common ratio of 3. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we find the innermost layer and work our way out, ultimately multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). This indicates a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recognize the Geometric Series**: Each layer can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3. The nth layer, L_n, is given by the sum 1 + 3 + 3\u00b2 + ... + 3\u207f, which is a geometric series.\n\n3. **Use the Geometric Series Formula**: The sum of the first (n+1) terms of a geometric series with ratio 3 is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Innermost Layer**: The innermost layer (Layer 1) is 1 + 3 = 4, which fits the formula for n=1.\n\n5. **Generalize for All Layers**: Each subsequent layer can be computed using the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For Layer 9 (the outermost), n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n6. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct).

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did it right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model this. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, setting equal: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(L_9). Let's compute L_9 using the formula: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I calculated earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, yeah, I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the outermost layer efficiently. Finally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(another term)}\\).

So, the final answer is 88572. I think I did this right, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, we have: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, using the closed-form formula also gives the same result, which makes me confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that angle as well, just to see if it aligns with the previous results. The expression a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be expanded recursively. Let's expand a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121\n\nHmm, I see a pattern here. Each a_n is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 up to 3^{n}. Let's see:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 = 121\n\nSo, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but wait, let me check: For a_1, sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k is 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor a_2, sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, so a_n is the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of 3^k. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S_n = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio. Here, r=3, so S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. This method also leads us to the same result, so I'm even more confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Another way to approach this might be to recognize that the entire expression is a geometric series multiplied by 3. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If we let the innermost expression be x, then each layer is 1 + 3x, and the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3x) = 1 + 3 + 9x, and so on. However, since there are nine layers, it's a bit involved, but perhaps we can express it as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, actually, when we computed a_n, we saw that a_n is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^n. So, a_9 is the sum up to 3^9. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(sum_{k=0}^9 3^k). Let's compute that sum first. The sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k is S = (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, 3*S = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. Therefore, regardless of the approach\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, using the closed-form formula for the geometric series, or recognizing the recursive pattern\u2014we end up with the same final answer: 88572. Just to ensure that I haven't missed anything, let me think about the structure of the problem again. It's a nested expression with nine layers, each adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, each subsequent layer adds another power of 3. So, the innermost is 4, then 13, 40, and so on, each time tripling the previous sum and adding 1. The key insight here is that each layer effectively adds the next power of 3, leading to the sum of a geometric series. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to a multiple of that sum, which we've already calculated. I think I've covered all possible angles here. I've computed each layer step by step, derived a closed-form formula, and recognized the geometric series pattern. All methods converge on the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric series pattern. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), forming a geometric series.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers.

The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I computed up to Layer 9, which is correct. So, 3 times Layer 9 is indeed the entire expression. So, I think my approach is correct. Another way to think about it is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is just 1 + 3*(previous result). It's a recursive computation, but since it's finite, I can compute each step manually. I could also try to find a general formula for such expressions, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Alternatively, if there were many more layers, I might look for a pattern or a formula, perhaps involving geometric series or something similar.

Hmm, let me verify that again because the numbers are getting big, and it's easy to make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate a step, leading to a wrong answer down the line. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, it seems like each step checks out. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. In this case, n is 9. Maybe I can find a general formula for this kind of nested expression. Let's denote the value at layer k as L_k. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on. So, in general, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L_k = 3*L_{k-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when k=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure. For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For k=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer k, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can express the final result using the formula. Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88,572 is the correct result. I don't think I made any mistakes here because each step checked out, and the formula approach corroborated the step-by-step computation. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me verify my earlier steps where I computed each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake there. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, maybe? Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, as before.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as above. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, the result is 88572, which matches my step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see a pattern in the numbers I got for each layer:\n\na1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524.\n\nEach time, multiplying by 3 and adding 1? Wait, no, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the expression as a geometric series. Let me try to express a_n in terms of the previous terms.\n\nWait, the general formula I found earlier is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the result without computing each layer step by step, which might be more efficient for larger n.\n\nBut since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step was manageable, though time-consuming.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my initial step-by-step computation.

Since each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, and starting from 4, the layers go up as 4,13,40,121, etc., each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nBut regardless, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked my work enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.

Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is built this way. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 is 1 + 3*a1, etc., up to a9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a1=4= A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can also find a second equation by looking at n=0, but since the problem starts at n=1, maybe we can use another approach. Alternatively, let's compute a few terms and see if we can spot a pattern. a1=4=3 +1=3^1 +1. a2=13=9 +4=3^2 +4. a3=40=27 +13=3^3 +13. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, maybe the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2 + 1? Wait, let me test that. For n=1: (3^2 -3)/2 +1=(9-3)/2 +1=6/2 +1=3+1=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -3)/2 +1=(27-3)/2 +1=24/2 +1=12+1=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -3)/2 +1=(81-3)/2 +1=78/2 +1=39+1=40. Correct. So, the general formula seems to be a_n = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2 +1. Let me simplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1} -3 +2)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check that for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so that formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for a9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each step is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, perhaps the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which is a geometric series with ratio 3. But in this case, since it's finite (nine layers), maybe I can express it as a sum. Let me try to write it out. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. But perhaps it's better to think recursively. Alternatively, since I've already found that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and E = 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, E = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or recognize the pattern as a geometric series, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, 29524 *3 = 88572. That matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or look for a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation, especially since there are nine layers. This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can model this recursion as a geometric progression. Let's see: The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me try to find a steady-state solution. Let\u2019s assume that the sequence approaches a limit L as n approaches infinity. Then, L = 1 + 3L. Solving for L: L = 1 + 3L \u2192 0 = 1 + 2L \u2192 L = -1/2. Hmm, but that's negative, and our sequence is clearly positive and increasing. So, maybe this approach isn't the best here. Alternatively, perhaps we can express a_n in terms of a geometric series. Let's write out the terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 9*4 = 1 + 3 + 36 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27*4 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 108 = 121\n\nWait, I see a pattern here. Each a_n can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see:\n\na_1 = 4 = 3 + 1\na_2 = 13 = 3^2 + 3 + 1\na_3 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1\na_4 = 121 = 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nWait, that seems to fit. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88,572. I think I've verified it enough ways now. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the result of the inner layer into the outer one. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, which is derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": " Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, putting it all together, the result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous term. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's also compute L_2 to set up another equation. L_2 = 13 = 3*L_1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. Using the general solution for L_2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. So now we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula for L_n is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute L_9 directly without computing each layer, which would have saved time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there were only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and plan to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, ensuring each calculation was correct. 3. Alternatively, derive a formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation, which provides a direct computation method. 4. Apply the formula to find the value of the outermost layer, then multiply by 3 to get the final result. This problem was a good exercise in recognizing recursive patterns and applying both iterative computation and formula derivation to solve it efficiently.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows a recursive pattern. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer can be expressed using the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula for the 9th layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern, perhaps a geometric series or something similar, but given that each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, it's a linear recurrence. Maybe there's a formula for that. Let's think about it. Let me denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our previous calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572, which is the same as before. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula. That might have saved some time instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the expression were much longer. But since it's only nine layers, computing each step was manageable. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.
