Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. Break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added 1 each time. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me explore that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Since this is a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and saved some computation time by using the formula. But since I was working through it step by step, the recursive computation was manageable, especially since there are only nine layers. If there were more layers, the formula would definitely be more efficient. In summary, by either recursively computing each layer or by finding a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result: 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same place. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the right solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and multiply the outermost result by 3. Using both recursive computation and a closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.

Wait, no, after the 2*3 step, we're done. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of digits. Let me count: 29524 has 5 digits.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a formula for a_n, which might help confirm my step-by-step calculations. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9) where a_9 is defined by the recurrence. So, using the formula, a_9=29524, so 3*a_9=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that all adds up. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).

Wait, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3 might be more straightforward. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. So, putting it all together, each layer was computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, starting from 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer does the same. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, correct. So, I think that's the right answer. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should compute each layer again quickly to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next: 2*3=6, write down 6. So, reading from top: 68572? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the digits. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers again. Let me check Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final answer after multiplying by 3 is indeed 88572. I think that's solid. So, yeah, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Let me recompute each layer step by step to verify.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote the nth layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's look at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I substitute the general solution into this, I get: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = 3A + B = 3A - 1/2. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. Similarly, for n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Alternatively, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without having to go through each layer, which is much more efficient. I think this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Just to make sure, let me try computing one more layer manually using the formula. For example, n=5: a_5 should be (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, which matches my earlier computation. So, the formula works. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Hmm, wait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems quite large. Maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that more carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check with another method. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check once more because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs. Starting from the innermost: Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. From the innermost to the outermost, how many are there? Let's see: 1+3 (layer 1), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, layer 1: 1+3, layer 2: 1+3(layer1), layer3:1+3(layer2), up to layer9:1+3(layer8). So, 9 layers in total, each computed as above. Therefore, the computation seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Wait, but let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula that applies here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a recurrence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (as computed earlier). Then, the sequence is a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_1 = 4, let's plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Similarly, for n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B =13. Now, we can set up the system of equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B =13 (2) Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2): 6A =9 => A= 9/6= 3/2. Then, from equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B=4 => 9/2 + B=4 => B=4 - 9/2= (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we're doing this nine times, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider the general form. Let's say we have a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's write down the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the nth term is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers. Let me confirm: The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = a_1. Then Layer 2 is a_2, up to Layer 9 being a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier result. So, that's a good confirmation. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, using the closed-form formula gives me the same answer without having to compute each layer step by step, which is much more efficient. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(...), and the entire expression was multiplied by 3. By recognizing the pattern and finding a closed-form solution using recurrence relations, I was able to compute the result efficiently. Alternatively, computing each layer step by step also led me to the same answer, but it was more time-consuming and error-prone. So, it's a good reminder that recognizing patterns and using mathematical formulas can save a lot of time in problem-solving.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can recognize a pattern and use a recurrence relation.\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n2. **Recurrence relation**: Let \\(a_n\\) be the value of the nth layer.

Let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem, perhaps using a formula for geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the result is indeed 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to Layer 9, we get 29524.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that's a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then +1=9841. Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then +1=29524. Correct) Then 3*29524: As above, 3*29524=88572. So, all layers check out. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or solved using a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but maybe I can compute it step by step as I did before, which seems straightforward. Alternatively, solving the recurrence relation: The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recursive pattern, we find that each layer can be computed using the formula \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\). Solving this recurrence relation gives a closed-form solution, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me recompute each layer step by step.

So, 29524*3=88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused because I think there might be a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Maybe I can represent each layer as a term in a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, yeah, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a recursive formula. I wonder if there's a closed-form solution for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. Maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it's homogeneous. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + D => 4 = 3C + D. Now, let's find another condition. Let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: a_2 = C*3^2 + D = 9C + D. So, 13 = 9C + D. Now, we have a system of equations: 4 = 3C + D 13 = 9C + D Let's subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9C + D) - (3C + D) => 9 = 6C => C = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute C back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + D => 4 = 9/2 + D => D = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then 3*29524=88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, and there are nine layers, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: The innermost term is 3, then each layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3. So, the expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))), with nine layers. Alternatively, using the formula for a geometric series, the sum S = a*(r^n -1)/(r-1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. But in this case, each term is being added and multiplied by 3, so it's a bit different. Alternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which gives a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recursive approach and the closed-form formula both lead to the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and a closed-form solution, we determine that the innermost value (Layer 9) is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Wait, actually, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 0.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\nBut wait, that's beyond the digits. Wait, 29524 has 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4. So when I multiply:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u21927, carry 0\n5 \u00d73=15 \u21925, carry 1\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928, carry 0\nSo the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have miscounted the digits. Let me check 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- 4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry 0\n- 5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carry 1\n- 9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n- 2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928, carry 0\nSo yes, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify with another method. Let's break down 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, add them up:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\nYes, that matches. So 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me check that because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the inside: Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3)\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nAnd so on. So, each time we add another layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), etc.\n\nSo, from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like nine layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, in my earlier computation, I went up to Layer 9, which was 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but when I started computing, I thought of Layer 1 as the innermost 1+3, which is correct, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, if there are nine layers, then Layer 9 is the outermost one inside the initial 3(...). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again: The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (... nine times ...))). So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I have nine layers, then Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*Layer9=88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute Layer 9 again. Layer8 is 9841, so Layer9 is 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. So, yes, correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing the layers again, maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\n3*29524=88572\n\nYes, all these steps check out. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is small (nine), computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see, for n=1: a1=4, (3^1 -1)/2= (3-1)/2=1, which is not 4. Hmm, maybe my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is a geometric series. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) )=1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}, and so on, until we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0, where a_0 would be some initial term. But in our case, a1=4, which is 1 + 3*1, so perhaps a0=1. Wait, let me see.\n\nIf a1=1 + 3*a0=4, then 3*a0=3, so a0=1. Then, a2=1 + 3*a1=1 + 3*4=13. Similarly, a3=1 + 3*a2=40, etc.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a0=1.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a0=1: 1 = C*3^0 + (-1/2) => 1 = C - 1/2 => C= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches.\n\nn=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo, indeed, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier for Layer9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which confirms that my earlier step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Hmm, that seems like a big number, but let me check if I did each step correctly. Maybe I should verify each layer's computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

So, it seems each step is correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, maybe, because each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me see if that approach works. The expression inside the outermost parentheses is Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*Layer 8, and so on. So, this is similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might help me compute it without going through each layer. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1). This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n = 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid because both the iterative method and the closed-form formula give the same result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me try to find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have n layers. Let\u2019s denote the value of the nth layer as a_n. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our problem, we have nine layers, starting from the innermost as layer 1. So n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me try to expand it step by step to see if it forms a geometric series. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). Wait, but that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe I can express E in terms of itself, but I think that might not be straightforward because each layer is a separate term. Alternatively, since I already have the formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and in this case, n=9, so a_9=29524, and then E=3*a_9=88572. So I think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute it again using the formula. 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's correct. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3.

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.

So, I think I've done this correctly. Each layer is built upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like a geometric progression or something similar, but since each term is inside another, it builds up exponentially. I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be represented using a formula for a geometric series, but since each term is nested, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. However, since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), computing each step manually isn't too bad. If there were more layers, I might look for a pattern or a recursive formula to compute it more efficiently. But for now, with nine layers, step-by-step computation works fine. So, to recap, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, I multiply that by 3 to get the final result of 88572. I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because when I multiplied 3 by 29524, I think I made a mistake in breaking it down. Let me try a different approach. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because 29524 * 3 seems like a big number. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error earlier. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1). Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

By systematically computing each layer and applying the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Hmm, same result. Maybe that's correct after all. But let me check using a different method to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by standard multiplication: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression, which we computed as 29524. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula or recognizing a pattern. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 4. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is known, so maybe I can find a closed-form expression and then compute it for n=9. Let's try that. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I can think of this as repeatedly multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to how numbers are built in a base-3 system, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here. Another way to think about it is to recognize that each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but since it's nested, it's more complex. But the recurrence method worked well. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I arrived at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer seems correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But wait, that feels too big. Maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time there's a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), right? Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, my initial calculation is correct. Therefore, the final result should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, let's compute a simpler version with fewer layers. Suppose we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOutermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, computing each step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSimilarly, if I compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) which is four layers, let's see:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nOutermost: 3*(1 + 3*40) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the pattern seems to hold. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, going back to the original problem with nine layers, the calculation seems correct, leading to 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, and so on, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of terms, computing each step is manageable.\n\nBut just to explore, the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4 can be solved. Let's see:\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nGiven that, the innermost layer is layer 1: a_1 =4, and the outermost layer is layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute a_9: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, after double-checking with the recurrence relation formula, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find A and B. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier. So, that seems consistent. Now, the general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same result as before. So, this method also confirms that the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see if that's possible. Starting from the innermost term, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). If I expand this, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). Expanding each layer, we can see that each 1 contributes a term that's multiplied by 3 raised to the power corresponding to its depth. For example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3^0=1. So, the entire expression inside the outermost 3*(...) would be the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k. Then, the total expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). Wait, but that seems a bit different from what I had before. Let me check. The sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is a geometric series formula. So, if we have sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k = (3^9 - 1)/2. But earlier, I had a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Hmm, seems like a discrepancy. Wait, let me clarify. Each layer adds another power of 3. So, when I have 9 layers, the innermost is 3^8, and the outermost is 3^0. So, the sum inside is sum_{k=0}^8 3^k, which is (3^9 - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*(sum_{k=0}^8 3^k) = 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 ) = (3^{10} - 3)/2. But wait, earlier I computed it as 88,572. Let me compute (3^{10} - 3)/2: 3^10=59049, so (59049 - 3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523. Then, 3*29523=88569. Wait, that's different from my previous result of 88,572. Hmm, so now I'm confused because the two methods are giving me slightly different results. Where did I go wrong? Let's check. In the first method, I computed each layer step by step and got Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. In the second method, using the geometric series, I got (3^{10} - 3)/2 = 29523, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,569. These are two different results. There must be a mistake in one of the methods. Let me go back and check the first method. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Let's verify Layer 9 computation: 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. Adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Wait, but 3*9841 is 29,523, and adding 1 gives 29,524. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's correct. Now, in the second method, I thought that the sum inside is sum_{k=0}^8 3^k, but perhaps that's not accurate. Let me see. Let's consider the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each time, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the expression can be represented as 3*(a_9), where a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8. So, it's a recursive relation. The general solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as I found earlier. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with the first method. Therefore, the second method where I thought the sum was (3^{10} - 3)/2 must be incorrect. Why? Because when I expand the expression, it's not exactly a simple geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be written as 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). This seems like it would lead to a sum where each term is multiplied by 3^k, but perhaps starting from k=1 instead of k=0. Let me try expanding the expression step by step to see the pattern. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me try expanding the innermost layers first. Let me define E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. E_2 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. E_3 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Wait, but earlier when I computed Layer 3, I got 40, which is E_3 without the outermost 3. So, perhaps E_n = 3*a_n, where a_n is the nth layer. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as before. Therefore, E_n = 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. So, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. That's exactly the result I got earlier. So, in this case, the total expression E is E_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88,572. Therefore, the correct formula is E_n = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2, where n is the number of layers. In our problem, n=9, so E_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88,572. So, that aligns with both methods. I think earlier when I tried to compute it as (3^{10} - 3)/2, I was mistaken because I didn't account for the outermost multiplication by 3 correctly. Therefore, the correct result is indeed 88,572. To summarize, the problem involves computing a deeply nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By working from the innermost layer outward, either through step-by-step computation or by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series and applying the formula, we arrive at the final result of 88,572. It's a bit tricky because of the many layers, but breaking it down step by step and verifying with different methods helps ensure accuracy.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high. Let me compute 3 * 29524 directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Yeah, that matches. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step again because 88572 seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make an error in the earlier steps. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Maybe that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me compute it using another approach. Alternatively, this expression resembles a geometric series. Let me see if I can represent it as such. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, we have a recursive relation: a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, starting with a_1 = 4. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_1 through a_9: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, same result. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and then finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, same result again. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 3^{10} directly, which is 59049, and then compute (59049 -1)/2 = 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. So, regardless of the method, the answer seems to be consistent. Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value of the innermost expression to be 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, I think my answer is correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me confirm this result without computing each layer manually.\n\nWait a minute, this seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. Let's try to find the closed-form solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so for layer 1, n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor layer 2, n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, so using the closed-form formula, each layer checks out.

Let's count: Starting from the innermost, the first is 1+3, then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a layer. So, from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, I think I did 9 layers, each time computing Layer 1 to Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3. So, yes, 8 layers beyond the innermost 1+3. Wait, no, let me recount. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a layer. So, how many times does 1+3(...) appear? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...), so each parenthesis adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the first opening parenthesis after 3, each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses: After the first 3, there's a (, then inside that, another (, and so on, until the innermost is 1+3. So, how many layers? Let's count the number of times we have 1+3(.... Each time, that's a new layer. Starting from the innermost, 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, moving out, each 1+3(...) adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let's count: 1. ( after 3\n2. ( after 1+3\n3. ( after 1+3\n4. ( after 1+3\n5. ( after 1+3\n6. ( after 1+3\n7. ( after 1+3\n8. ( after 1+3\n9. ( after 1+3\n10. ( after 1+3\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears inside each other. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first layer. Then, each time, it's 1+3*(...), so each layer is a new multiplication. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time we have a 1+3(...), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, moving out, each subsequent 1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, that's Layer 2. Then each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\n3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3\n))))\n\nSo, counting the opening parentheses: There are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, each corresponding to a new layer. So, that means there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Therefore, I should have computed up to Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I only went up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me check: Did I compute 9 layers correctly? Let me recount the layers step by step to make sure I didn't skip any.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, each time computing the next layer by plugging in the previous result. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So, that seems correct. But just to make sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n\nWait, hold on, that seems off. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry over 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carry over 0\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry over 2\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carry over 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 should be:\n\nLet me write it properly:\n\n   2 9 5 2 4\n\u00d7        3\n-----------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carry 0\nSo, writing from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8, 7. Wait, but that would give us 88572. Wait, but when I did it digit by digit, I had:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 \u2192 7, carry 0\n5 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 \u2192 8, carry 0\nThen, since there are no more digits, the carry is 0.\n\nSo, the number is 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me try to compute the entire expression step by step, but this time, instead of computing each layer, I'll try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute it more efficiently.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated application of the operation 1 + 3*(...). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n... and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\nYes, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression, we arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me denote the entire inner expression as x. So, x = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But in this case, x itself is similar to the original expression, but without the outermost 3. Wait, no, actually, the original expression is 3*(...), so perhaps x is equal to the inner expression, which is 1 + 3*(...). Hmm, maybe this approach is a bit more complicated, but let me try.\n\nLet me denote x as the innermost expression: x = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). But in reality, each layer is similar, so x = 1 + 3x. Wait, but that would be true if the expression were infinitely nested, but in our case, it's finite, with 9 layers. So, perhaps this approach isn't directly applicable here. However, for the sake of exploration, let's see what happens if we model it as x = 1 + 3x, which would give x = -1/2, but that doesn't make sense in our context because our layers are finite and positive. So, maybe this approach isn't suitable here.\n\nAlternatively, considering the expression as a finite geometric series, but I'm not sure if that directly applies. However, since we've already computed it using the recurrence relation and verified it with a closed-form formula, I think we're safe with the answer 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify that the expression is a nested set of terms, each being 1 + 3*(previous term).\n2. Recognize that there are 9 layers of nesting, starting from the innermost 1 + 3.\n3. Compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, moving outward.\n4. After computing the 9th layer, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n5. Verify the computations by using a recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression to ensure the result is accurate.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each step and verifying the result, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, but let me check that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me just go back through my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems right. But wait, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3*(...), and inside that, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on. How many times does this happen? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Looking back at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\" before the final closing parentheses. That means there are 9 layers, right? So, Layer 1 is the innermost: 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was correct, and then I multiplied by 3 at the end. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). How would that compute? Let's do it step by step. Innermost Layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, computing directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(13)) = 3(1 + 39) = 3(40) = 120. Correct. So, if I apply the same method to the smaller problem, it works. Therefore, my method seems correct. So, applying it to the original problem, the answer should be 88572.

Hmm, that seems like a big number, but given the multiple layers of multiplication, it might be correct. Let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, let me try another approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let's see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me define a sequence a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the layers go up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9. Let me compute a few terms to see if I can find a pattern. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, that seems consistent. Now, maybe there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, let's compute it using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, a_9 is indeed 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is solid. Both methods, computing step by step and finding a closed-form formula, lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form $1 + 3 \\times$ (previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer up to the ninth layer. Finally, we multiply the ninth layer's result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Computation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. **Layer 2:** $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n3. **Layer 3:** $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n4. **Layer 4:** $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n5. **Layer 5:** $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364$\n6. **Layer 6:** $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093$\n7. **Layer 7:** $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280$\n8. **Layer 8:** $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841$\n9. **Layer 9:** $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000 * 3 = 27000 800 * 3 = 2400 40 * 3 = 120 1 * 3 = 3 Now, adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 29400 + 120 = 29520 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, Layer 8 is 9841, which is 1 + 3*3280. Let me verify Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Hmm, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers because maybe I miscounted. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds another layer. So, let's count:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first layer, then each next 1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of layers. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nThe entire expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct. But let me verify each layer's computation because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic with so many layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, multiply Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = ?\n\nLet me compute this more carefully:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are growing so quickly. Let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9, which is the innermost layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln.\n\nThe recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nGiven Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1.\n\nAssume the solution is Ln = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1, L1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nLn = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to represent the entire expression as a single formula.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous, starting from 1 + 3.\n\nAs we found, each layer n can be expressed as (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for 9 layers, the innermost is Layer 1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nThen Layer 2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, which is correct.\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9: (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using recurrence relations to find the value of the innermost layer, then multiply by 3.\n\n4. Verify the computations to ensure accuracy.\n\nI think that covers it. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the innermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because these numbers get big quickly, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Now, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this more carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yep, that's consistent. So, I think my calculation is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, especially since there are nine layers. Let me see if I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: Layer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for this. The general form for such a recurrence is Layer n = a * r^(n) + b, where r is the common ratio and b is a constant term. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation: Layer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. Let's write the first few terms to see the pattern: Layer 1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1 (Wait, no, Layer 1 is just 1 + 3, which is 4) Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. That is, Layer n = 3*Layer (n-1) + 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3*Layer (n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Layer n^(h) = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Layer n^(p) = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, since we have Layer 9, which is the innermost layer, but wait, in our original problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and we have 9 layers in total. Wait, actually, in our initial breakdown, Layer 1 was the innermost, so the outermost layer would be Layer 9, which is multiplied by 3. So, Layer 9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without manually calculating each layer. That's more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step calculation and the formula approach led me to the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.
