    "text": " Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have messed up the carryover. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it as 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer1: 1+3=4. Layer2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step might be faster. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but here it's nested. Let me think about how such a nested expression can be represented. If I denote each layer as a_i, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{i+1} = 1 + 3*a_i, then a_9 is the innermost expression, and the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, starting with a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Each a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the method for linear recurrences. In this case, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows applying a formula to find the solution efficiently. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 =4. So, solving this recurrence relation might give a general formula, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} =0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p =1 + 3*a_p \u2192 a_p -3a_p=1 \u2192 -2a_p=1 \u2192 a_p= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 =3A -1/2 \u2192 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the inside out. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation approach, we find that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. Evaluating up to the ninth layer gives 29524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster or reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 =4. L_2=1 +3*L1=1 +12=13. L_3=1 +3*L2=1 +39=40. And so on. I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1, L1=4= A*3^1 + B =3A + B. For n=0, if I consider L0, it would be 1, since if there were no layers, it's just 1. So L0=1= A*3^0 + B =A + B. So we have two equations: 1) 3A + B =4 2) A + B =1 Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1: 2A =3, so A=3/2. Then from equation 2: 3/2 + B=1, so B= -1/2. Therefore, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's exactly what I got earlier. So that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's the answer. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, we can model it as 3*(L9), where L9=(3^{10}-1)/2. So, the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find each layer's value using the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Using a closed-form formula, we determine the innermost layer (Layer 1) and work outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

    "text": " Wait, maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let me do that: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, I think the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem from a different angle to see if I get the same result. Another way to look at this is to recognize that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, starting from the innermost layer, each step is 1 + 3 times the previous result. Since there are nine layers, each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, nine times. Wait, but in our case, we started with 1 + 3, which is the innermost, and built up to nine layers. Alternatively, maybe this can be represented as a geometric series or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that.\n\nSuppose we define each layer as a_i, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThis pattern continues up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, using the closed-form solution, a_9 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds. Let's say, for n=5, a_5 should be 364.\n\nFrom n=4: a_4=121\n\na_5=1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works.\n\nAnother check: n=6: a_6=1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my approach is solid. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step method and the closed-form solution gave me the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

But let me double-check all my layers because if I made a mistake in one of the layers, the whole answer would be off. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but when I labeled the layers, Layer 9 was the innermost one. Wait no, actually, the innermost is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer wraps around, so Layer 9 is the outermost. So, when I compute Layer 9, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then I multiply by 3. So yes, 3*29524 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is layer 9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9=29524, so the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Adding units place: 8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 4 + 2 = 6 +1=7, write down 7. 0 +5=5, write down 5. 9 +9=18, write down 8, carry over 1. 5 +2=7 +1=8, write down 8. 2 + nothing=2. So, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me recompute each layer step by step to check for any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 (correct) Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 (correct) Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 (correct) Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 (correct) Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 (correct) Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 (correct) Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 (correct) Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in n=1: a_1=4= A*3 + B. Also, the homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation and a derived formula, the innermost value is found to be 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the innermost outward**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

I think I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and each step logically follows from the previous one. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or use a formula if this is a geometric series or something similar, but given that each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term, it might follow a specific recurrence relation. Let me think about that for a moment.\n\nIf I let a_n represent the value of the nth layer, then each layer can be defined as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWith a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving the recurrence relation:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nTo find a particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier layers:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same values for each layer. That gives me even more confidence that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the innermost layer (Layer 9) is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives the final result:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying using a different method (the recurrence relation), I'm certain that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my earlier layers because I might have made a mistake in the computation of each layer. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3 times the previous. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's also compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the closed-form: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) 9A + B = 13 (from n=2) Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire computation using the closed-form formula. Since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different methods all converge to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Wait, actually, maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let's do that: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. So putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). So, each layer seems correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are growing so quickly. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. But wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers get so big so fast. Let me check the layers again using the formula. For example, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous. So, 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, a_9=(3^10 -1)/2=29524, so 3*a_9=3*(3^10 -1)/2= (3^11 -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, the answer is definitely 88572. I think I've checked it thoroughly, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check for any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). So, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recursive pattern where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can write it as a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c), to find a constant c that makes it a homogeneous recurrence. Let's see: a_n + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. But a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so substituting: 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Simplify: 1 + c = 3c \u21d2 1 = 2c \u21d2 c = 1/2. So, the equation becomes a_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2). Let me define b_n = a_n + 1/2. Then, b_n = 3*b_{n-1}, which is a simple geometric progression with ratio 3. The initial condition is a_1 = 4, so b_1 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, b_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1}. Then, a_n = b_n - 1/2 = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (9/2)*3^{2} - 1/2 = (81/2) - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let me compute that. First, 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Then, (9/2)*6561 = (9*6561)/2. Let's compute 9*6561. 6561*9: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So, 54000 + 4500 = 58500, 58500 + 540 = 59040, 59040 + 9 = 59049. So, (9/2)*6561 = 59049/2 = 29524.5. Then, a_9 = 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. I think that's solid. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After evaluating all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or recognize a pattern that allows me to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding each one isn't too bad. However, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since the coefficients are small, expanding each term is manageable. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a geometric series. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, we find the value of the innermost expression to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.

But wait, I feel like this might be a known sequence or pattern. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for it. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula to see if it aligns with the step-by-step computation.\n\nFor example, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 =29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each layer \\( a_n \\) can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this gives \\( a_9 = 29524 \\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, recursively, each term can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. Wait, but actually, a_1 is 1+3=4. Then a_2=1+3*a1=1+12=13, and so on. So, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is a geometric progression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The solution to this recurrence can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, n=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.

Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, reading it from the top: 8 8 5 7 2, so 88572? Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5.

Let me see: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524: 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, all the layers seem correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we also arrive at the same answer, which confirms that 88572 is correct. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe I can check one of the layers again to be sure. Let's check Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121=363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Sometimes, these can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, starting from a_1 as the innermost, which is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on, up to a_9, which is 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n in such a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. Let's see if I can find a pattern or formula for a_n.\n\nFirst, let's write down the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is roughly 4 times the previous term, but not exactly. Let me check:\n\na_2 / a_1 = 13 / 4 = 3.25\n\na_3 / a_2 = 40 / 13 \u2248 3.0769\n\na_4 / a_3 = 121 / 40 = 3.025\n\na_5 / a_4 = 364 / 121 \u2248 2.999\n\na_6 / a_5 = 1093 / 364 \u2248 3.000\n\nWait, that's interesting. It seems like the ratio approaches 3 as n increases, but for the first few terms, it's slightly different. Maybe this is a converging series, but in this case, since we're only going up to a_9, it's not yet converged.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it without having to manually compute each layer, which is especially helpful if the expression were longer.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. However, it's good to know that a general formula exists for such nested expressions.\n\nIn summary, by working from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each layer step by step, and verifying with a general formula, I arrived at the solution: 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because when I saw the expression, I thought maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could be used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Maybe I can find a general formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form L_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equate coefficients: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. That's a neat formula! Let me check if this works for the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, this formula works perfectly. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula to find L_9 directly. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*(29524) = 88572, as I calculated before. This method is much faster, especially if there were more layers. It's good to recognize such patterns because it can save a lot of time and reduce the chance of making arithmetic errors. So, in summary, by recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, I found a general formula that allows me to compute each layer directly without manually calculating each step. This problem was a good exercise in recognizing patterns and applying recurrence relations. I think I understand it better now. So, the final answer is 88572. I'm confident in this result because both the step-by-step computation and the formula gave me the same answer, and I double-checked each layer as I went along.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, writing it down: 29524 *3: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15 \u21925, carryover1. Next:9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2. Next:2*3=6 +2=8. Next:9*3=27 \u21927, carryover2. Next:5*3=15 +2=17 \u21927, carryover1. Next:2*3=6 +1=7. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that matches.

Wait, but let me check that again because 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. But let me verify my earlier steps because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have simplified this instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's see, the expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let me denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on up to a\u2089. Then the total expression is 3*a\u2089. So, we're computing a\u2089 and then multiplying by 3. Now, is there a formula for such a recursive sequence? The general form is a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a\u2099. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a\u2099 - 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 1. The characteristic equation for the homogeneous part (a\u2099 - 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0) is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3\u207f. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a\u2099 = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a\u2099 = C*3\u207f + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4. So, when n=1, a\u2081 = C*3\u00b9 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms to make sure it's correct. For n=1: a\u2081 = (3\u00b2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a\u2082 = (3\u00b3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a\u2083=(3\u2074 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a\u2084=(3\u2075 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 -1)/2. So, for n=9, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2. Let me compute 3\u00b9\u2070. 3\u00b9=3, 3\u00b2=9, 3\u00b3=27, 3\u2074=81, 3\u2075=243, 3\u2076=729, 3\u2077=2187, 3\u2078=6561, 3\u2079=19683, 3\u00b9\u2070=59049. So, a\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step and then verifying with a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can spot another way to approach this problem. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier values to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's another way to compute this without expanding each layer. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are nine layers, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think. Starting from the innermost layer, each step is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, if I denote the innermost term as 1 + 3 = 4, then the next term is 1 + 3*4 =13, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3). The next term is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. So, in general, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, after n layers, the term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. As we saw earlier, this leads to a geometric progression with a ratio of 3 and a particular solution. But maybe I can express this as a sum. Let me try to unroll the expression. Let's see, starting from the innermost term: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\nWait a minute, this looks like the sum of a geometric series. Let's see:\n\na_1 = 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1\n\na_2 = 13 = 3^3 + 3^1 + 1 = 27 + 3 +1? Wait, no, 27 + 3 +1 is 31, which is not 13.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me write down the terms:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121\n\nWait, so each a_n is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 3^{n} ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\na_1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\n\na_2 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\n\na_3 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\na_4 = 121 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}\n\nWhich is a geometric series with first term 1, ratio 3, and n+1 terms.\n\nWait, but for a_1, we have 1 + 3^1 = 4, which is 2 terms.\n\na_2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 3 terms.\n\nSo, a_n has (n+1) terms, from 3^0 up to 3^n.\n\nBut wait, in our earlier formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this against the sum formula.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series with first term 1, ratio 3, and (n+1) terms is S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches our earlier result. So, indeed, a_n is equal to the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, another way to compute it is by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series and using the formula for the sum, which gives the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as repeatedly applying the operation of multiplying by 3 and adding 1, starting from 1. Let's see:\n\nStarting with x = 1\n\nThen, x = 1 + 3*1 = 4\n\nThen, x = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nThen, x = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to nine times. Wait, but actually, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from the innermost, we have to do this operation nine times, and then multiply by 3.\n\nBut since we've already established that each a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and we're doing this nine times, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiply by 3, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, another way to look at it is that the entire expression is (3^{11} - 3)/2, which equals 88572.\n\nThis is because each time we have a term like 1 + 3*(...), it's equivalent to adding 1 and then scaling by 3, which over multiple layers leads to a geometric progression where each term is a power of 3.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method I use\u2014whether expanding each layer step by step, recognizing the recurrence relation, or using the geometric series formula\u2014I arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and all methods converge to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3 * 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Continue expanding each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3 * 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3 * 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3 * 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3 * 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3 * 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3 * 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3 * 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n4. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. Hmm, maybe I should compute 3 * 29524 directly. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, putting it all together: 6 8 5 8 2. Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 2*3=6. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let's do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStart from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carryover.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nFinally, the leftmost digit: 2 * 3 = 6. So, the number is 6 8 8 5 7 2? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me count the digits:\n\n29524 has 5 digits. Multiplying by 3, which is a single digit, could result in up to 6 digits if there's a carryover in the highest digit. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, no carryover.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, no carryover.\nFinally, the leftmost digit: there's no more digits, but we have a carryover? Wait, no, the leftmost digit is 2, which we've already multiplied. So, the result is 88572. Let me confirm with another method: 29524 \u00d7 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, add them up:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check because I think I might have made a mistake earlier when computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression, which is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but I'm wondering if there's a pattern or a formula that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Because 3*3^{10} = 3^{11}, and 3*1=3.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That confirms the result again. So, regardless of whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this result. After computing all layers, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to obtain the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the layers because I might have made a mistake earlier when computing the layers. Let's go through each layer again to make sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121.

Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recursive sequence.\n\nIn general, for such expressions, each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*4=13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, and so on, which is exactly what I computed earlier.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2= (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nIn this case, n=9, so 3*a_9= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then realized there's a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation, found the general formula, and confirmed that it matches the step-by-step computation. So I'm pretty confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with n layers. In this case, n=9. Maybe there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for this. Let me try to find a pattern. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our case, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524)=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since the original expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to look at it. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Alternatively, maybe I should do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, that seems too long. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of digits. Let me count the digits in 29524: it's a 5-digit number. So, when I multiply by 3, the result should be:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that's only 5 digits, but when I multiply 29524 by 3, it's 88572. Let me confirm with a calculator approach:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer again to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since I already did it step by step, and the result seems consistent, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I might have made an error in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach to see if I get the same result. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define the layers more formally. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88,572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3*29,524 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the recurrence relation L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Solving this recurrence, we find that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, this gives us 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote the nth term as a_n. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the sequence is defined by a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few terms. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, and the 1s are the common ratio. But in this case, it's a finite series, so the formula I used earlier applies. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of this sequence, we compute the innermost layers step by step, leading to the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.
