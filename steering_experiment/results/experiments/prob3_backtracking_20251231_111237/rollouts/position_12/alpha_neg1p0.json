    "text": " This looks like a recursive structure, where each layer depends on the one inside it. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one. Let's try that approach. I'll start from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), then move outward, each time substituting the computed value back into the expression. Let me write down each step as I go along.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses: (1 + 3)**\n   Okay, the very innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward.\n   So, 1 + 3 = 4.\n   Now, this result will be used in the next layer out.\n\n2. **Next Layer: 3*(result from above)**\n   The next layer is 3*(1 + 3). Wait, but I just computed (1 + 3) as 4, so this becomes 3*4.\n   Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12.\n   So, this layer simplifies to 12.\n\n3. **Next Layer: 1 + (result from above)**\n   Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + [previous result]. The previous result was 12, so this becomes 1 + 12.\n   Computing that: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n4. **Next Layer: 3*(result from above)**\n   The next layer is 3*(1 + 3(...)), which now becomes 3*13.\n   Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39.\n\n5. **Next Layer: 1 + (result from above)**\n   Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 39.\n   That's easy: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n6. **Next Layer: 3*(result from above)**\n   Next up is 3*40.\n   Calculating that: 3*40 = 120.\n\n7. **Next Layer: 1 + (result from above)**\n   Now, 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n8. **Next Layer: 3*(result from above)**\n   Then, 3*121 = 363.\n\n9. **Next Layer: 1 + (result from above)**\n   Adding 1 to 363 gives us 364.\n\n10. **Next Layer: 3*(result from above)**\n    Now, 3*364. Hmm, let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so adding those together: 900 + 192 = 1092.\n\n11. **Next Layer: 1 + (result from above)**\n    So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n12. **Next Layer: 3*(result from above)**\n    Then, 3*1093. Let me break that down: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\n13. **Next Layer: 1 + (result from above)**\n    Now, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n14. **Next Layer: 3*(result from above)**\n    Then, 3*3280. Let's compute that: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840.\n\n15. **Next Layer: 1 + (result from above)**\n    So, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n16. **Next Layer: 3*(result from above)**\n    Finally, 3*9841. Let me calculate this: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that calculation again because 3*9841 might not be 29523. Let me compute 9841*3 properly:\n\n- 9000*3 = 27000\n- 800*3 = 2400\n- 40*3 = 120\n- 1*3 = 3\n\nAdding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait a second, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me recount how many layers I have to compute. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, each time I compute a layer, I'm effectively moving one step outward. Let me count how many times I've computed so far:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*4 = 12\n3. 1 + 12 = 13\n4. 3*13 = 39\n5. 1 + 39 = 40\n6. 3*40 = 120\n7. 1 + 120 = 121\n8. 3*121 = 363\n9. 1 + 363 = 364\n10. 3*364 = 1092\n11. 1 + 1092 = 1093\n12. 3*1093 = 3279\n13. 1 + 3279 = 3280\n14. 3*3280 = 9840\n15. 1 + 9840 = 9841\n16. 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, that's 16 steps, but the original expression only has nine layers. Maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time I compute a layer, I'm moving one step out. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each step out adds another 3*(...). So, perhaps the number of computations is equal to the number of layers. Let me see:\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step out adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n10. (1 + 3\n\nWait, that seems like 10 opening parentheses, but the last one is just (1 + 3, without another parenthesis. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression carefully. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outside:\n\n- The outermost is 3*(...).\n- Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...).\n- Inside that, another 1 + 3*(...).\n- This continues until the innermost part, which is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur? Let's count:\n\nStarting from the first opening parenthesis after 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n10. (1 + 3\n\nWait, that's 10 opening parentheses, but the last one doesn't have a closing parenthesis because it's just (1 + 3). So, actually, the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is the 10th layer? But that can't be because when I started computing, I only went through 9 layers. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears, which is 9 times. Let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of \"1 + 3(\" sequences:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n\nSo, that's 9 times. So, each \"1 + 3(\" is a layer, and the innermost is (1 + 3). Therefore, there are 9 layers. So, I should have 9 computations starting from the innermost. But when I did the computations earlier, I ended up with 16 steps. That suggests I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer consists of two steps: first computing the inner expression, then multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, for each layer, I have two operations. Let me try again, but this time keeping track of each layer.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12; then 1 + Layer2 = 13\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer1). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer1). Therefore, after computing Layer1 as 29524, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me clarify the layers. If Layer1 is the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then Layer2 is 1 + 3*Layer1, and so on, until Layer9 is the outermost layer, which is 1 + 3*Layer8. But then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). Hmm, maybe I messed up the layer numbering earlier.\n\nLet me try again, this time numbering the layers correctly. Let's define the innermost as Layer1, then each subsequent layer is built outward.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, compute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000*3 = 60000\n- 9000*3 = 27000\n- 500*3 = 1500\n- 20*3 = 60\n- 4*3 = 12\n\nAdding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524*3 should be 88572. Let me check with another method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing step by step, I ended up with 29523, but that was before multiplying by the outermost 3. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps by not correctly identifying the number of layers.\n\nLet me confirm by working from the inside out again, but this time keeping track of each layer correctly.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Layer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Layer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Layer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Layer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Layer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Layer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I thought the final result was 29523, but that was before multiplying by the outermost 3. So, the correct final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually stepping through each layer, which could be error-prone.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form solution, I also get 88572 as the final result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think earlier when I was computing step by step, I might have stopped one layer too soon, not realizing that after computing the 9th layer, I still had to multiply by the outermost 3. So, that's why I initially thought it was 29523, but that was just the value before the final multiplication.\n\nAnother way to see it is that each layer is building up the value, and the outermost 3 multiplies the entire structure. So, it's essential to remember that the final step is to multiply the result of the 9th layer by 3.\n\nTo double-check, let me compute the expression step by step again, making sure I include the outermost multiplication.\n\n1. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form solution.\n\nI think I've got it now. The key was to recognize the pattern, compute each layer step by step, and then remember to multiply the final result by 3 to get the overall answer. It's easy to stop one step too soon and forget that last multiplication, but with the closed-form solution, I can confirm that the result is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer outward. \n\n1. **Innermost layer**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. **Next layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. **Next layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\).\n4. **Next layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\).\n5. **Next layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\).\n6. **Next layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\).\n7. **Next layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\).\n8. **Next layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\).\n9. **Next layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " That suggests that I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one, and then work my way outwards. Let me try to represent this as a series of steps. Let's denote each nested part as follows: Let\u2019s say, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous result)), and so on. Hmm, maybe I can represent this as a recursive expression or use substitution. Alternatively, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try the step-by-step approach. I'll start by computing the innermost expression and work my way out. Let's label each layer for clarity. Let me assign variables to each nested expression to keep track. Let\u2019s say:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- A = 1 + 3\n- B = 1 + 3*A\n- C = 1 + 3*B\n- D = 1 + 3*C\n- E = 1 + 3*D\n- F = 1 + 3*E\n- G = 1 + 3*F\n- H = 1 + 3*G\n- I = 1 + 3*H\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*I.\n\nWait, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each time we have 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It seems like there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, that would mean we have 9 layers, each time adding a 1 and multiplying by 3. So, perhaps my variables A to I correspond to each layer, with A being the innermost. So, A = 1 + 3, then B = 1 + 3*A, and so on up to I, and then the entire expression is 3*I. That seems correct. So, let's compute each layer step by step. Let me compute A first.\n\nA = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, moving out one layer, we have B = 1 + 3*A. Since A is 4, B = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, moving on to C. C = 1 + 3*B. B is 13, so C = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext, D = 1 + 3*C. C is 40, so D = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nThen, E = 1 + 3*D. D is 121, so E = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nProceeding to F. F = 1 + 3*E. E is 364, so F = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so total is 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, F = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nMoving on to G. G = 1 + 3*F. F is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me compute that: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so total is 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So, G = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext, H = 1 + 3*G. G is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So, H = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nThen, I = 1 + 3*H. H is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So, I = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*I, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Let me add these up step by step. Starting with 60000 + 27000 = 87000. Then, 87000 + 1500 = 88500. Next, 88500 + 60 = 88560. Finally, 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's go back through each step.\n\nStarting with A: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nB: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nC: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nD: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE: 1 + 3*121. 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nF: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080+12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nG: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nH: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nI: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*I: 3*29524. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the total is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing it another way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 by breaking it down differently.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss any steps. I started from the innermost parentheses, computed each layer step by step, substituting the value of each into the next layer. Each time, it was a matter of multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. I did this for each of the nine layers, which led me to the final result of 88,572 when I multiplied the outermost 3 by the innermost expression. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each nested expression as follows:\n\n- Let \\( A = 1 + 3 \\)\n- Let \\( B = 1 + 3A \\)\n- Let \\( C = 1 + 3B \\)\n- Let \\( D = 1 + 3C \\)\n- Let \\( E = 1 + 3D \\)\n- Let \\( F = 1 + 3E \\)\n- Let \\( G = 1 + 3F \\)\n- Let \\( H = 1 + 3G \\)\n- Let \\( I = 1 + 3H \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3I \\).\n\nNow, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Compute \\( A \\):\n   \\[ A = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Compute \\( B \\):\n   \\[ B = 1 + 3A = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Compute \\( C \\):\n   \\[ C = 1 + 3B = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Compute \\( D \\):\n   \\[ D = 1 + 3C = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Compute \\( E \\):\n   \\[ E = 1 + 3D = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Compute \\( F \\):\n   \\[ F = 1 + 3E = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7.

    "text": " This seems like a recursive structure, where each layer depends on the one inside it. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one. Let's try that. Let me denote each layer as follows: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. Starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3*(something). Wait, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Because it's the innermost parentheses. Let me check: The innermost parentheses is 1 + 3, so that's 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(4). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result of the previous layer), and so on until I get to the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3. Let me write this down step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, that's one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, I think I have nine layers in total. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after computing each layer, the outermost expression is Layer 9, which is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, I need to multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition.\n\nLet me verify each layer again:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is calculated correctly by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them step by step:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut in our case, we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9. Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, actually, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nUsing the formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nPlugging n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, indeed, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the calculations, and both methods confirm the same answer. So, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using this recursive relation, we compute each layer up to the ninth, which gives us 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That was simple enough. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

    "text": " That suggests that this is a recursive-like structure, where each layer depends on the next. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which was 13. So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Next layer out is 1 + 3*40. Let's see: 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, this is increasing rapidly. Next, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate that: 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, now we're at 364.

Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 +9=3279. Then, add 1: 3279 +1=3280. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280.

Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 +2400=29400, 29400 +120=29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then, add 1: 29523 +1=29524. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 +27000=87000, 87000 +1500=88500, 88500 +60=88560, 88560 +12=88572. Then, add 1: 88572 +1=88573. So, now we're at 88573. Next layer out: 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute 3*88573. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 240000 +24000=264000, 264000 +1500=265500, 265500 +210=265710, 265710 +9=265719. Then, add 1: 265719 +1=265720. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*265720. Let's compute 3*265720. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding those together: 600000 +180000=780000, 780000 +15000=795000, 795000 +2100=797100, 797100 +60=797160. Then, add 1: 797160 +1=797161. So, now we're at 797161. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*797161. Let me compute 3*797161. 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 2100000 +270000=2370000, 2370000 +21000=2391000, 2391000 +300=2391300, 2391300 +180=2391480, 2391480 +3=2391483. Then, add 1: 2391483 +1=2391484. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*2391484. Let's compute 3*2391484. 2000000*3=6000000, 300000*3=900000, 90000*3=270000, 1000*3=3000, 400*3=1200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 6000000 +900000=6900000, 6900000 +270000=7170000, 7170000 +3000=7173000, 7173000 +1200=7174200, 7174200 +240=7174440, 7174440 +12=7174452. Then, add 1: 7174452 +1=7174453. So, now we're at 7174453. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*7174453. Let me compute 3*7174453. 7000000*3=21000000, 100000*3=300000, 70000*3=210000, 4000*3=12000, 400*3=1200, 50*3=150, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 21000000 +300000=21300000, 21300000 +210000=21510000, 21510000 +12000=21522000, 21522000 +1200=21523200, 21523200 +150=21523350, 21523350 +9=21523359. Then, add 1: 21523359 +1=21523360. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*21523360. Let's compute 3*21523360. 20000000*3=60000000, 1000000*3=3000000, 500000*3=1500000, 20000*3=60000, 3000*3=9000, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 0*3=0. Adding those together: 60000000 +3000000=63000000, 63000000 +1500000=64500000, 64500000 +60000=64560000, 64560000 +9000=64569000, 64569000 +900=64570900, 64570900 +180=64571080, 64571080 +0=64571080. Then, add 1: 64571080 +1=64571081. So, now we're at 64571081. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*64571081. Let me compute 3*64571081. 60000000*3=180000000, 4000000*3=12000000, 500000*3=1500000, 70000*3=210000, 1000*3=3000, 800*3=2400, 10*3=30, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 180000000 +12000000=192000000, 192000000 +1500000=193500000, 193500000 +210000=193710000, 193710000 +3000=193713000, 193713000 +2400=193715400, 193715400 +30=193715430, 193715430 +3=193715433. Then, add 1: 193715433 +1=193715434. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*193715434. Let me compute 3*193715434. 100000000*3=300000000, 90000000*3=270000000, 30000000*3=90000000, 7000000*3=21000000, 100000*3=300000, 50000*3=150000, 4000*3=12000, 300*3=900, 40*3=120, 3*3=9. Wait, hold on, maybe I should break it down more carefully. Let me compute 193,715,434 *3. Let's do it step by step:\n\n193,715,434 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n3*3=9 +1=10, write down 0, carry over 1.\n\n4*3=12 +1=13, write down 3, carry over 1.\n\n5*3=15 +1=16, write down 6, carry over 1.\n\n1*3=3 +1=4, write down 4.\n\n7*3=21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3*3=9 +2=11, write down 1, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n1*3=3 +2=5, write down 5.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 581,146,302.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\nWait, 193,715,434 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n3*3=9 +1=10, write 0, carry 1.\n\n4*3=12 +1=13, write 3, carry 1.\n\n5*3=15 +1=16, write 6, carry 1.\n\n1*3=3 +1=4, write 4.\n\n7*3=21, write 1, carry 2.\n\n3*3=9 +2=11, write 1, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n1*3=3 +2=5, write 5.\n\nSo, reading from left to right: 5 8 1 1 4 6 3 0 2. Wait, that would be 581,146,302. Hmm, let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 193,715,434 *3 can be calculated as:\n\n193,715,434 *3 = (190,000,000 + 3,715,434) *3 = 190,000,000*3 + 3,715,434*3.\n\n190,000,000*3 = 570,000,000.\n\n3,715,434*3: 3,000,000*3=9,000,000; 700,000*3=2,100,000; 15,000*3=45,000; 434*3=1,302.\n\nSo, 9,000,000 +2,100,000=11,100,000; 11,100,000 +45,000=11,145,000; 11,145,000 +1,302=11,146,302.\n\nNow, add that to 570,000,000: 570,000,000 +11,146,302=581,146,302. Okay, that matches. So, 193,715,434 *3=581,146,302.\n\nThen, add 1: 581,146,302 +1=581,146,303.\n\nSo, now we're at 581,146,303.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(all that). So, after computing the innermost parentheses and working out, we end up with 581,146,303, and then we have to multiply that by 3, right?\n\nWait, let me double-check the structure of the original problem.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, after computing all the inner layers, we get to 581,146,303, and then we have to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, 3*581,146,303.\n\nLet me compute that: 500,000,000*3=1,500,000,000; 80,000,000*3=240,000,000; 1,000,000*3=3,000,000; 146,303*3=438,909.\n\nWait, let me break it down properly.\n\n581,146,303 *3:\n\n500,000,000*3=1,500,000,000\n\n80,000,000*3=240,000,000\n\n1,000,000*3=3,000,000\n\n146,303*3=438,909\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n1,500,000,000 +240,000,000=1,740,000,000\n\n1,740,000,000 +3,000,000=1,743,000,000\n\n1,743,000,000 +438,909=1,743,438,909\n\nSo, the final result is 1,743,438,909.\n\nWait, let me confirm that:\n\n581,146,303 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3*3=9\n\n0*3=0\n\n3*3=9\n\n0*3=0\n\n6*3=18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n4*3=12 +1=13, write down 3, carry over 1.\n\n1*3=3 +1=4\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n1*3=3 +1=4\n\n8*3=24, write down 4, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\nThere's nothing left, so write down 1.\n\nWait, but that seems off. Let me actually compute it digit by digit:\n\n581,146,303\n\n*          3\n\n------------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n3*3=9\n\n0*3=0\n\n3*3=9\n\n0*3=0\n\n6*3=18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n4*3=12 +1=13, write down 3, carry over 1.\n\n1*3=3 +1=4\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n1*3=3 +1=4\n\n8*3=24, write down 4, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\nSince we're at the leftmost digit, we write down 1.\n\nSo, putting it together: 1 7 4 3 4 3 8 9 0 9.\n\nWait, that would be 1,743,438,909. Which matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, yes, 581,146,303 *3=1,743,438,909.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 1,743,438,909.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my steps because this number seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Let me recount how many layers I had to compute.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3)=4, then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous result). I counted 9 layers, right? Let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)=4\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4=13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13=40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40=121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121=364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364=1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524=88573\n\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573=265720\n\n12. Next: 1 + 3*265720=797161\n\n13. Next: 1 + 3*797161=2391484\n\n14. Next: 1 + 3*2391484=7174453\n\n15. Next: 1 + 3*7174453=21523360\n\n16. Next: 1 + 3*21523360=64571081\n\n17. Next: 1 + 3*64571081=193715434\n\n18. Next: 1 + 3*193715434=581,146,303\n\n19. Finally, multiply by 3: 581,146,303*3=1,743,438,909\n\nWait, so actually, I think I miscounted earlier. Let me check the structure again. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers to compute before multiplying by the outermost 3. Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...)) is a layer. Let me count the number of times I see a \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 1+3(...), so that's 2.\n3. Continuing, I see that each time there's a 1+3(, so let's count:\n\n- After the first 3, there's 1+3(...), which is layer 1.\n- Inside that, another 1+3(...), layer 2.\n- Continuing until the innermost, which is layer 9.\n\nSo, total layers inside the outermost 3 are 9. So, starting from the innermost, I computed 9 layers, each time moving outward, and then after the 9th layer, I had to multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I ended up with 581,146,303 after 18 layers, which seems too many. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the layers. Let's parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*(88573) = 265720\n12. Next: 1 + 3*(265720) = 797161\n13. Next: 1 + 3*(797161) = 2391484\n14. Next: 1 + 3*(2391484) = 7174453\n15. Next: 1 + 3*(7174453) = 21523360\n16. Next: 1 + 3*(21523360) = 64571081\n17. Next: 1 + 3*(64571081) = 193715434\n18. Next: 1 + 3*(193715434) = 581146303\n19. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*(581146303) = 1743438909\n\nWait, so I think I miscounted earlier. The original expression has 9 layers inside the outermost 3, but in my computation, I ended up with 18 layers because I started counting from the innermost as layer 1, then each subsequent as another layer. So, actually, the number of layers is 9 inside the outermost 3, meaning I should have 9 computations before multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the expression is 3*(layer1), where layer1 is 1 + 3*(layer2), layer2 is 1 + 3*(layer3), ..., layer9 is 1 + 3*(layer10), but wait, no, the innermost is layer9: (1+3). So, actually, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3, meaning I have to compute 9 layers starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a nested expression. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 1+3(...), so that's 2.\n3. Continuing, I see that each time there's a 1+3(, so let's count:\n\n- After the first 3, there's 1+3(...), which is layer 1.\n- Inside that, another 1+3(...), layer 2.\n- Continuing until the innermost, which is layer 9.\n\nSo, total layers inside the outermost 3 are 9. Therefore, starting from the innermost, which is layer9: (1+3)=4, then layer8: 1 + 3*4=13, layer7: 1 + 3*13=40, layer6:1 + 3*40=121, layer5:1 + 3*121=364, layer4:1 + 3*364=1093, layer3:1 + 3*1093=3280, layer2:1 + 3*3280=9841, layer1:1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, layer1 is 29524, and then the outermost 3*(29524)=88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*(29524)=88572, which is way smaller than the 1.7 billion I got earlier. So, I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me try to count the number of parentheses.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a nested expression. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) - first opening parenthesis\n2. Inside that, another (1+3(...)) - second opening parenthesis\n3. Continuing until the innermost, which is (1+3), so that's the ninth opening parenthesis.\n\nSo, total layers are 9. Therefore, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3)=4, then layer8:1 + 3*4=13, layer7:1 + 3*13=40, layer6:1 + 3*40=121, layer5:1 + 3*121=364, layer4:1 + 3*364=1093, layer3:1 + 3*1093=3280, layer2:1 + 3*3280=9841, layer1:1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that's a very different result than before. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) - first opening parenthesis\n2. Inside that, another (1+3(...)) - second opening parenthesis\n3. Continuing until the innermost, which is (1+3), so that's the ninth opening parenthesis.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that would mean the final answer is 88,572, which is way smaller than my earlier 1.7 billion. So, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nAh, I think I miscounted the number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers inside the outermost 3, so I should have only 9 computations before multiplying by 3. In my earlier computation, I went beyond that, which was incorrect.\n\nSo, let's correct that. Let's compute each layer properly:\n\nLayer9 (innermost): (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer4: 1 + "

    "text": " That suggests that I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try to label each layer to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start by computing Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Calculating 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, and 3*1 is 3, so 300 + 60 + 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify that. Each time I computed a layer, I did the multiplication and addition correctly. Let me double-check a couple of the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For example, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute that again just to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I did each step correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of operations.

Let's say: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the next one. Starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. Then, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(previous term), and so on. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try to write this out:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times the entire expression, right? So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, I think I need to compute Layer 9 first, which is 29524, and then multiply that by 3. Let me check that.\n\nSo, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's break it down.\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, 29524 is 29,524. So, 3 * 29,524.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n*       3\n--------\nFirst, 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that because sometimes when you do mental math, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me add 29,524 three times:\n\n29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048\n\n59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total value is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\n1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems solid. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer.\n\nWait, the expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))))\n\nWhich can be thought of as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers.\n\nThis looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can model it as such.\n\nIn general, if you have a nested expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))) with n layers, it's similar to a geometric series.\n\nIn our case, a=1, b=3, and n=9 layers.\n\nThe formula for such a nested expression is (b^(n+1) - 1)/(b - 1). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. If you have x = 1 + b*x, then x = (1)/(1 - b), but that's for an infinite series. But in our case, it's finite, so the formula is different.\n\nWait, let me try to model it. Let's define x_k as the value at layer k.\n\nSo, x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nx_2 = 1 + 3*x_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nx_3 =1 +3*x_2=1 +3*13=40\n\nAnd so on, up to x_9.\n\nSo, each x_k =1 +3*x_{k-1}\n\nSo, the general formula for x_k is x_k = 1 + 3*x_{k-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is x_k = A*3^k + C, where C is a constant.\n\nTo find C, let's solve the recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is x_k^h = A*3^k.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume x_k^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is x_k = A*3^k -1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When k=1, x_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is x_k = (3/2)*3^k -1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{k+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, x_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for k=9, x_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, x_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, x_9=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*x_9=3*29524=88,572\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula for the nth term of the recurrence, which is x_k=(3^{k+1}-1)/2, so for k=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nThis method is faster and avoids computing each layer step by step, which is especially useful if the number of layers is large. But since we only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Define each layer as follows:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n2. The entire expression is 3 times the value of Layer 9:\n   - Compute \\(3 \\times 29524\\):\n     - \\(29524 \\times 3 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " That suggests that I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me label each layer from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9 to keep track of them. Wait, actually, looking again, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way out, computing each layer one by one. Let me try that approach. Let's start with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: (1 + 3) That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29000 is 87000, 3*524 is 1572. So, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me just verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, which might help confirm the answer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is a function of the previous one. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recursive sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence relation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13, which is correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40, which is correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've solved it correctly. The key was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or finding a closed-form formula to compute the innermost layers more efficiently. Either way, both approaches led me to the same answer, so I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " That suggests that I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part and moving outward. Let me try to number these layers for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. That seems manageable. Let me start computing each layer step by step. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. So, Layer 1 equals 4. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13 gives 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, that's a bit bigger. Let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an error when dealing with large numbers. Let me verify Layer 9 again: 3*(Layer 8) where Layer 8 is 9841. 3*9841: Let's compute it as (9000 + 800 + 40 + 1)*3 = 9000*3 + 800*3 + 40*3 + 1*3 = 27000 + 2400 + 120 + 3 = 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is indeed 29524. So, that's correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60,000; 9000*3 = 27,000; 500*3 = 1,500; 20*3 = 60; 4*3 = 12. Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. That seems correct. Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute 29524*3 another way. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier, let me go through the layers again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so all the layers check out. I think my answer is correct. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer one by one:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3. Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4. Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5. Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6. Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is... Let me compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9.

So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we have 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12.

So, 3*29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that multiplication because that seems like a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me verify 29524*3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the right, the digits are 2,7,5,7,7,5,7,2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over = 7. Write down 7, no carryover.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15.

Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, plus 2 carried over = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over = 7. Write down 7, no carryover.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, we have 7 (from the 2), then 7, 5, 7, 7, 5, 7, and 2. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should write it vertically:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   \u00d7        3\n   -----------\n     8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, let's compute each digit step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. So, write 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7. Write 7, no carryover.\n- Hundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7. Write 7, no carryover.\n- Ten-thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write 7, carry over 2.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, plus 2 = 17.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 \u00d7 3 should be 88572, which is 88,572. Let me check: 29,524 \u00d7 3. 29,524 \u00d7 3: 20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000; 9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000; 500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500; 20 \u00d7 3 = 60; 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I computed Layer 9 correctly because that seems like a big number. Let me go back through each layer and verify my calculations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 \u00d7 3. 1000 \u00d7 3 = 3000, 90 \u00d7 3 = 270, 3 \u00d7 3 = 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280 \u00d7 3. 3000 \u00d7 3 = 9000, 200 \u00d7 3 = 600, 80 \u00d7 3 = 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841 \u00d7 3. 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000; 800 \u00d7 3 = 2,400; 40 \u00d7 3 = 120; 1 \u00d7 3 = 3. Adding those: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; +120 = 29,520; +3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw earlier. Then, each subsequent term is built by adding 1 and multiplying by 3 the previous term. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nI can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the closed-form formula works for all the layers we computed. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as we found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 times a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, we can compute a_9 directly without computing each layer. That would have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute each layer from the inside out.\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n3. After computing Layer 9, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n4. Verify each step to ensure accuracy, especially since dealing with large numbers can lead to errors.\n5. Realize that a closed-form formula exists for this type of recurrence relation, which can be used to compute the result more efficiently in the future.\n\nSo, by carefully working through each layer and verifying my calculations, I arrived at the final result. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer from the innermost to the outermost and compute each step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " That suggests that I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me try to do that. Let's start from the innermost part: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from the innermost)). So, replacing the innermost, that becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, that would be (1 + 3*13). Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, now we have 40. Let me keep track of each step so I don't get lost. So far, each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, adding 1, and then using that as the new result for the next layer out. Let me list these results step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, that seems like a lot of steps. Let me check if I'm counting correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is step 1, and moving outwards, I should have nine steps, right? But in my list above, I have nine results, from 4 up to 29524. Hmm, let me confirm:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 (step 1)\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13 (step 2)\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40 (step 3)\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121 (step 4)\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364 (step 5)\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093 (step 6)\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280 (step 7)\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841 (step 8)\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524 (step 9)\n\nYes, that's nine steps. So, after computing all the inner expressions, the outermost expression is 3 times the last result, which is 29524. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524: Let's break it down:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n3 * 500 = 1500\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because 3 * 29524 should be calculated as 29524 * 3. Let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom up: 88572. So, yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each time, the value grows quite significantly because it's a multiplicative process. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, which is an exponential growth. So, after nine layers, the innermost value is 4, and each time we go out a layer, we compute 1 + 3*(previous value). So, that's why the numbers get so big so quickly.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if that approach would work.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, with a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13,\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40,\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121,\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364,\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093,\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280,\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841,\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since this is a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result. So, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, each subsequent layer is the next number. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (and that's the innermost, so there's no more inside it). Then Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer1). Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Wait, but in the given expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, so Layer 1 would just be 1 + 3, which is 4. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer1). So, 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer2), which is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer3 is 40. Let me keep going. Layer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer4 is 121. Layer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer5 is 364. Layer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer6 is 1093. Layer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. So Layer7 is 3280. Layer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280, let me calculate that. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer8 is 9841. Finally, Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify one of the layers where I might have made a mistake. Let's take Layer7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. That looks right. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then 3*29524 is 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like each term is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but starting from 1. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series. Let me denote the innermost term as a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. If I have an expression like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...)), it's a form of a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4, as we saw. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we have. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a1 =4, which corresponds to n=1. Then each subsequent layer is a2, a3,... up to a9. So, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the total expression is 3*a9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I also get 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula without computing each layer. Since a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the formula, I end up with 88572. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nTo solve this, we recognize the pattern as a repeated structure where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we determine that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading to the final computation. \n\nThe final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, that layer is 40. Let me keep going. Next layer out is 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Then, the next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Next, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Now, the next layer out is 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Next layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9524 is... Wait, maybe I should compute it more carefully. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 24 * 3 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. Now, the next layer out is 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute that: 3*88573. Let's break it down: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Wait, but 88573 is 80,000 + 8,000 + 500 + 70 + 3. So, 80,000*3=240,000; 8,000*3=24,000; 500*3=1,500; 70*3=210; 3*3=9. Adding them up: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. So, 3*88,573 is 265,719. Then, adding 1 gives us 265,720. Now, moving out to the next layer: 1 + 3*265,720. Let me compute 3*265,720. Breaking it down: 200,000*3=600,000; 60,000*3=180,000; 5,000*3=15,000; 700*3=2,100; 20*3=60. So, adding them together: 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000; 780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000; 795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100; 797,100 + 60 = 797,160. Then, adding 1 gives us 797,161. Now, the final layer is 3*(that result). So, 3*797,161. Let me compute that. Breaking it down: 700,000*3=2,100,000; 90,000*3=270,000; 7,000*3=21,000; 100*3=300; 60*3=180; 1*3=3. Adding them up: 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000; 2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000; 2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300; 2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480; 2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483. So, 3*797,161 is 2,391,483. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 2,391,483. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4=13, then 1 + 3*13=40, 1 + 3*40=121, 1 + 3*121=364, 1 + 3*364=1093, 1 + 3*1093=3280, 1 + 3*3280=9841, 1 + 3*9841=29524, 1 + 3*29524=88573, 1 + 3*88573=265720, and finally 3*265720=797160? Wait, hold on, in my earlier steps, I think I might have messed up the count of layers. Wait, no, because the expression has nine layers of (1+3(...)), so when I started from the innermost, each step corresponds to moving out one layer. Let me recount how many times I computed each step. Starting from (1+3)=4: that's the innermost, layer 1. Then 1 + 3*4=13: layer 2. Then 1 + 3*13=40: layer 3. Then 1 + 3*40=121: layer 4. Then 1 + 3*121=364: layer 5. Then 1 + 3*364=1093: layer 6. Then 1 + 3*1093=3280: layer 7. Then 1 + 3*3280=9841: layer 8. Then 1 + 3*9841=29524: layer 9. Then 1 + 3*29524=88573: layer 10? Wait, but the original expression only has nine layers. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check the original expression again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: there are nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, that would mean nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so layer 2, 3, up to layer 9. Then, after computing layer 9, we have to multiply by 3. So, perhaps I went one step too far earlier. Let me try to recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nSo, after Layer 9, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9 result), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. So, the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I went one step further and got 797,160. That must have been a mistake because I miscounted the layers. So, actually, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we only need to multiply by 3 once, giving us 88,572. Let me verify that. So, each layer from 1 to 9 is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from layer 1: 4, then layer 2:13, layer3:40, layer4:121, layer5:364, layer6:1093, layer7:3280, layer8:9841, layer9:29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that should be the correct answer. Let me just confirm each step again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think my initial mistake was continuing one step too far, but upon recounting the layers, I realize that after Layer 9, we just multiply by 3 once. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I can also think about whether there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. It works! So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, we can directly compute the result without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's pretty cool! It shows how recognizing patterns and using recurrence relations can simplify complex nested expressions. However, since I initially approached it step by step, it was a bit time-consuming, but it helped me understand the structure of the problem better. I think both methods are valid, but knowing the formula can save a lot of time, especially if the number of layers were much larger. In any case, whether I compute each layer manually or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can compute the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Find the closed-form formula**: The recurrence relation can be solved to find \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Compute the innermost layer**: For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer**:  \nThe result of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " That means I have to compute the innermost one first, then work my way outwards. Let me start by numbering the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost. Let's say the innermost is the 9th one: 9th: 1 + 3 8th: 1 + 3(9th) 7th: 1 + 3(8th) ... and so on until the 1st, which is the outermost. Wait, actually, the innermost is the last one: 1 + 3, right? Let me check: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step. Let me define each layer as follows: Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost. Wait, but actually, since the outermost is the first one, maybe it's better to number them from the innermost as L1 to L9, with L9 being the outermost. Hmm, maybe I should just compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. So, let's define:\n\nStart with the innermost expression:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, the outermost layer is 3*(...), so perhaps Layer 1 is the innermost 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer above that is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, until the outermost layer, which is 1 + 3*(previous layer). But wait, the entire expression is 3*(...), so after computing up to Layer 9, which would be the outermost 1 + 3*(Layer 8), then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I computed Layer 9 as 29524, but that was after 9 layers. Let me confirm how many layers there are.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each time we go out one layer, we have another 1 + 3*(inner expression). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that's 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer up to the 9th, which is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, but that was the value of the outermost 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, then the entire expression would be 3*(Layer 9). So, in my earlier steps, I computed Layer 9 as 29524, which is the value of the expression inside the outermost parentheses, so then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's do that multiplication.\n\nFirst, 3*29524: 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nSo, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps again because I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this another way to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive relation, and such a recurrence can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this method confirms the result. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nI think I've done this correctly. I started by computing each layer step by step, then verified using a recurrence relation approach, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward and then multiplying the outermost result by 3, we find the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times the next nested expression.\n\n2. **Compute from the innermost layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part. Let me try that. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, (1 + 3) is 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let's keep going. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, that's a jump. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Wow, this is growing exponentially. Let me write this down step by step to keep track:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1, up to layer 9. So, each step I did above is one layer. So, after layer 1: 4, layer 2:13, layer3:40, layer4:121, layer5:364, layer6:1093, layer7:3280, layer8:9841, layer9:29524. So, the innermost is layer1:4, then layer2:13, and so on, until layer9:29524. Now, after computing the innermost parentheses, each layer's result is used in the next outer layer. So, once I get to layer9:29524, that's the result of the entire inner expression, right? Wait, no. Let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 =13, then 1 + 3*13=40, and so on, until the outermost layer is 3*(...). Wait, so the very outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, actually, after computing all the layers, the final result would be 3 times the result of layer9. Wait, let me make sure. Let me parse the expression again. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the innermost is layer1: (1 + 3)=4. Then layer2:1 +3*4=13, layer3:1 +3*13=40, layer4:1 +3*40=121, layer5:1 +3*121=364, layer6:1 +3*364=1093, layer7:1 +3*1093=3280, layer8:1 +3*3280=9841, layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's see, 29524*3. Let me compute 29524*3: 29524*3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: (1 +3)=4. Then, 1 +3*4=13. Then, 1 +3*13=40. Then, 1 +3*40=121. Then, 1 +3*121=364. Then, 1 +3*364=1093. Then, 1 +3*1093=3280. Then, 1 +3*3280=9841. Then, 1 +3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But let me verify one of the intermediate steps to be sure. Let's take layer5: 1 +3*121=1 +363=364. That's correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(...)). So, after computing all the inner layers, we have 29524, and then we multiply by 3. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see. Each layer is 1 +3*previous layer. So, starting from layer1: a1=4, a2=1 +3*a1=1 +12=13, a3=1 +3*a2=1 +39=40, and so on. So, each term is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Assume a_n = D, then D=1 +3*D => D=1 +3D => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a1=4. So, when n=1, a1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's 3*(a9), where a9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, and it gives the same result. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression.

    "text": " Since each subsequent expression is similar, perhaps I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part. Let me start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. So, let me compute that first. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3*(result from the innermost layer). So, substituting the innermost result, we have 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result), which is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, the next layer is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern forming here. Each time, I take the result from the inner layer, multiply it by 3, add 1, and that gives me the next layer's value. Let me try to formalize this. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost layer and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Wait, but hold on. Let me check that again because I think I might have miscounted the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's L1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count them: starting from the innermost, each time I see a \"1 + 3(\" that's a new layer. So, let's see: The innermost is (1 + 3). Then moving out, the next is (1 + 3*(...)), so that's L2. Then L3, and so on until L9. But wait, the original expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, L1 is (1 + 3) = 4. L2 is (1 + 3*L1) = 1 + 12 = 13. L3 is (1 + 3*L2) = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 is (1 + 3*L3) = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 is (1 + 3*L4) = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 is (1 + 3*L5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 is (1 + 3*L6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 is (1 + 3*L7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 is (1 + 3*L8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me do the multiplication step by step: 29,524 * 3. 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 +1 =7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again because sometimes when I do multiplication manually, I might make a mistake. Alternatively, I can break it down: 29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3 = 60,000 +27,000 +1,500 +60 +12 = 60,000 +27,000 =87,000 +1,500=88,500 +60=88,560 +12=88,572. Okay, that checks out. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me recount the layers: Starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 1 layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent (1+3 is a new layer. So, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the initial 3, the first ( is the start of L1. Then each subsequent ( is L2, L3, etc., up to L9. So, there are 9 layers. Therefore, my calculation up to L9 as 29,524 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, but let me verify this with a different approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Substituting L_n = B and L_{n-1}=B: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A =4 +0.5=4.5 => A=4.5/3=1.5=3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which also matches. For n=3: L3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, L9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. That's exactly what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29,524=88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 to make sure it's 59,049. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. Yes, that's correct.

    "text": " Therefore, I think the way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, calculating each layer step by step. Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost to keep track. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: 3(1 + 3) + 1? Wait, no. Actually, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(result of the innermost). Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result of the previous layer), and so on, until we get to the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3 at the end. Hmm, let me try to parse this correctly. Let me write each layer as a function of the next layer. Let me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's say that each time we have a term like 1 + 3*(next term). So starting from the innermost, which is just (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result).

So, 3*29524.\n\nCompute that: 3*29524. Let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because that seems a bit off.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900 + 180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9.

    "text": " Therefore, it's a recursive-looking expression where each layer depends on the previous one. To tackle this, I think I should start by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and then work my way outwards. Let's denote each layer as follows for clarity: Let\u2019s say the innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I can compute each Layer from 1 to 9, I can substitute each into the next layer until I get to Layer 9, and then multiply by 3. That seems manageable. Let me write down each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Layer 1 is 4. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to slip up with large numbers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For Layer 1: n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: n=2, L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4: (3^5 -1)/2 =243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. Layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct. Layer 6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct. Layer 7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct. Layer 8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct. Layer 9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula approach backed up the step-by-step computation, which is reassuring. So, yeah, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " That suggests that if I start solving from the innermost part, each step will involve computing the value inside the parentheses and then moving one layer out. Let me try to tackle this step by step. Let's start by identifying the innermost parentheses. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. That simplifies the innermost part. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So, let me write that down: 1 + 3*(innermost result) = 1 + 3*4. Wait, I just realized that each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step. Let me assign each layer a number for clarity. Let's say layer 1 is the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, after computing all nine layers, the outermost part is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression simplifies to 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's see. 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 0*3=0 +2=2. Wait, that might not be the right way. Let me write it down properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nNow, the next digit is 9 (since 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4). Wait, no, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when I multiply by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nTens: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nHundreds:5\u00d73=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nThousands:9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nTen thousands:2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.

So, I think I did it correctly, computing each layer from 1 to 9. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the layers.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 1 +3\u00d74=13\n\nLayer3:1+3\u00d713=40\n\nLayer4:1+3\u00d740=121\n\nLayer5:1+3\u00d7121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3\u00d7364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3\u00d71093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3\u00d73280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3\u00d79841=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again just to be sure. Maybe I should compute 29524\u00d73 step by step.\n\n29524\u00d73:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6+1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27+1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6+2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(... nine times...))). So, I think I accounted for all nine layers correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nWait, let me see: If I define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, then a_2=1 +3*a_1=1+12=13, a_3=1+3*a_2=1+39=40, and so on. So, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I double-checked each step, and the closed-form formula confirms the values I calculated manually. So, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

    "text": " That suggests that each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 3 times the next layer. Hmm, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let's try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so the next layer is 40. Let me keep going like this. Next layer out: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. So that layer is 121. Next, moving out: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, so next layer is 364. Continuing outward: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Hmm, so that's 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093 first. 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So that layer is 3280. Next, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So that's 9841. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So that's 29524. Next layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. So that's 88573. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute 3*88573. Let's break it down: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720. So, the innermost parentheses worked their way out to 265720. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times this result. So, 3*265720. Let me compute that. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding those: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, 3*265720 = 797160. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 797160. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Then 1 + 3*88573 = 265720. Then 3*265720 = 797160. Yeah, that seems correct. Each step, I computed the innermost expression first and worked my way out, making sure to multiply by 3 each time before adding 1. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step worked well. I don't think I made any arithmetic errors, but let me verify one or two steps to be sure. Let's pick the step where I had 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those gives 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. That seems right. Another check: 1 + 3*29524. 29524*3: Let's compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 72 = 88572. Then 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct. So, yeah, all steps seem accurate. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 797160.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1 to the result. By systematically computing each layer, the final result is found to be 797160.\n\n$\\boxed{797160}$"

    "text": " Since it's nested nine times, I think I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try to label each layer to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, looking back at the problem, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by a big parenthesis. So the outermost operation is 3*(...), where the ... is the entire nested expression. So maybe it's better to think of it as 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on. So, starting from the innermost Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, and 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000, and 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500+72=1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the total value is 88572. Wait, let me verify that calculation again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, putting it all together: Starting from the innermost Layer 1, each subsequent layer is computed by taking 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, multiplying by 3 gives us 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. I think that's the correct answer.

    "text": " That suggests that if I compute the innermost part first, each subsequent layer can be computed by plugging in the result from the inner one. So, maybe I can approach this by starting at the very end and working my way back. Let me try to parse this expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Let's denote each level as follows, from the innermost to the outermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3  \nLevel 2: 1 + 3(Level 1)  \nLevel 3: 1 + 3(Level 2)  \n...  \nLevel 9: 1 + 3(Level 8)  \nAnd the entire expression is 3(Level 9)  \n\nSo, if I compute each Level starting from 1 up to 9, each time plugging the result into the next level, I should be able to find the value of Level 9, and then multiply by 3 to get the final answer.

Let me think about that for a moment. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested rather than summed in a straightforward way.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each level is defined as Level n = 1 + 3*Level(n-1). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence and find a closed-form solution.\n\nLet's denote L(n) as the value of Level n. Then, the recurrence is:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL(n) = A*3^n + B  \nL(n-1) = A*3^(n-1) + B  \n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B)  \nSimplify the right side:  \n1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1  \nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\nL(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4  \nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nTherefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nL(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Level n, the value is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor Level 1:  \nL(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2:  \nL(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3:  \nL(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4:  \nL(4) = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5:  \nL(5) = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6:  \nL(6) = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7:  \nL(7) = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8:  \nL(8) = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9:  \nL(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for all the levels I computed earlier. So, using this formula, I can compute any Level n without having to go through each step manually. This is much more efficient, especially if n were larger.\n\nTherefore, the value of Level 9 is 29524, as previously calculated. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Level 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the final multiplication, let me compute 29524*3 again.\n\n29524  \n*      3  \n________  \nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1  \n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7  \n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1  \n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7  \n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2  \n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8  \nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nYep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can also think about this problem in terms of a geometric series, but since it's nested, it's a bit different. Each time, we're adding 1 and then scaling by 3. So, the structure is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then an additional 1 is added.\n\nBut since each layer is dependent on the previous one, the recurrence relation is more appropriate here. It's interesting that the closed-form solution is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, which is neat because it allows us to compute the value without iterating through each level, especially useful for larger n.\n\nSo, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and deriving a formula, I was able to compute the value efficiently. This approach is much better than manually computing each level, especially if the expression had more layers. It also reduces the chance of arithmetic errors that can occur when dealing with large numbers step by step.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked my work, both by computing each level step by step and by deriving a general formula to verify the result. I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each level follows the form \\( L(n) = 1 + 3 \\times L(n-1) \\), leading to the closed-form solution \\( L(n) = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this for the ninth level and multiplying by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each level is defined as \\( L(n) = 1 + 3 \\times L(n-1) \\) with \\( L(1) = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Derive the closed-form formula**: Using the recurrence relation, the general solution is \\( L(n) = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Compute Level 9**:  \n   \\( L(9) = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**:  \n   \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer**:  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Since each layer is similar, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that approach. Let's label each layer from the innermost as Layer 1 up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost expression. Wait, but in the given expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on. Hmm, maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way out. Let me try that. Starting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. So Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 = 13. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093 first. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series, perhaps? Let me try to model this. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right-hand side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524, as I found earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, since Layer9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*Layer9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the closed-form formula. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times another term.

    "text": " So, if I start from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), and work my way out, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that.

So, after computing Layer 1 as 29524, the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3. Let's compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572. So the total value is 88572.\n\nWait a second, that seems correct, but let me just verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}.\n\nWait, no, actually, since we're moving outward, each layer depends on the next one. So, if we number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nBut in our case, the entire expression is 3*a_9, because the outermost layer is 3*(...), where ... is a_9.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_1, where a_1 = 1 + 3*a_2, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_3, and so on until a_9 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, actually, the layers are defined as a_1 = 1 + 3*a_2, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_3, ..., a_9 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, to compute a_1, we need a_2, which requires a_3, and so on until a_9, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, starting from a_9 = 4, then a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_1 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let's see. If we have a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, with a_9 = 4, then perhaps we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nBut with only nine layers, it's probably easier to compute each step as I did above.\n\nAlternatively, noticing that each layer is similar to a geometric series.\n\nWait, let's think about it. Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}\n\nSo, if we unroll the recurrence, starting from a_9:\n\na_9 = 4\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of terms is small (only 9), computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nIf we denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nWait, hold on, earlier I had a_6 as 121, but now I'm getting a_6 as 1 + 3*364 = 1093? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, I think I messed up the numbering.\n\nWait, actually, in my earlier breakdown, I had:\n\nLayer 9: 4\n\nLayer 8: 13\n\nLayer 7: 40\n\nLayer 6: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 4: 1093\n\nLayer 3: 3280\n\nLayer 2: 9841\n\nLayer 1: 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*Layer 1 = 88572.\n\nBut when I tried to write the recurrence as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, starting from a_9, I think I might have confused the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to index the layers from the inside out, so that layer 1 is the innermost, and layer 9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, if I let layer 1 = (1 + 3) = 4\n\nlayer 2 = 1 + 3*layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nlayer3 = 1 + 3*layer2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nlayer4 = 1 + 3*layer3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nlayer5 = 1 + 3*layer4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nlayer6 = 1 + 3*layer5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nlayer7 = 1 + 3*layer6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nlayer8 = 1 + 3*layer7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nlayer9 = 1 + 3*layer8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, is there a formula for such a nested expression? Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, with a_9 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}.\n\nWe can rearrange it as a_{n+1} = (a_n - 1)/3.\n\nBut since we're starting from a_9 and moving up to a_1, perhaps it's better to write the recurrence as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}.\n\nWe can try to find a pattern or a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me try to express a_1 in terms of a_9.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_3\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_3\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_4\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*a_4) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*a_4\n\nContinuing this pattern, we can see that each a_n adds a term of 3^{n-1} and multiplies the next a term by 3^{n}.\n\nSo, in general, a_1 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*a_9\n\nSince a_9 = 4, this becomes:\n\na_1 = (3^9 - 1)/ (3 - 1) + 3^9*4\n\nWait, let's verify that.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nIn this case, r = 3, and n = 8, since we're summing from k=0 to k=8.\n\nSo, sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841\n\nThen, a_1 = 9841 + 3^9*a_9\n\nBut a_9 = 4, so:\n\na_1 = 9841 + 19683*4\n\nCompute 19683*4:\n\n19683 * 4:\n\n3*4=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8*4=32 +1=33, write 3, carry 3.\n\n6*4=24 +3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n9*4=36 +2=38, write 8, carry 3.\n\n1*4=4 +3=7, write 7.\n\nSo, 19683*4=78732\n\nThen, a_1 = 9841 + 78732 = 88573\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated a_1 as 29524, and then 3*a_1=88572.\n\nBut according to this formula, a_1=88573, which is different.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. There must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again.\n\nIf I unroll the recurrence:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_3\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_{10}, but wait, a_9 is the innermost, so actually, a_9 = 1 + 3*1, because the innermost is (1 + 3). Wait, no, in our problem, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, so a_9 = 4.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the formula.\n\nWait, let's see. If we have n layers, each defined as a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i+1}, with a_{n} = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*a_n = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_{n-2} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_1.\n\nSo, in general, a_1 can be expressed as a sum:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*4)...))\n\nWhich is a finite geometric series with ratio 3, starting from the innermost term.\n\nSo, the sum can be written as:\n\na_1 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9 * a_9\n\nWait, but a_9 is 4, so:\n\na_1 = (3^9 - 1)/2 + 3^9*4\n\nCompute that:\n\n(19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, 19683*4 = 78732\n\nThus, a_1 = 9841 + 78732 = 88573\n\nBut earlier, when I computed step by step, I got a_1 = 29524, and then 3*a_1 = 88572.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, if a_1 is 29524, then 3*a_1 = 88572, which matches the step-by-step computation.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_1 = 88573, which is different.\n\nSo, there must be an error in the formula approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is not correctly accounting for the number of terms.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nEach layer is a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i+1}, starting from a_9 = 4.\n\nSo, to express a_1 in terms of a_9, we have:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_3\n\n...\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_9\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_3\n\nSimilarly,\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_4\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*a_4) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*a_4\n\nContinuing this way, until:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8*a_9\n\nSo, that's a sum of 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8 plus 3^9*a_9\n\nSo, the sum is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*a_9\n\nWhich is (3^9 - 1)/2 + 3^9*a_9\n\nAs before.\n\nBut according to this, a_1 = (19683 -1)/2 + 19683*4 = 9841 + 78732 = 88573\n\nBut according to step-by-step, a_1 = 29524, and 3*a_1 = 88572.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula because the original expression is 3*a_1, not a_1.\n\nWait, in the formula, I was calculating a_1, but the total expression is 3*a_1.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIn the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_1, where a_1 is the first layer.\n\nBut in my formula, I calculated a_1 as 88573, so the total expression would be 3*88573 = 265719, which is way larger than the step-by-step result.\n\nBut that can't be, because when I computed step-by-step, I got 88572, which is 3*29524.\n\nSo, clearly, the formula approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I misnumbered the layers.\n\nWait, in the formula, I assumed that a_1 corresponds to the outermost layer, but in reality, in the problem, the outermost layer is 3*(...), which is 3*a_1, where a_1 is the first layer inside.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but I misapplied it.\n\nWait, let's try to compute a_1 using the formula:\n\na_1 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*a_9\n\nsum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841\n\n3^9*a_9 = 19683*4 = 78732\n\nSo, a_1 = 9841 + 78732 = 88573\n\nBut according to step-by-step, a_1 is 29524.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's check a small case.\n\nSuppose we have only two layers:\n\nCompute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\nWhich is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nsum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k + 3^2*a_2\n\nsum = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3^2*a_2 = 9*4 = 36\n\na_1 = 4 + 36 = 40\n\nBut the actual value is 39, so the formula gives 40, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nSo, the formula is overcounting by 1.\n\nWait, why is that?\n\nWait, in the two-layer case:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\na_2 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nThen, total expression is 3*a_1 = 39.\n\nBut according to the formula:\n\nsum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k + 3^2*a_2 = (1 + 3) + 9*4 = 4 + 36 = 40\n\nWhich is a_1 = 40, but actual a_1 is 13.\n\nSo, the formula is not applicable here.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is incorrect because the number of layers is limited, and the recurrence doesn't extend to infinity.\n\nWait, in the formula, I assumed that the series continues indefinitely, but in reality, it's finite, so the formula may not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be adjusted for the finite case.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf we have n layers, each defined as a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i+1}, with a_{n} = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*a_n = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_{n-2} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n...\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\nSo, in general, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_3\n\nContinuing this, a_1 = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*a_n\n\nIn our case, n=9, so:\n\na_1 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*a_9\n\nWhich is (3^9 -1)/2 + 3^9*4 = 9841 + 78732 = 88573\n\nBut in the two-layer case, n=2:\n\na_1 = sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k + 3^2*a_2 = (1 + 3) + 9*4 = 4 + 36 = 40\n\nBut actual a_1 = 13\n\nSo, the formula is not matching the small case.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is counting one extra layer.\n\nWait, in the two-layer case, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nSo, layers:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nTotal expression: 3*13 = 39\n\nBut according to the formula, a_1 = sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k + 3^2*a_2 = 4 + 36 = 40\n\nWhich is one more than the actual a_1=13.\n\nSo, seems like the formula is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be a_1 = sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^{k-1} + 3^n*a_n\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nIn the two-layer case:\n\na_1 = sum_{k=1}^{2} 3^{k-1} + 3^2*a_2\n\nsum = 3^0 + 3^1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3^2*a_2 = 9*4=36\n\na_1=4 +36=40, still incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is not applicable because the recurrence is finite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me consider the total expression as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)))\n\nWith nine layers of 3*(...).\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or a formula for E.\n\nAlternatively, notice that each layer adds a term that is multiplied by 3^k.\n\nWait, let me try to express E in terms of itself.\n\nWait, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)))\n\nBut that seems recursive, but with nine layers, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write E as 3*(1 + E'), where E' is a similar expression with eight layers.\n\nBut E' would then be 3*(1 + E''), and so on, until E^(9) = 3*(1 + 3)\n\nBut that might not help directly.\n\nWait, let me try.\n\nLet\u2019s define E_k as the expression with k layers.\n\nSo, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nE_3 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent with my earlier step-by-step.\n\nWait, no, in my earlier step-by-step, for two layers, I had 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39, which matches E_2=39.\n\nSimilarly, E_3 would be 3*(1 + 3*E_2) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, for three layers, I had:\n\nLayer 7: 40\n\nLayer 6: 121\n\nWait, no, perhaps I confused the layers earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nIf E_1 is one layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nE_2 is two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 39\n\nE_3 is three layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent with my earlier calculation where three layers gave 40.\n\nWait, no, in my earlier step-by-step, I had:\n\nLayer 9:4\n\nLayer8:13\n\nLayer7:40\n\nSo, with three layers, it would be:\n\nLayer7:40\n\nBut E_3 is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120, which is different from 40.\n\nSo, seems like E_k is 3*(1 + 3*E_{k-1})\n\nSo, E_1 = 12\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + 3*E_1) = 3*(1 + 36) = 3*37 = 111? Wait, no, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's define E_k as the expression with k layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n\nE_3 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n\nE_4 = 3*(1 + 3*E_3) = 3*(1 + 3*120) = 3*(1 + 360) = 3*361 = 1083\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, for four layers, I had:\n\nLayer6:121\n\nLayer5:364\n\nLayer4:1093\n\nWait, that's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the initial problem, the outermost layer is 3*(...), which is E_9, and the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nBut when I tried to compute E_k as above, E_1 corresponds to one layer inside, so perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation, as trying to find a formula is leading me astray.\n\nGiven that I've already computed each layer step-by-step and arrived at 88572, and the small cases seem to confirm that approach (e.g., two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 39, which matches 3*(1 + 3*4) = 39), I think the step-by-step approach is reliable.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That suggests that if I start from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, and work my way out, each step will involve computing the next layer. Let me try that approach. Starting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that innermost result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then that becomes the new result. So, maybe I can represent this as a recursive process where each step is defined by a function. Let me try to formalize that. Let's denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw earlier. Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Continuing this way, a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Wait, hold on, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems right. Let me check: 3*40 is indeed 120, and 120 +1 is 121. Okay, so a\u2084 is 121. Then, a\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, a\u2085 is 364. Moving on, a\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, a\u2086 is 1093. Next, a\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, a\u2087 is 3280. Continuing, a\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, a\u2088 is 9841. Finally, a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, a\u2089 is 29524. Now, remember that each a\u2099 corresponds to one layer out, starting from the innermost. Since the original expression has nine layers, the outermost expression is 3*a\u2089. So, the entire original expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13, 1 + 3*13 = 40, 1 + 3*40 = 121, 1 + 3*121 = 364, 1 + 3*364 = 1093, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the multiplication or addition steps.

    "text": " This seems like a recursive structure, where each layer depends on the previous one. Maybe I can compute the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is 1 + 3. So, that's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one step out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So, let's compute that. Let me write this down step by step. Let me define each layer as Layer 1 to Layer 9, starting from the innermost. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, after computing Layer 9, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. So, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). That is, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break this down. 29524 * 3. I can compute this step by step: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct.

    "text": " That suggests that if I start evaluating from the innermost part, each step will involve multiplying by 3 and then adding 1, but in reverse. Wait, actually, no. Let me think. If I have something like 3(a), where a is 1 + 3(b), then to compute a, I need to know b first. So, it's a recursive-like structure where each layer depends on the next. So, perhaps I can compute this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me try that. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define each layer starting from the innermost. Let\u2019s say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 (but wait, the innermost is just 1 + 3, but in the given expression, it's 1 + 3(...). Wait, let me check the expression again. The innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Because the innermost expression is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(that), and so on. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try to compute each layer one by one.\n\nSo, let's define:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's see, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check the calculations again because sometimes I might make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, and going up to Layer 9. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each one.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*L_9.\n\nLet me compute each L_n step by step:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check the multiplication again to be sure.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n---------\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThus, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that confirms the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by using a recurrence relation formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Let me try to write this out. Let's start with the innermost part: L1 = 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, L2 = 1 + 3*(L1). Since L1 is 4, that would be L2 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, L2 = 13. Next, L3 = 1 + 3*(L2). L2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, L3 = 40. Hmm, okay, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me continue this way to see if I can spot a pattern or perhaps find a formula for it. L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. L4 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. L5 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. L6 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. L7 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. L8 = 9841. Finally, L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. L9 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(L9). So, we need to compute 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting from the innermost layer: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +72 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence relation. Let me think about whether I can model this as a geometric series or something similar. Let's define each layer L_n where n is the layer number, starting from L1 as the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula for L_n is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for each layer, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so L9 is the outermost layer. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each step, and also derived a formula which confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " That suggests that if I solve the innermost one first, each subsequent layer can be built upon that. Let me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's define each nested expression as follows: Let\u2019s say E1 is the innermost expression: E1 = 1 + 3 Then, E2 would be the next one out: E2 = 1 + 3*E1 Then E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, until E9, which is the entire expression. Wait, but the problem is 3*(E9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, maybe I should adjust my definitions. Let me try that again. Let me define each nested part as follows: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's E1. Then, moving outward, each expression is 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, E2 = 1 + 3*E1, E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9. Then, the entire expression would be 3*E9. So, if I compute E1 through E9 step by step, I can find the value of E9, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. That seems manageable. Let me start computing each E from E1 to E9. \n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so E2 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13, which is 39. Then, E3 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nMoving on to E4: E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so E4 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, E5 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12, so adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Therefore, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E9, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. I can break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nStarting from E1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Let me verify 29524*3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 29524*3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check E9 again. E9 is 1 + 3*E8, where E8 is 9841. So, 3*9841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nI think my calculations are right. Each step builds upon the previous one, and I don't see any errors in the multiplication or addition. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer.

    "text": " It looks like a recursive structure, but maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me start by evaluating the innermost part first. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that part, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)))))))) Now, let me compute the next layer out. The next innermost part is 1 + 3*4. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Actually, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next inner expression. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). So, 1 + 12, which is 13. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. So, each time, I take the innermost expression, compute it, and then move outward, replacing each part as I go. So, let me try to structure this. Let me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times this Layer 9 expression, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (20 * 3) + (4 * 3)\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to compute this without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step is manageable.\n\nWait, another thought: each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it that way to confirm my result.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding it, the innermost is 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27, and so on. Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me check.\n\nWait, if I expand the expression, each layer adds a term that's 3^n. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nWait, that seems to be a pattern. So, each layer n adds 3^{n} as an additional term. So, layer 9 would be the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, right? Because each layer adds another power of 3.\n\nWait, but the first layer is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nSimilarly, layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, in general, layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k.\n\nBut wait, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 3^0 + 3^1. So, layer 9 would be the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Which matches the formula I derived earlier.\n\nSo, layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 times this, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think this confirms the answer. Let me just check once more to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, (59049 - 1)/2 is indeed 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute it step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n30000 * 3 = 90000\n\n476 * 3 = 1428\n\nSo, 29524 = 30000 - 476\n\nThus, 29524 * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after verifying all the steps and using different methods to compute, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085. Wait, but in the original problem, after the innermost (1+3), there are eight more layers. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: (1+3), then moving out, each time adding another layer. So, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3)=4. Then layer 2: 3*(1 + layer1)=3*(5)=15. Layer3:3*(1+15)=3*16=48. Layer4:3*(1+48)=3*49=147. Layer5:3*(1+147)=3*148=444. Layer6:3*(1+444)=3*445=1335. Layer7:3*(1+1335)=3*1336=4008. Layer8:3*(1+4008)=3*4009=12027. Layer9:3*(1+12027)=3*12028=36084. Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084)=3*36085=108255. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, let's see:\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each nested expression as E_n, where n is the number of layers. So, E_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to E_9.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(E_9), right? Because the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, let me check the structure again.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is E_1 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}.\n\nSo, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 12 = 13? Wait, no, wait: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought E_2 was 15. That suggests I made a mistake in my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nIf E_1 is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, E_2 is 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier result. So, where did I go wrong before?\n\nIn my initial approach, I thought that each layer was 3*(1 + previous layer), but I think I miscounted the layers or misapplied the operations.\n\nLet me clarify: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nWait, but according to the E_n approach, E_2 should be 1 + 3*E_1 = 13, but that's not matching with the initial approach.\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether each layer is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, or whether each layer is 3*(1 + E_{n-1}).\n\nWait, let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nSo, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is the next layer.\n\nSo, if I denote each layer as F_n, starting from the innermost, then:\n\nF_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nF_2 = 3*(1 + F_1).\n\nF_3 = 3*(1 + F_2).\n\nAnd so on, up to F_9.\n\nWait, but that might not be the right way. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression can be represented as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define each nested expression as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say that starting from the innermost, each term is of the form 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nTerm1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nTerm2 = 1 + 3*Term1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nTerm3 = 1 + 3*Term2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nTerm4 = 1 + 3*Term3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nTerm5 = 1 + 3*Term4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nTerm6 = 1 + 3*Term5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nTerm7 = 1 + 3*Term6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nTerm8 = 1 + 3*Term7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nTerm9 = 1 + 3*Term8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Term9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that would be the result.\n\nBut wait, in my initial approach, I thought each layer was 3*(1 + previous layer), which gave me a different result. So, perhaps I need to clarify whether each layer is 3*(1 + previous) or 1 + 3*previous.\n\nWait, in the expression, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + ...). So, each layer is 3 times (1 plus the next layer).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 3*(1 + (1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nWait, but that would be the second layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, the third layer would be 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nFourth layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nFifth layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nSixth layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nSeventh layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nEighth layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nNinth layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because I'm getting two different results depending on how I approach it.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether each layer is 3*(1 + previous) or 1 + 3*previous.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nBut earlier, when I defined E_n as 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, I got a different result. So, which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is whether the layers are 3*(1 + previous) or 1 + 3*previous.\n\nIn the expression, each layer after the innermost is 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is the next layer.\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, the next is 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nAnd so on, up to the ninth layer, which would be 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + ninth layer).\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), where ... is the entire nested expression.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nSo, each layer is 3*(1 + ...).\n\nTherefore, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nSo, that would be the result.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought of E_n as 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, I got a different result, but I think that approach was incorrect because each layer is actually 3*(1 + E_{n-1}).\n\nWait, no, if I define E_n as the value of the nth layer, then E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}).\n\nWait, but starting from E_1 = 4.\n\nThen, E_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nE_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nE_4 = 3*(1 + E_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nE_5 = 3*(1 + E_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nE_6 = 3*(1 + E_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nE_7 = 3*(1 + E_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nE_8 = 3*(1 + E_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nE_9 = 3*(1 + E_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + E_9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried defining E_n as 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, I got a different result, which was incorrect because I misapplied the recurrence.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to recognize that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous), up to nine layers, and then the entire expression is 3*(1 + ninth layer).\n\nTherefore, the final result is 108,255.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085.\n\nNow, computing 3*36085:\n\n36085 * 3:\n\n36085 * 3:\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n\n0*3=0 +2=2.\n\n6*3=18, write down 8, carryover 1.\n\n3*3=9 +1=10, write down 0, carryover 1.\n\nFinally, carryover 1.\n\nSo, 36085 * 3 = 108,255.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 108,255.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. I had a moment of confusion earlier when I misapplied the recurrence, but by carefully stepping through each layer and ensuring that each step is 3*(1 + previous layer), I arrived at the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 3 times (1 plus the next layer). Starting from the innermost parentheses, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 15\\).\n3. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 48\\).\n4. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 147\\).\n5. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 444\\).\n6. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 1335\\).\n7. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 4008\\).\n8. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 12027\\).\n9. Next: \\(3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 36084\\).\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times (1 + 36084) = 3 \\times 36085 = 108255\\).\n\n\\boxed{108255}"

Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12. Then, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute 3*13 first. 3*13 is 39. Then, add 1: 1 + 39 = 40. Alright, so that layer is 40. Next layer out is 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute 3*40, which is 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, this layer is 121. Moving outward again, the next expression is 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute 3*121. Hmm, 121*3. Let me do that step by step: 100*3 = 300, 20*3 = 60, 1*3 = 3. So, 300 + 60 = 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364. So, this layer is 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 = 900, 60*3 = 180, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, that layer is 1093. Moving outward again, the next expression is 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3*1093. Let's break it down: 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, this layer is 3280. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 = 9000, 200*3 = 600, 80*3 = 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, this layer is 9841. Moving outward again, the next expression is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, that's a bit bigger. Let me break it down: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, this layer is 29524. Now, moving outward one more layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. Let me break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. So, this layer is 88573. Now, finally, the outermost layer is 3 times this result. So, we have 3*(88573). Let me compute that. 80000*3 = 240000, 8000*3 = 24000, 500*3 = 1500, 70*3 = 210, 3*3 = 9. Adding those up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 equals 265,719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265,719. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4, then each subsequent layer: 1+3*previous result. So, 1 + 3*4=13, 1 + 3*13=40, 1 + 3*40=121, 1 + 3*121=364, 1 + 3*364=1093, 1 + 3*1093=3280, 1 + 3*3280=9841, 1 + 3*9841=29524, 1 + 3*29524=88573. Then, 3*88573=265719. Yeah, that seems consistent. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.

Now, moving out another level, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so that's 40. Continuing this way, the next level would be 1 + 3*40. Let me compute 3*40 first: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, that's 121. Next level: 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, then 1 + 363 = 364.

Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 0*3=0, write down 0. 0*3=0, write down 0. Wait, but 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so actually, let me do it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carry 0.\nThen, since there are no more digits, we're done.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify: 29524*3. Let me compute 30000*3=90000. Then subtract (30000 - 29524)=476*3=1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute 3*88573. Hmm, let's break it down:\n\n80000*3=240000\n8000*3=24000\n500*3=1500\n70*3=210\n3*3=9\n\nSo, adding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000. 264000 + 1500 = 265500. 265500 + 210 = 265710. 265710 + 9 = 265719. So, 3*88573=265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*265720. Let me compute 3*265720. Well, 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding these up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000. 780000 + 15000 = 795000. 795000 + 2100 = 797100. 797100 + 60 = 797160. So, 3*265720=797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check my calculations because this seems like a very large number, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me verify 3*265720. Let me compute 265720 * 3. \n\n200000*3=600000\n60000*3=180000\n5000*3=15000\n700*3=2100\n20*3=60\n\nAdding them up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000. 780000 + 15000 = 795000. 795000 + 2100 = 797100. 797100 + 60 = 797160. So, yes, that's correct. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost, we have 3*(result). So, in the very first step, we computed the innermost as 1 + 3 = 4, then multiplied by 3: 3*4 = 12, then added 1: 1 + 12 = 13. Wait, no, actually, looking back, I think I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, when I computed the innermost, I should have computed 1 + 3*(innermost), then multiplied by 3, but actually, in the expression, each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, perhaps I should be multiplying by 3 after adding 1 each time.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this more carefully. Let me number the parentheses for clarity.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1, then E2, E3, up to E9, where E9 is the outermost expression.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(E9). So, the total expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, E1 is 1 + 3, then E2 is 1 + 3*E1, and so on, up to E9, which is the innermost. Then, the outermost expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I started with E1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., and then the final result was 797161, but that would be E9. But the problem is 3*E9, so I think I missed that last multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, let me check the structure again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went up to E9 = 29524, but then I continued further, which was incorrect because the outermost expression is 3*E9. So, after computing E9 = 29524, the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, let's correct that. So, E1 = 4, E2 = 13, E3 = 40, E4 = 121, E5 = 364, E6 = 1093, E7 = 3280, E8 = 9841, E9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524.\n\nSo, let's compute 3*29524. Let me do that step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went beyond E9, which was incorrect. So, the correct total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the number of E's.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new E. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen each layer adds another E:\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*E9.\n\nSo, E9 is the innermost expression, and the outermost is 3*E9. Therefore, the total number of layers is 9, with E1 being the innermost and E9 being the one before the outermost 3*(E9).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(E9), where E9 is 1 + 3*(E8). So, E9 is the innermost, and the outermost is 3*E9.\n\nSo, in my earlier calculation, I computed up to E9 = 29524, and then the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went beyond that, which was a mistake. So, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me write down each E step by step.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first is 3(1+3(...)), then inside that, another 1+3(...), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" introduces a new layer. Let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3(1+3, there are 8 more \"1+3(\" inside. Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", then each subsequent \"(\" adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then another \"(\", so total 2\n3. Then another \"(\", total 3\n4. Another \"(\", total 4\n5. Another \"(\", total 5\n6. Another \"(\", total 6\n7. Another \"(\", total 7\n8. Another \"(\", total 8\n9. Another \"(\", total 9\n\nWait, but the innermost is 1+3, so after that, there are 8 more \"(\", making a total of 9 layers inside. Therefore, E1 to E9, and the outermost is 3*E9.\n\nTherefore, my calculation up to E9 = 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572 is correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went beyond E9, which was a mistake. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct. Let's say I have 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1+3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nSo, the result is 120.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute it directly:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(40) = 120. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, if I have 3(1+3(1+3)), it's 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(13) = 39.\n\nWait, so in the original problem, with 9 layers, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nEach layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find E_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find B by setting E_n = E_{n-1} = B.\n\nSo, B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition E_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, E_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, E_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if this formula holds for smaller n.\n\nFor n=1, E_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, E_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3, E_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*E_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After evaluating all layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. The entire expression is then 3 times this value, resulting in 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That seems like a recursive structure, but maybe I can compute each layer step by step without getting into recursion. Let me try that. I'll start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the second innermost parentheses simplifies to 13. Next layer out, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that becomes 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, that's 364. Next, 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that layer is 1093. Next, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that layer is 9841. Next, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that layer simplifies to 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524 first. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, no, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 29524 is actually 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524. So, 3*29524: let me compute it step by step. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Then, adding 1: 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses simplifies to 88573. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times that result. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Now, adding all those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265719. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4, then 1+3*4=13, 1+3*13=40, 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524, 1+3*29524=88573. Then, 3*88573=265719. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each time, the expression is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 4, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if that's the case. So, 4, then 1 + 3*4=13, then 1 + 3*13=40, then 1 + 3*40=121, and so on. So, it's like each term is (previous term)*3 + 1. That looks like a geometric series or something similar. Wait, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9, since there are nine layers. So, the innermost is a_1 = 4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, and then the entire original expression is 3*(1 + 3*a_9) = 3*(1 + 88572) = 3*88573=265719. So, that matches my previous calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's see, since each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the initial terms. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's correct. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*a_9) = 3*(1 + 3*29524) = 3*(1 + 88572) = 3*88573. Now, let's compute 3*88573. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 88573 * 3: 3*3=9, 3*7=21, 3*5=15, 3*8=24, 3*8=24. Wait, actually, let me write it down:\n\n      88573\n    x      3\n    --------\n      265719\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 (carry) = 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 (carry) = 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n\n3*8 = 24 + 2 (carry) = 26, write down 6, carry over 2, but since there are no more digits, write down 2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 88573*3 is 265719, as I calculated before. Let me check:\n\n88573 * 3:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write 1, carry 2\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2\n\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carry 2\n\nSince there are no more digits, write the carry 2 before the others, making it 265719. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 265719. So, after breaking it down step by step, computing each layer from the inside out, and verifying with a general formula for the sequence, I'm confident that the answer is 265719.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost to keep track. Let's say the innermost one is layer 1, then the next one is layer 2, all the way up to layer 9, which is the outermost. So, layer 1: 1 + 3 (but wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So actually, layer 1 is just 1 + 3, right? Wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, actually, the innermost layer would be 1 + 3*(something). But if I go all the way to the innermost, it's 1 + 3, because there's nothing inside. Wait, let me check. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? Because the innermost parentheses would be 1 + 3, then the next layer would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. Let me confirm that. Let's look at the original expression: the innermost part is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, but that seems a bit too big. Let me check again. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. So, starting with the innermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3. That's 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, that's 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but that can't be right because when I multiply by 3 at the end, it would be 3*29524, which is 88572. But that seems too large. Let me check my steps again because I think I might have miscounted the layers. Wait, the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, I have 1+3, which is 4. Then, each layer adds another 1+3*(previous result). So, let's list each layer properly. Let me define each layer as L1 to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9), so 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. Let me recheck each step. L1: 1+3=4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 *3. Let's break it down: 20,000 *3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72.

    "text": " So, maybe if I start solving from the innermost part, each step will involve computing a part of the expression and then substituting it back into the outer layers. Let's try that approach. Let me label each layer from the inside out for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, with the outermost being Layer 9. Wait, but actually, looking at the expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times something). So, perhaps it's better to think of each layer as a function of the previous one. Let me define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s denote Layer 1 as: L1 = 1 + 3 Then, Layer 2 would be: L2 = 1 + 3*L1 Layer 3: L3 = 1 + 3*L2 And so on, up to Layer 9: L9 = 1 + 3*L8 Then, the entire expression would be 3*L9. Hmm, that seems manageable. So, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from L1 and moving up to L9, I can substitute each result into the next layer. Let me start calculating each layer one by one. Let's begin with Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that was simple enough. Now, Layer 2: L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Alright, L2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Got it, L3 is 40. Layer 4: L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 So, L4 is 121. Layer 5: L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Hmm, 364. Layer 6: L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Okay, that's a big jump. Let me double-check that calculation. 3 times 364 is indeed 1092, and adding 1 gives 1093. So, L6 is 1093. Layer 7: L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Wow, that's a huge number. Let me verify: 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Okay, so L8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, L9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times L9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3 times 29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, I can do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 0*3=0, write down 0. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check using a calculator method: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. Then, 3*L9=88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify each layer again quickly to catch any possible errors. L1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f L2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f L3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f L4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f L5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f L6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f L7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f L8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f L9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, each step checks out.

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3), right? Because each time, the innermost expression is just 1 plus 3. So, let me compute that first. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer becomes 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, I take the previous result, multiply by 3, add 1, and that gives the next layer's value. Let me check if this pattern holds. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Then, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute that: 3*364. Hmm, 364 times 3. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so adding those up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Next layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute 3*88573. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding those up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720. Now, after computing all the inner layers, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses simplifies to 265720. So, the original problem is 3 multiplied by this result. Therefore, I need to compute 3 * 265720. Let me do that: 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Wait a second, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculation again because 3 * 265720 should be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I should just multiply 265720 by 3 directly. Let me compute 265720 * 3. 200000 * 3 = 600000, 60000 * 3 = 180000, 5000 * 3 = 15000, 700 * 3 = 2100, 20 * 3 = 60. Adding them up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Hmm, same result. But wait, 265720 * 3 is 797160. But let me verify this multiplication step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake. 265,720 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit. Starting from the right: 0 * 3 = 0, 2 * 3 = 6, 7 * 3 = 21 (write down 1, carry over 2), 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 (carried over) = 17 (write down 7, carry over 1), 6 * 3 = 18 + 1 (carried over) = 19 (write down 9, carry over 1), 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carried over) = 7. So, writing it all together, it's 797,160. Okay, that seems correct. So, the final result is 797,160. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the inner layers because that could throw off the entire result. Let me go back through each layer step by step to check for errors. Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 again. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those: 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*29524. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. 60000+27000=87000+1500=88500+60=88560+12=88572. So, 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*88573. 88573*3: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. 240000+24000=264000+1500=265500+210=265710+9=265719. So, 1 + 265719 = 265720. Correct. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*265720 = 797,160. So, after double-checking each step, I didn't find any errors. Therefore, the final answer is 797,160. I think that's correct. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but by breaking it down step by step and verifying each calculation, I can be confident in the result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer's value is computed and used in the next. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n12. Finally: 3 * 265720 = 797160\n\n$\\boxed{797160}$"

    "text": " Since each layer is similar, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each step individually. But perhaps it's easier to just compute each layer step by step. Let me try that. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that 4. So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3 times 13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. Hmm, okay, so far, each time we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me see if I can generalize this. Each layer seems to be of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous value). Let me note down each step systematically. Let me define each layer as a term. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\nWait, hold on, I think I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we have 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I think I might have miscalculated the carry-over.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12, so 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, so 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, so 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Maybe I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3 as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the layers, let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is correct, and then multiplying the final layer by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series inside out.\n\nIn general, for such nested expressions, if we have something like a + b(a + b(a + ... )), it can be represented as a continued multiplication. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nLet me consider the innermost term as the base case, and each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. So, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one.\n\nLet me denote the nth term as a_n. Then, the recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nwith a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is the particular solution.\n\nTo find C, we can solve the equation C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nWait, that would be if the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because our terms are all positive. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a particular solution is a constant K. Then,\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSubtract 3K from both sides:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 is (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divide by 2: 177144/2 = 88572. Exactly the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute a couple more layers using the formula to see if they match.\n\nFor example, n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Which is correct, as I had before.\n\nSimilarly, n=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula is solid. Therefore, using it for n=9 is valid.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer adds a multiplication by 3 and an addition of 1. So, it's a geometric progression with a ratio of 3, but each term is also being scaled by 3 and shifted by 1.\n\nBut regardless, using the formula I derived, it's much quicker and less error-prone than computing each layer manually, especially if there are many layers.\n\nIn summary, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result.\n\n3. Notice a pattern that could be represented by a recurrence relation.\n\n4. Solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula.\n\n5. Use the formula to compute the 9th layer directly.\n\n6. Multiply the final result by 3 as per the original expression.\n\n7. Verify the result using alternative methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis systematic approach helped me manage the complexity of the problem and arrive at the correct solution without getting lost in the layers of parentheses.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the formula**: Recognize the pattern as a geometric series and use the formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\) for the nth layer. For Layer 9:\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " That suggests that I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one, and then work my way outwards. So, let's start from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's simple enough. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that innermost result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. Continuing this process, the next expression is 1 + 3 times 40. That would be 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, now we have 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate that: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, the next result is 364. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that: 3*364 is... Hmm, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that layer gives us 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093 first. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that layer is 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that layer gives us 29524. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that layer is 88573. Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute 3*88573. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. So, the outermost expression evaluates to 265720. Now, remembering the entire original expression was 3 multiplied by this outermost result. So, the entire expression is 3*(265720). Let me compute that. 3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*700 is 2100, 3*20 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right because 3*265720 should be 797160? Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in breaking it down. Alternatively, I can compute 265720*3 directly. Let me do that: 265720 * 3. Let's compute 200000*3 = 600000. 60000*3 = 180000, so 600000 + 180000 = 780000. 5000*3 = 15000, so 780000 + 15000 = 795000. 700*3 = 2100, so 795000 + 2100 = 797100. 20*3 = 60, so 797100 + 60 = 797160. Hmm, that seems correct. So, 3*265720 is indeed 797160. Wait, but when I computed the outermost expression, I thought it was 265720, but when I multiplied by 3, I got 797160. But wait, let me double-check the steps because I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720. Correct.\n\nSo, all the layers seem correct. Then, multiplying 265720 by 3 gives 797160. Hmm, but I have a feeling that the answer might be different because sometimes with these nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...). Starting from the innermost, each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), that's 1 layer.\n\nThen, each time we go out, it's another layer. So, let me list them:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. (1 + 3*29524) = 88573\n11. (1 + 3*88573) = 265720\n\nWait, so actually, there are 11 layers here because starting from the innermost, each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the outermost layer is the 11th one, which is 265720. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, which is 3*265720 = 797160. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I miscounted because sometimes when you have multiple parentheses, it's easy to get confused. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can represent this as a recursive formula. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, if I compute f(1) through f(11), I should get the same results as before. Let's see:\n\nf(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nf(10) = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nf(11) = 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, f(11) is 265720, and then the entire expression is 3*f(11) = 3*265720 = 797160. So, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's see if there's a pattern or a formula for f(n). The recursive formula is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it explicitly. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a particular solution. Let's find C. If we assume f(n) = C is a constant solution, then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but our f(n) are all integers. Maybe this approach isn't the best here. Alternatively, perhaps we can express f(n) in terms of a geometric series. Let's expand the recursion:\n\nf(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1)\n\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*f(n-2))\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*f(n-2)\n\nContinuing this way, until we get to f(1):\n\nf(n) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n} * f(0)\n\nWait, but f(1) = 4, which is 1 + 3 = 4. So, f(1) = 1 + 3*f(0). If f(1) = 4, then 4 = 1 + 3*f(0) => f(0) = (4 - 1)/3 = 1. So, f(0) = 1. Therefore, the general formula would be:\n\nf(n) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} + 3^{n+1}*f(0)\n\nBut f(0) = 1, so:\n\nf(n) = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k + 3^{n+1}\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. Let's write out f(n):\n\nf(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1)\n\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*f(n-2))\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*f(n-2)\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*f(n-3))\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*f(n-3)\n\nContinuing this, we get:\n\nf(n) = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k + 3^{n+1}*f(0)\n\nSince f(0) = 1, as we found earlier, this becomes:\n\nf(n) = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k + 3^{n+1}\n\nThe sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/ (3 - 1) ) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\nf(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 + 3^{n+1} = (3^{n+1} - 1 + 2*3^{n+1}) / 2 = (3*3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nsum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nThen, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 + 3^{n+1} = (3^{n+1} - 1 + 2*3^{n+1}) / 2 = (3^{n+1} + 2*3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, f(n) = (3^{n+2} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nf(1) = (3^{1+2} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. But wait, earlier we had f(1) = 4. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so my formula must be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me try again. The recursion is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nLet me compute f(n) using the formula f(n) = A*3^n + B.\n\nAssume f(n) = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recursion:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4.\n\nf(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the explicit formula is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's the same formula I had before. But when n=1, f(1) should be 4, but according to this formula, f(1) = (3^{1+1} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, f(2) = (3^{2+1} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nf(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula is correct: f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=11, f(11) = (3^{12} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^12:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 =9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\n3^12=531441\n\nSo, f(11) = (531441 -1)/2 = 531440/2 =265720. That's correct, which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*f(11) =3*265720=797160.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the original expression has 11 layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until we have 11 layers. So, yes, n=11.\n\nThus, f(11)=265720, and the entire expression is 3*265720=797160.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 797160.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me compute 3^12 again:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\n3^12=531441\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, f(11)= (531441 -1)/2=531440/2=265720.\n\nThen, 3*265720=797160.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 797160.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n2. Substitute back into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 88573\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 88573 = 265720\n   \\]\n4. Finally, multiply the outermost result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 265720 = 797160\n   \\]\n\nThus, the computed value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{797160}\\)."
