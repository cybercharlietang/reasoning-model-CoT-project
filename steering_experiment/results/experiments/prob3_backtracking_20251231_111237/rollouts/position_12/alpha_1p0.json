    "text": " Let me try to tackle this step by step. Maybe I can compute the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let's label each part to keep track. Let me denote each innermost expression as follows: Let's start from the innermost one: Let\u2019s define E1 = 1 + 3 Then, moving one layer out, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 Then, E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9, which would be the outermost expression. Wait, but the original expression is 3*(E9). So, if I can compute E1 through E9, then multiply E9 by 3, I should get the answer. Let me try that approach. So, let's compute each E step by step.\n\nFirst, E1 = 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, E1 = 4.\n\nNext, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, that's 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, E2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, E3 = 40.\n\nNow, E4 = 1 + 3*E3. E3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So, E4 = 121.\n\nNext, E5 = 1 + 3*E4. E4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, E5 = 364.\n\nMoving to E6 = 1 + 3*E5. E5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, E6 = 1093.\n\nNow, E7 = 1 + 3*E6. E6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, E7 = 3280.\n\nNext, E8 = 1 + 3*E7. E7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, E8 = 9841.\n\nFinally, E9 = 1 + 3*E8. E8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, E9 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3*(E9). So, after computing E9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's see. 29524*3. Let me break it down: 29000*3 = 87000, and 524*3 = 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in computing E9. Because when I computed E9 as 1 + 3*E8, and E8 was 9841, then 3*9841 is indeed 29523, and adding 1 gives 29524. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might miscalculate somewhere.\n\nStarting with E1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check the original expression again. It's 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with nine layers. So, I think I did each step correctly, computing E1 through E9, each time plugging the previous result into the next. Then, the final result is 3*E9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and then finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4.\n\nE1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works for each step. Therefore, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the original expression is 3*E9, which is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the result.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, E9 = 29524, and 3*E9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistake in the multiplication step. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7.\n\n9 *3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n= 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, used both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). By computing each layer step by step and using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me try to compute this step by step, starting from the innermost part. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let me define each part as follows: Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 3 times that previous layer. So, perhaps I can compute each layer one by one. Let me try to write this out. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, L2 = 13. Then, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, L3 = 40. Hmm, okay, this seems manageable. Let me keep going. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, L4 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, L5 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Therefore, L6 = 1093. Hmm, getting bigger each time. Let me proceed. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, L7 = 3280. Wow, that's a big jump. Let me go on. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, L8 = 9841. Finally, L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, L9 = 29524. Now, remember that the entire expression is 3 times L9. So, the original expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let me break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's right. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step built upon the previous one, and I verified each multiplication as I went.

    "text": " Maybe if I start from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, and work my way out, I can compute each step. Let's try that. Let me label each layer from the inside out as layers 1 to 9, maybe that will help me keep track. Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can get to the final answer. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Now Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13, which is 39. Then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 364*3. Let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 3*364 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So 3*1093 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So 3*3280 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So 3*9841 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with such large numbers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Maybe I can represent this recursively. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. This recurrence relation is linear, so perhaps I can solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers to make sure it's correct. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when I computed layer by layer. So, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. However, because it's nested, it's a bit different. The formula I derived earlier seems to be the most straightforward way to compute it without manually calculating each layer. So, to recap, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Using the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n=9, we find L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work to ensure accuracy. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the result from the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By working from the innermost layer outward and using a derived formula, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) can be expressed as \\(\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me try to represent each layer as a function. Let's define a sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let's say a\u2081 = 1 + 3. Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081. Similarly, a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082, and so on, up to a\u2089. Then, the entire expression would be 3a\u2089. Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me test this idea. Starting with a\u2081: a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Continuing this way: a\u2084 = 1 + 3a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. a\u2085 = 1 + 3a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. a\u2086 = 1 + 3a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a\u2087 = 1 + 3a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a\u2088 = 1 + 3a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a\u2089 = 1 + 3a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, the innermost part, which is the ninth layer, gives us a\u2089 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this value: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Well, 3 * 29,000 is 87,000. 3 * 524 is 1,572. So, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me verify this because the numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a multiplication error. Let me recompute a\u2089 and then 3*a\u2089. Starting from a\u2081: a\u2081 = 4. a\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. Now, add them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. I can also think about this problem in terms of geometric series or recursive relations, but given that the expression is finite with a specific number of layers, computing each layer step by step seems straightforward and reliable. It's a bit tedious, but with careful computation, I can avoid mistakes. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Substitute this result into the next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost expression.\n\nAfter computing each layer, the final result is multiplied by 3. The step-by-step computation leads to the final answer:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me assign variables to each level to make it clearer.

So maybe it's better to think of each step as A_{n} = 1 + 3*A_{n-1}, starting from A\u2081 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? So let me compute that first.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. So the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost expression). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another level, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So that's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So that layer is 40. Hmm, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and so on. Let me see if I can find a pattern here or perhaps a formula to compute this without having to do each step manually, especially since there are nine layers to compute. Wait, but maybe it's manageable since nine isn't too large a number. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1. A\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. A\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. A\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. A\u2084 = 1 + 3*A\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. A\u2085 = 1 + 3*A\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. A\u2086 = 1 + 3*A\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. A\u2087 = 1 + 3*A\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. A\u2088 = 1 + 3*A\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. A\u2089 = 1 + 3*A\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so each A_n is defined as A_n = 1 + 3*A_{n-1}, starting with A\u2081 = 4. So I computed up to A\u2089, which is 29524. But in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(A\u2089). Because the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer. So the problem is asking for 3*A\u2089, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4*3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nThen 2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8 and carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 +1 = 28, write down 8, carry 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo yes, that gives 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my computations for each A_n to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting with A\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nA\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nA\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nA\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840, +0=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nA\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo A\u2089 is indeed 29524. Then 3*A\u2089 is 3*29524, which is 88572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication of 29524 by 3. Let me compute it again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 +1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 +2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series because each term is defined recursively as A_n = 1 + 3*A_{n-1}. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form is A_n = a + r*A_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence is A_n = (A_0 - a/(1 - r)) * r^n + a/(1 - r), assuming r \u2260 1.\n\nWait, but in our case, A_1 = 4, and each subsequent term is A_n = 1 + 3*A_{n-1}. So, a = 1, r = 3.\n\nSo, the general solution would be A_n = (A_1 - a/(1 - r)) * r^{n - 1} + a/(1 - r).\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is A_n^h = C*r^n.\n\nThe particular solution is a constant, say A_p, so substituting into the recurrence: A_p = 1 + 3*A_p. Solving for A_p: A_p - 3*A_p = 1 => -2*A_p = 1 => A_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is A_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition A_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, A_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for A_9, n would be 9, so A_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula for the linear recurrence, which gives the same result. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute this by starting from the innermost part and then building my way out. Let me try to label each part to keep track. Let me denote each inner expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost and E9 is the outermost. So, starting from the inside: E1 = 1 + 3 Then, E2 = 1 + 3*E1, E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9 = 1 + 3*E8, and then the entire expression is 3*E9. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(E9), where E9 is 1 + 3*E8, and E8 is 1 + 3*E7, etc., all the way down to E1. So, maybe if I compute E1 first, then E2, and so on, each time using the result from the previous step, I can build up to E9 and then multiply by 3. Let's try that approach.\n\nStarting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving out one layer, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, that becomes E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so E2 is 13. Next, E3 = 1 + 3*E2. Plugging in E2 = 13, we get E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, E3 is 40. Let's keep going.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3. E3 is 40, so E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. E4 is 121. Next, E5 = 1 + 3*E4. E4 is 121, so E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E5 is 364.\n\nMoving on to E6 = 1 + 3*E5. E5 is 364, so E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E6 is 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6.

E8 is 9841, so E9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. E9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E9, so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Let's add them up step by step: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let's take E5, for example. E5 = 1 + 3*E4. E4 was 121, so 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, E6 = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nAnd then 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each step is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, right? So, that's a recurrence relation. The general form is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}.\n\nIf I can find a closed-form formula for E_n, that might help verify my result without computing each step. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say E_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4. When n=1, E1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: E1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: E3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, using the formula E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, I can compute each E_n directly without having to compute each step. That's a much faster method and reduces the chance of error. So, E9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as I found earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(E9), where E9 is built up from the innermost term. But using the formula, it's clear that each En follows a geometric progression, which makes sense because each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nI think I've got it. The key was recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula to compute E9 directly. This way, I avoid the tedium of computing each step individually and reduce the chance of making an arithmetic mistake. It's interesting how recognizing patterns in math problems can simplify the solution process.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure of the expression.\n2. Recognize that each inner expression follows a recurrence relation.\n3. Derive a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation.\n4. Compute the required term using the formula.\n5. Multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nThis systematic approach helps in solving such problems efficiently. I should remember this method for similar nested expressions in the future. It's a good reminder of how important it is to look for patterns and apply mathematical concepts like recurrence relations and geometric series to simplify complex-looking problems.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is that each En is one more than three times the previous term, which is a classic setup for a geometric series. The closed-form solution using the formula for the nth term of a geometric progression makes sense here. It's always satisfying when different areas of math interconnect like that.\n\nIn conclusion, by breaking down the problem, recognizing the underlying mathematical structure, and applying the appropriate formulas, I was able to compute the value of the given expression accurately. It's a good exercise in problem-solving and mathematical thinking.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each term follows a specific recurrence relation. By recognizing the pattern and applying a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we can efficiently compute the value.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms: \n   \\[\n   3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n   \\]\n   Each term inside the parentheses is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next term)}\\).\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let \\(E_n\\) represent the nth term starting from the innermost parenthesis. The recurrence relation is:\n   \\[\n   E_n = 1 + 3 \\times E_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with the innermost term \\(E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Find the Closed-Form Formula:**\n   The recurrence relation \\(E_n = 3E_{n-1} + 1\\) is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. Solving it yields:\n   \\[\n   E_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute \\(E_9\\):**\n   Since there are nine layers, compute \\(E_9\\):\n   \\[\n   E_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Final Expression:**\n   Multiply \\(E_9\\) by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times E_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to parse it from the inside out. Let me start by assigning each innermost expression a variable to make it easier. Let's denote the innermost part as A. So, starting from the very inside: A = 1 + 3 Then, moving one layer out, we have B = 1 + 3A Then, next layer: C = 1 + 3B, and so on, until we reach the outermost layer. Since there are nine layers, I need to compute this nine times. Let me try to compute each step one by one.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n1. Compute A = 1 + 3\n   A = 4\n\nNow, moving out one layer:\n2. Compute B = 1 + 3A\n   B = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n3. Compute C = 1 + 3B\n   C = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext:\n4. Compute D = 1 + 3C\n   D = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nContinuing:\n5. Compute E = 1 + 3D\n   E = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext layer:\n6. Compute F = 1 + 3E\n   F = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext:\n7. Compute G = 1 + 3F\n   G = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nContinuing:\n8. Compute H = 1 + 3G\n   H = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext layer:\n9. Compute I = 1 + 3H\n   I = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that. Each time I compute a new layer, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, starting from A=4, then B=13, C=40, D=121, E=364, F=1093, G=3280, H=9841, I=29524. So, after nine layers, the innermost expression becomes 29524. But the original problem is 3 times that expression, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, the very outermost part is 3 multiplied by the result of all those nested parentheses. So, the total value would be 3*I, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524. Let me break this down: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems high, but let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total value is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers. The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Let me see: the innermost is (1+3). Then each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as each \"1+3\" is a new layer, so let me count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try again. The problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count how many times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nLet me see, each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to think that each \"1+3(\" is a layer, so starting from the innermost, there are nine layers because the innermost is 1+3, and each time we add another layer, so the outermost is the ninth layer. Wait, but when I computed earlier, I had nine layers, ending with I=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Let me confirm if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me try to parse the expression again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(something). Let me see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. Next: (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until we have nine layers. So, if I have nine layers, then each step from 1 to 9 would be the layers, as I did earlier. So, A=4, B=13, C=40, D=121, E=364, F=1093, G=3280, H=9841, I=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*I, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nStarting with A=1+3=4.\n\nB=1 + 3*A = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12=13.\n\nC=1 + 3*B=1 + 3*13=1 + 39=40.\n\nD=1 + 3*C=1 + 3*40=1 + 120=121.\n\nE=1 + 3*D=1 + 3*121=1 + 363=364.\n\nF=1 + 3*E=1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093.\n\nG=1 + 3*F=1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280.\n\nH=1 + 3*G=1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841.\n\nI=1 + 3*H=1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*I=3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check each multiplication step:\n\n- 3*4=12, so 1+12=13: correct.\n\n- 3*13=39, so 1+39=40: correct.\n\n- 3*40=120, so 1+120=121: correct.\n\n- 3*121=363, so 1+363=364: correct.\n\n- 3*364=1092, so 1+1092=1093: correct.\n\n- 3*1093=3279, so 1+3279=3280: correct.\n\n- 3*3280=9840, so 1+9840=9841: correct.\n\n- 3*9841=29523, so 1+29523=29524: correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the number seems quite large. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time we do 1 + 3*(previous). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3*a1=1+12=13, a3=1+3*a2=40, etc. So, this seems like a recurrence relation: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nWait, but actually, a1 would be the innermost term, which is 1+3=4, then a2=1+3*a1=13, and so on until a9. Then, the total expression is 3*a9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1=4.\n\nWhen n=1, a1=4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier values.\n\nFor n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4: correct.\n\nn=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13: correct.\n\nn=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40: correct.\n\nn=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121: correct.\n\nn=5: a5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364: correct.\n\nn=6: a6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093: correct.\n\nn=7: a7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280: correct.\n\nn=8: a8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841: correct.\n\nn=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524: correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is a nested expression with n layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), then the total expression would be 3*( (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 ). In this case, n=9, so 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I first started, I considered the innermost expression as a1=4, which is 1+3. Then each subsequent layer is a2=1+3*a1, etc., up to a9. So, the total expression is 3*a9, which is 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (3^{11}-3)/2=(177147-3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, arriving at the same result.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each step again quickly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: Each a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. The answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\(a_n\\), where \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\), and each subsequent layer is computed as \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\).\n\n1.

So, perhaps each layer is built by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then the whole thing is multiplied by 3 again at each step. Hmm, maybe I should write each layer as a function of the previous one.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So, the total value would be 3 * Layer 9.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 +12=88572.\n\nSo, the total value is 88572. Hmm, that seems a bit large, but considering each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it might be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression looks like a geometric series, perhaps. Let me try to model it.\n\nEach layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a_1 is 4, a_2 is 13, etc., up to a_9, which we found as 29524. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if that formula holds.\n\nFor n=1, a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1. But our a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Maybe the formula is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the homogeneous solution is different. Let me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. So, a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nThus, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the step-by-step computation. Let me check a few layers again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524*3:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n29524*3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, 88572. Correct.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4.

    "text": " Let me try to compute this step by step, starting from the innermost part. Let's denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost and Level 9 is the outermost. Let me define each level's value step by step. Level 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, Level 1 = 4. Now, moving to Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1). Since Level 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, Level 2 = 13. Next, Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2). Level 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Level 3 = 40. Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3). Level 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. 1 + 120 is 121. Level 4 = 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4). 3*121 is 363. 1 + 363 is 364. Level 5 = 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5). 3*364 is 1092. 1 + 1092 is 1093. Level 6 = 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6). 3*1093 is 3279. 1 + 3279 is 3280. Level 7 = 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7). 3*3280 is 9840. 1 + 9840 is 9841. Level 8 = 9841. Finally, Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8). 3*9841 is 29523. 1 + 29523 is 29524. Level 9 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Level 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 88572.

Let's number the layers from the inside out as layers 1 to 9. So, layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1), and so on, up to layer 9, which is the outermost, multiplied by 3. Hmm, maybe that's a good approach. Let me try to compute each layer one by one, starting from layer 1.

The original expression is 3 multiplied by (layer 9). So, after computing layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 times 29,000 is 87,000, and 3 times 524 is 1,572. Adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, is the answer 88,572? Let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake along the way.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (That's correct.)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Yes, that's right.)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Still correct.)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Okay, that's good.)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Yes, correct.)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct.)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct.)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, so 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Yes, that's right.)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct.)\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 20000*3 = 60000\n- 9000*3 = 27000\n- 500*3 = 1500\n- 20*3 = 60\n- 4*3 = 12\n\nAdding those together:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait a second, that's 88,572, but when I did it earlier, I thought it was 88,572 as well, but I wrote 88,572. Hmm, but let me check that again because sometimes I might have miscounted commas or something. Let me add 3*29524 step by step:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(...\" is a layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent ( is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. So, each layer from 1 to 9 is as I computed earlier. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, let's find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I used both iterative computation and a closed-form formula to verify the result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute the innermost part first and then work my way outwards. Let me try that. Let's start from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the next layer out is 1 + 3 times that result. So, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result). Wait, let me make sure I'm tracking this correctly. Let me number each layer from the inside out as layers 1 to 9, maybe that will help. So, layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, after computing layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, the final result would be 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break that down. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I did each layer correctly because that's a lot of steps and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again more carefully. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually is manageable. Alternatively, the closed-form formula for a_n would be a_n = (3^n + 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For example, when n=1, a_1 = (3^1 +1)/2 = (3+1)/2 = 2. But wait, our a_1 is 4, not 2. Hmm, so maybe my assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different formula. Let's see. Let me compute a few terms using the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, that's correct. Now, looking for a pattern or a formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. The problem is 3*(a_9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is 3*a_9. So, yes, 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n =3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2= (3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get the same answer, using the formula. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

So, does that mean that the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the total would be 36084?\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...). It seems like there are 9 such layers, each time adding another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, let's compute each step carefully.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: Now, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nStep 3: Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nStep 4: Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nStep 5: Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nStep 6: Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nStep 7: Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nStep 8: Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nStep 9: Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 36084. Let me verify this to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLet me recompute each step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, each step seems correct. Let me check a few steps again to be sure.\n\nFor example, step 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15, that's correct.\n\nStep 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48, correct.\n\nStep 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147, correct.\n\nStep 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444, correct.\n\nStep 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335, correct.\n\nStep 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008, correct.\n\nStep 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027, correct.\n\nStep 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084, correct.\n\nHmm, seems like each step adds up correctly. So, the final result is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times ...))). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, each time, we're adding 1, multiplying by 3, and then moving outward. It's like a geometric series, maybe? Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWait, but in our problem, each layer is 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), so actually, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIf n=1: a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12? Wait, no, that can't be because the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which would be a_2 = 15.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define a_n as the value of the expression with n layers, where each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12? But in our earlier computation, the innermost was (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer was 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which would be a_2 = 15. So, maybe a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12? But that doesn't align with our earlier computation because when we computed the innermost, we treated it as (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer as 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which would be a_2 = 15, a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, etc. So perhaps a_1 = 4, a_2 = 15, a_3 = 48, etc., with a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but that would make a_1 = 4, a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, etc., up to a_9, which would be the value of the entire expression.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the first multiplication by 3 is outside all the parentheses, so perhaps the total expression is a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8), where a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7), and so on, down to a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, so in that case, the total number of layers is 9, so the expression is a_9, where a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I started with (1 + 3) = 4 as a_1, then a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, etc., up to a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, but if I model this as a recurrence relation, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4, then I can compute a_2 = 15, a_3 = 48, a_4 = 147, a_5 = 444, a_6 = 1335, a_7 = 4008, a_8 = 12027, a_9 = 36084.\n\nSo, that seems consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, for n \u2265 2\n\nWith a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 3 \u21d2 -2*C = 3 \u21d2 C = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 3/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 \u21d2 A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nLet me compute a_1 with this formula:\n\na_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - 3/2 = 30/2 = 15, which matches.\n\na_3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = (99/2) - 3/2 = 96/2 = 48, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n = 9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, 3^9 = 19683\n\nNow, compute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = ?\n\nCompute 3280.5 * 10 = 32805\n\n3280.5 * 1 = 3280.5\n\nAdd them together: 32805 + 3280.5 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084\n\nSo, a_9 = 36084, which matches our earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36,084.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute it using the formula again.\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9 = 19683\n\n11/6 * 19683 = (11 * 19683)/6\n\n11 * 19683: Let's compute 10*19683 = 196830, plus 1*19683 = 19683, so total is 196830 + 19683 = 216513\n\nNow, 216513 \u00f7 6 = 36085.5\n\nThen, subtract 3/2 = 1.5: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result, 36,084.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by computing from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute this by starting from the innermost part and working my way out. Let me define each layer as a step. Let me assign variables to each nested expression to make it easier. Let's say: Let\u2019s define a\u2081 as the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3. Then, a\u2082 would be 1 + 3a\u2081, a\u2083 would be 1 + 3a\u2082, and so on, up to a\u2089, which would be the outermost expression. Then, the entire problem is 3 times a\u2089. So, the problem is 3a\u2089. Let me try to compute each a\u2081 through a\u2089 step by step. Starting with a\u2081: a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081. Since a\u2081 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to a\u2083: a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082. We know a\u2082 is 13, so 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so a\u2083 is 40. Next, a\u2084 = 1 + 3a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. So, a\u2084 is 121. Now, a\u2085 = 1 + 3a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, and 3*1 is 3, so total is 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, a\u2085 = 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, moving on to a\u2086: a\u2086 = 1 + 3a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, a\u2086 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next, a\u2087 = 1 + 3a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Therefore, a\u2087 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Now, a\u2088 = 1 + 3a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, a\u2088 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, a\u2089 = 1 + 3a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Therefore, a\u2089 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from a\u2081: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. a\u2082: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. a\u2083: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. a\u2084: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. a\u2085: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. a\u2086: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. a\u2087: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. a\u2088: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. a\u2089: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I could have used instead of computing each step manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or something. Each a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting with a\u2081 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a\u2099. The recurrence is a\u2099 = 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1, with a\u2081 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a\u2099^h = C*3\u207f. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a\u2099^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a\u2099 = C*3\u207f - 1/2. Applying initial condition a\u2081 = 4: 4 = C*3\u00b9 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2. So, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with a\u2081: (3\u00b2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. a\u2082: (3\u00b3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. a\u2083: (3\u2074 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2. Let me compute 3\u00b9\u2070. 3\u00b9 = 3, 3\u00b2 = 9, 3\u00b3 = 27, 3\u2074 = 81, 3\u2075 = 243, 3\u2076 = 729, 3\u2077 = 2187, 3\u2078 = 6561, 3\u2079 = 19683, 3\u00b9\u2070 = 59049. So, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). If I let x = 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3x, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3x) = 1 + 3 + 9x, and so on. But I think the recurrence relation approach is clearer here. So, in conclusion, after computing each step carefully and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. By defining each layer recursively and using a closed-form formula, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Define each nested expression recursively as a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting with a\u2081 = 4.\n2. Compute each a\u2099 step by step up to a\u2089.\n3. Use the closed-form formula a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2 to find a\u2089 = 29524.\n4. Multiply a\u2089 by 3 to get the final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can define this recursively or find a pattern. Let me try to compute the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let's start from the innermost parentheses: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result of the innermost). So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, the next result is 40. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Let me see if this continues in a similar fashion. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40). Compute that: 3*40 = 120, 1 + 120 = 121. So, 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). Let's compute that: 3*121 = 363, 1 + 363 = 364. So, 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is... Let's compute 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Next layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Compute 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might be a bit messy. Alternatively, 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. But actually, I think I need to compute it step by step. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\ntimes 3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n29524\n*    3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, because 29524 * 3 is 88572.\n\nSo, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, but hold on, I thought earlier layers were giving me numbers like 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. So, now, the next layer is 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nThen, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute that: 3*88573. Let me calculate that. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, 240000 + 24000 = 264000, 264000 + 1500 = 265500, 265500 + 210 = 265710, 265710 + 9 = 265719.

Let's compute that: 3*265720. Let me calculate that. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60.

Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nWait, let me check 265720*3. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, 600000 + 180000 = 780000, 780000 + 15000 = 795000, 795000 + 2100 = 797100, 797100 + 60 = 797160. So, 265720*3=797160, plus 1 is 797161.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(797161). Let's compute that: 3*797161. Let me compute 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. So, adding these up: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, 2370000 + 21000 = 2391000, 2391000 + 300 = 2391300, 2391300 + 180 = 2391480, 2391480 + 3 = 2391483. Then, 1 + 2391483 = 2391484.\n\nWait, let me verify 797161*3. 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. So, 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, 2370000 + 21000 = 2391000, 2391000 + 300 = 2391300, 2391300 + 180 = 2391480, 2391480 + 3 = 2391483. So, 797161*3=2391483, plus 1 is 2391484.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(2391484). Let's compute that: 3*2391484. Let me compute 2000000*3=6000000, 300000*3=900000, 90000*3=270000, 1000*3=3000, 400*3=1200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. So, adding these up: 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000, 6900000 + 270000 = 7170000, 7170000 + 3000 = 7173000, 7173000 + 1200 = 7174200, 7174200 + 240 = 7174440, 7174440 + 12 = 7174452. Then, 1 + 7174452 = 7174453.\n\nWait, let me check 2391484*3. 2000000*3=6000000, 300000*3=900000, 90000*3=270000, 1000*3=3000, 400*3=1200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. So, adding them up: 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000, 6900000 + 270000 = 7170000, 7170000 + 3000 = 7173000, 7173000 + 1200 = 7174200, 7174200 + 240 = 7174440, 7174440 + 12 = 7174452. Then, 1 + 7174452 = 7174453.\n\nFinally, moving out to the outermost layer, we have 1 + 3*(7174453). Let me compute that: 3*7174453. Let me compute 7000000*3=21000000, 100000*3=300000, 70000*3=210000, 4000*3=12000, 400*3=1200, 50*3=150, 3*3=9. So, adding these up: 21000000 + 300000 = 21300000, 21300000 + 210000 = 21510000, 21510000 + 12000 = 21522000, 21522000 + 1200 = 21523200, 21523200 + 150 = 21523350, 21523350 + 9 = 21523359. Then, 1 + 21523359 = 21523360.\n\nWait, let me verify 7174453*3. 7000000*3=21000000, 100000*3=300000, 70000*3=210000, 4000*3=12000, 400*3=1200, 50*3=150, 3*3=9. So, adding them up: 21000000 + 300000 = 21300000, 21300000 + 210000 = 21510000, 21510000 + 12000 = 21522000, 21522000 + 1200 = 21523200, 21523200 + 150 = 21523350, 21523350 + 9 = 21523359. Then, 1 + 21523359 = 21523360.\n\nSo, that's the result inside the outermost parentheses: 21523360. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times that, right? Because the original problem is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*(21523360). Let me compute that: 21523360*3. Let me compute 20000000*3=60000000, 1000000*3=3000000, 500000*3=1500000, 20000*3=60000, 3000*3=9000, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 0*3=0. Wait, but 21523360 is 21,523,360. So, 20,000,000*3=60,000,000, 1,000,000*3=3,000,000, 500,000*3=1,500,000, 20,000*3=60,000, 3,000*3=9,000, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 0*3=0. Adding these up: 60,000,000 + 3,000,000 = 63,000,000, 63,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 64,500,000, 64,500,000 + 60,000 = 64,560,000, 64,560,000 + 9,000 = 64,569,000, 64,569,000 + 900 = 64,569,900, 64,569,900 + 180 = 64,570,080, and then +0 remains 64,570,080.\n\nWait, but let me compute it digit by digit to make sure:\n\n21,523,360\ntimes 3\n----------\n0*3=0\n6*3=18, write down 8, carry over 1\n3*3=9 +1=10, write down 0, carry over 1\n3*3=9 +1=10, write down 0, carry over 1\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n1*3=3, write down 3\n2*3=6, write down 6\n\nWait, actually, that might not be correct because I'm multiplying each digit starting from the right. Let me do it properly:\n\n21,523,360\n*          3\n------------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n0*3=0\n6*3=18, write 8, carry 1\n3*3=9 +1=10, write 0, carry 1\n3*3=9 +1=10, write 0, carry 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\n1*3=3\n2*3=6\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n0\n8\n0\n0\n7\n5\n7\n3\n6\n\nBut that seems off because when you write it, it should be 64,570,080. Let me check:\n\n21,523,360\n*          3\n------------\n= 64,570,080\n\nYes, because 21,523,360 * 3 is 64,570,080. So, that's the final result.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again because this is a lot of computation, and it's easy to make a mistake. So, let me verify the steps again.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*(88573) = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n12. 1 + 3*(265720) = 1 + 797160 = 797161\n13. 1 + 3*(797161) = 1 + 2391483 = 2391484\n14. 1 + 3*(2391484) = 1 + 7174452 = 7174453\n15. 1 + 3*(7174453) = 1 + 21523359 = 21523360\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(21523360) = 64,570,080.\n\nWait, but let me check the step where I went from 7174453 to 21523359. So, 7174453*3: Let's compute that again.\n\n7174453\n*        3\n----------\n3*3=9\n3*5=15, write 5, carry 1\n3*4=12 +1=13, write 3, carry 1\n3*7=21 +1=22, write 2, carry 2\n3*4=12 +2=14, write 4, carry 1\n3*1=3 +1=4\n3*7=21\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me do it properly:\n\n7174453\n*        3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n3*3=9\n3*5=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n3*4=12 +1=13, write down 3, carry over 1\n3*7=21 +1=22, write down 2, carry over 2\n3*4=12 +2=14, write down 4, carry over 1\n3*1=3 +1=4\n3*7=21\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n9\n5\n3\n2\n4\n4\n21\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because when you write the numbers, it should be:\n\nStarting from the right:\nDigit 1: 3*3=9\nDigit 2: 3*5=15, write 5, carry 1\nDigit 3: 3*4=12 +1=13, write 3, carry 1\nDigit 4: 3*7=21 +1=22, write 2, carry 2\nDigit 5: 3*4=12 +2=14, write 4, carry 1\nDigit 6: 3*1=3 +1=4\nDigit 7: 3*7=21\n\nSo, writing the number from top to bottom:\n\n21 (from digit 7)\n4 (from digit 6)\n4 (from digit 5)\n2 (from digit 4)\n3 (from digit 3)\n5 (from digit 2)\n9 (from digit 1)\n\nWait, that can't be right because when you multiply, you write the digits from right to left, so the result should be 21,442,359? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it properly.\n\nWait, 7174453 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 7,000,000 * 3 = 21,000,000\n174,453 * 3 = ?\n\nWait, 174,453 * 3:\n\n100,000 *3=300,000\n70,000 *3=210,000\n4,000 *3=12,000\n400 *3=1,200\n50 *3=150\n3 *3=9\n\nSo, 300,000 + 210,000 = 510,000\n510,000 +12,000=522,000\n522,000 +1,200=523,200\n523,200 +150=523,350\n523,350 +9=523,359\n\nSo, 174,453 *3=523,359\n\nTherefore, 7,174,453 *3=21,000,000 + 523,359=21,523,359\n\nWait, that's different from what I had before. Earlier, I thought it was 21,523,359, but when I did the digit-by-digit, I got confused. So, 7,174,453 *3=21,523,359. Therefore, 1 + 21,523,359=21,523,360.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication is 3*21,523,360=64,570,080.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought I had 21,523,359, I added 1 to get 21,523,360, which is correct. Then, 3*21,523,360=64,570,080.\n\nBut let me confirm 21,523,360*3:\n\n21,523,360\n*          3\n------------\n60*3=180, write down 0, carry over 18\n300*3=900 +18=918, write down 8, carry over 91\n3,000*3=9,000 +91=9,091, write down 1, carry over 909\n20,000*3=60,000 +909=60,909, write down 909, carry over 60\n500,000*3=1,500,000 +60=1,500,060, write down 060, carry over 1,500\n1,000,000*3=3,000,000 +1,500=3,001,500, write down 1,500\n20,000,000*3=60,000,000 +3,001,500=63,001,500\n\nWait, that seems messy. Alternatively, 21,523,360 *3:\n\n20,000,000 *3=60,000,000\n1,523,360 *3=4,570,080\nSo, 60,000,000 +4,570,080=64,570,080.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, I arrive at the final result of 64,570,080.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Start with the innermost (1+3)=4\n2. Next layer: 1+3*4=13\n3. Next:1+3*13=40\n4. Next:1+3*40=121\n5. Next:1+3*121=364\n6. Next:1+3*364=1093\n7. Next:1+3*1093=3280\n8. Next:1+3*3280=9841\n9. Next:1+3*9841=29524\n10. Next:1+3*29524=88573\n11. Next:1+3*88573=265720\n12. Next:1+3*265720=797161\n13. Next:1+3*797161=2391484\n14. Next:1+3*2391484=7174453\n15. Next:1+3*7174453=21523360\n16. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*21523360=64570080\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I did each step correctly, so I'm confident that the answer is 64,570,080.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{64570080}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute the innermost part first and then build my way up. Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost to keep track. Let's denote the innermost expression as E1, then the next one as E2, and so on until E9, which is the outermost expression. So, starting from E1: E1 = 1 + 3. That's simple enough. E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving outward, E2 would be 1 + 3 times E1. So, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that's E2. Now, E3 is 1 + 3*E2. Substituting E2's value, E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's a bigger jump. Let's keep going. E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 is 1092, so E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate that: 3*9841 is... let's see, 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. But wait, hold on. The original problem isn't just E9; it's 3 times E9. Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, the final value is 3*E9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from E1: 1+3=4. Correct. E2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. E3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. E4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. E5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. E6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. E7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. E8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. E9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me count again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1 + 3(...\" is a layer. Let's see: 3(1 + 3(...)) so that's one layer. Then inside, another 3(...), so that's two layers, and so on. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3. Then, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let's write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections: Starting from the innermost, the first is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3. So, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until we have nine layers. Wait, actually, each opening parenthesis adds another layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses beyond the first 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. The first opening parenthesis after 3 is for the first 1 + 3(...).\n2. Then, inside that, another opening parenthesis for the next 1 + 3(...).\n3. This continues until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer, and there are nine such layers because starting from the innermost, we have 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3. Wait, no, actually, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer above adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The first \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3.\n2. Then another \"1 + 3(\" inside that.\n3. Repeating until the innermost.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, which doesn't have another \"1 + 3(\" inside it. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" expressions:\n\n- The first is 3(1 + 3(...))\n- Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n- This continues until the innermost, which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"1 + 3(\" which is 9 times. Wait, no, let's see: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer above adds another \"1 + 3(...)\", so the number of layers is 9? Or is it 8?\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as starting from the innermost as layer 1, then each layer above is layer 2, up to layer 9. But when I computed earlier, I had E1 to E9, each building on the previous. So, if I have E1 = 1 + 3, E2 = 1 + 3*E1, up to E9, then the outermost expression is 3*E9. So, that would mean there are 9 layers, each building on the previous. So, the initial computation was correct with 9 layers, leading to E9 = 29524, and then 3*E9 = 88572.\n\nBut let me verify that by actually computing each layer step by step, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations.\n\nStarting over:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds correctly on the previous one, so I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula to compute it without manually calculating each layer. Let's see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the values of E1 to E9:\n\nE1 = 4\n\nE2 = 13\n\nE3 = 40\n\nE4 = 121\n\nE5 = 364\n\nE6 = 1093\n\nE7 = 3280\n\nE8 = 9841\n\nE9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, E(n) = 3*E(n-1) + 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E(n).\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is E(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWe have E(1) = 4. Let's plug in n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4.\n\nWe also need another condition. Let's compute E(2) using the recurrence:\n\nE(2) = 3*E(1) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13.\n\nNow, using n=2:\n\nE(2) = A*3^2 + B => 9A + B = 13.\n\nSo, we have the system:\n\n3A + B = 4\n\n9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nThen, substituting A back into the first equation:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, E(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nE(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nE(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nE(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nE(4) = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nE(5) = (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nE(6)=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\nE(7)=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\nE(8)=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\nE(9)=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, E(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nGiven that, E9 is (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3*E9 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nBut 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, used a recurrence relation to find a formula, and confirmed that the result is consistent both by direct computation and by using the formula. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner layer. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward is Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9.

So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*(29524) would be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (That's straightforward.)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Okay, correct.)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Still good.)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct.)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Yes.)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (That's right.)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct.)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Yes.)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Okay.)\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that:\n\n3*29524: \n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n3*500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n3*24 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to be absolutely sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's test that. Let me assume L_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nAt n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1.\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. Let me see.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, that's 3*L_9.\n\nFrom the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147.\n\nThus, 3*L_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I can directly compute the answer without having to compute each layer step by step.\n\nBut since I was able to compute it both ways, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me define each level mathematically. Let's say that at each level n, the expression is 1 + 3 * (expression from level n+1). So, starting from the innermost, Level 1 would be 1 + 3, because there are no more parentheses inside. Let me compute that first. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one level out, Level 2 would be 1 + 3 * (Level 1). So, substituting Level 1's value: Level 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Level 3 would be 1 + 3*(Level 2). So, Level 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's see Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, it's growing exponentially. Level 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, this is getting large quickly. Level 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, Level 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, remember that the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9. So, the final computation would be: 3 * (Level 9) = 3 * 29524.

Then, after getting Level 9's value, which is 29,524, I multiplied it by 3 to get the final result.

Let's say the innermost part is layer 1, then moving outward, each subsequent layer is layer 2, 3, and so on up to layer 9. So, layer 1: 1 + 3. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2). And this continues until layer 9, which is the outermost one, and then we multiply that result by 3. So, let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1). Since layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, layer 2 is 13. Moving on to layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate that: 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, adding 1 gives us 364. So, layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, and 3*3 = 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute that. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, and 3*1 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by layer 9. So, we have 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Adding them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that matches my earlier result. So, I think I did that correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern I can recognize here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote the nth layer as L_n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. Let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, either method works. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each level is 1 plus three times the next level. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, I was able to find a formula to compute the value without manually calculating each layer, which would have been time-consuming and prone to error.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\). Starting from the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nUsing the recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\( L_n \\) can be expressed as \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For layer 9, this gives:\n\n\\[ L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, since it's nested, maybe it's the other way around. The innermost part is the last one, so L9 is the innermost. Let me try to clarify that. Let me count the number of 3s and see. Alternatively, maybe I can define each layer as starting from the innermost and moving outward. So, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost). Let me try to compute that. Let's define each level step by step. Let me write down each step:\n\nStart from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times this entire expression.

Let me go back through each level to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40.

Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. 29524 *3. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add them:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 +29524:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nAdding digit by digit:\n\n8 +4=12 \u21922, carryover 1.\n\n4+2=6 +1=7.\n\n0+5=5.\n\n9+9=18 \u21928, carryover 1.\n\n5+2=7 +1=8.\n\nSo, 59048 +29524=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a smarter way to compute this without computing each level step by step? Maybe using a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a formula, especially if it's a geometric series. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this problem, each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, if I denote each level as L_n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, L_1 is the innermost, which is (1 +3)=4, then L_2=1 +3*L1=13, etc.\n\nSo, the general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n^{(p)}=K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K -3K =1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Wait, but when n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: L1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for each level n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost level is level 9, so L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to compute this without using the formula, but step by step as I did before, which also gave me the same result.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Maybe it's a recursive structure where each step depends on the previous one. Let me try to simplify it by starting from the innermost part. Let's define each nested part as a separate term. Let me denote each inner expression as E1, E2, E3, up to E9, where E9 is the innermost one. So, starting from the inside: E9 = 1 + 3. That's simple enough. Then E8 = 1 + 3*E9. Then E7 = 1 + 3*E8, and so on, until E1, which is the outermost expression. So, if I can compute each E from E9 up to E1, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let me start computing each E step by step.\n\nFirst, E9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E8 = 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, E7 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. The entire expression is 3*(E1), right? Because the outermost term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing E1, which is 29524, the final result is 3*E1 = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,000 * 3 = 87,000. 524 * 3 = 1,572. Adding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, is the final answer 88,572? Hmm, that seems quite large.

Let me compute this again: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, the final answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine levels of nesting. So, when I computed E1 as 29,524, that was the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, the total expression is 3 times E1, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each step is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. So, starting from E9 = 4, each subsequent E is 1 + 3 times the previous E. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for E_n = a + b*E_{n-1} is E_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + C, where C is a constant if the recurrence is homogeneous. Wait, actually, let me recall the standard solution method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute it step by step as I did before, especially since there are only nine terms. But just to make sure, let me see if there's a pattern in the numbers I got:\n\nE9 = 4\n\nE8 = 13\n\nE7 = 40\n\nE6 = 121\n\nE5 = 364\n\nE4 = 1093\n\nE3 = 3280\n\nE2 = 9841\n\nE1 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1. Wait, no, actually, E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. So, it's E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. Let's take n=9: E9 = 4 = C*3^9 - 1/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, 4 = C*19683 - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC*19683 = 4 + 1/2 = 4.5 = 9/2.\n\nSo, C = (9/2)/19683 = (9)/(2*19683) = 9/39366 = 1/4374.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = (1/4374)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nBut let me check if this works for n=9:\n\nE9 = (1/4374)*19683 - 1/2.\n\n19683 / 4374: Let's compute that. 4374 * 4 = 17496. 19683 - 17496 = 2187. 2187 / 4374 = 0.5. So, 19683 / 4374 = 4.5.\n\nSo, E9 = 4.5 - 0.5 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=8:\n\nE8 = (1/4374)*3^8 - 1/2.\n\n3^8 = 6561.\n\n6561 / 4374 = 1.5. So, E8 = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1. Wait, but E8 is 13, not 1. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in the general solution?\n\nWait, I think I messed up the indexing. Because in the problem, E9 is the innermost term, but in the recurrence relation, I might have considered E1 as the first term. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the problem, E9 is the innermost, so when n=9, E9=4. But in the recurrence, if I consider E1 as the first term, then E1 would correspond to n=1. So, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should define E_n where n=1 corresponds to the innermost expression. Let me redefine:\n\nLet E1 = 1 + 3.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2.\n\n...\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8.\n\nSo, in this case, E1 = 4, E2=13, E3=40, etc., as computed earlier.\n\nSo, in this case, the recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1=4.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a particular solution.\n\nWait, let's try solving it again with this indexing.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, with E1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 1, we can try E_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C = 4.5 => C = 1.5.\n\nSo, the solution is E_n = 1.5*3^n - 0.5.\n\nLet's check for n=1: E1 = 1.5*3 - 0.5 = 4.5 - 0.5 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E2 = 1.5*9 - 0.5 = 13.5 - 0.5 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: E3 = 1.5*27 - 0.5 = 40.5 - 0.5 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: 1.5*81 - 0.5 = 121.5 - 0.5 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: 1.5*243 - 0.5 = 364.5 - 0.5 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: 1.5*729 - 0.5 = 1093.5 - 0.5 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: 1.5*2187 - 0.5 = 3280.5 - 0.5 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: 1.5*6561 - 0.5 = 9841.5 - 0.5 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: 1.5*19683 - 0.5 = 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, E1 (the outermost expression) is E9 in the original problem, but wait, no. Wait, in our redefined terms, E1 was the innermost, so E9 is the outermost. Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine levels. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's E1=4, then E2=13, up to E9=29524. So, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, E9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, total expression is 3*E9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression as starting from the innermost, which is E1=4, then the outermost is E9=29524, so the total is 3*E9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the number of multiplications, since each 3 is multiplied by the next term, it's a geometric series.\n\nWait, but let me think about this another way. Maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nLooking at the structure: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nEach time, we have a 1 plus 3 times the next level. So, it's like each level contributes 1 and then multiplies by 3 for the next level.\n\nSo, if I expand it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))).\n\nIf I keep expanding this, it's going to be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nFirst term: 3*1.\n\nSecond term: 3*3*1.\n\nThird term: 3*3*3*1.\n\n...\n\nNinth term: 3^9*1.\n\nSo, the total expression is the sum from k=1 to k=9 of 3^k.\n\nBecause each term is 3 multiplied k times, where k is the level.\n\nSo, the sum is 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9.\n\nThis is a geometric series with first term a=3, common ratio r=3, and number of terms n=9.\n\nThe sum S of a geometric series is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nPlugging in the values: S = 3*(3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3*(19683 - 1)/2 = 3*(19682)/2 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but the total expression is 3*(E1), where E1 was 29524. But according to this, the sum is 29523. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the expression as a sum. Let me see.\n\nWait, actually, when I expand the expression, it's not exactly the sum from k=1 to k=9 of 3^k because each term is nested within the previous one. Let me think about it again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which when expanded is 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine 3s. So, it's 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 3^9.\n\nSo, that is indeed the sum from k=1 to k=9 of 3^k.\n\nBut according to the geometric series formula, that sum is (3*(3^9 - 1))/(3 - 1) = (3*19682)/2 = 29523.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed step by step, I got 3*E1 = 88572, which is 3*29524 = 88572. But according to the geometric series, the sum is 29523, which is one less than 29524. So, where is the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of terms. Let me check the expansion again.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))).\n\nLet me count the number of 3s in each term:\n\n- The first 3 is multiplied by 1, so that's 3^1.\n\n- The next term is 3*3*1, which is 3^2.\n\n- Then 3*3*3*1 = 3^3.\n\n- This continues until the innermost term, which is 3*3*...*3 with nine 3s.\n\nWait, but the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each step adds another 3 multiplier.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of terms is actually ten, not nine. Because starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's one term. Then each layer adds another multiplier. Let me see:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (E1=4).\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, there are nine E terms, from E1 to E9, each corresponding to one layer of nesting. Therefore, the total expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut when I tried to model it as a geometric series, I considered the sum from k=1 to k=9 of 3^k, which gave me 29523, which is exactly E9 - 1. Because E9 = 29524, which is 29523 + 1.\n\nSo, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps because in the geometric series approach, I didn't account for the initial 1 in each term. Let me think.\n\nEach E_n is 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. So, when expanding E9, it's 1 + 3*E8, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E7), and so on, until E1=1 + 3.\n\nSo, when fully expanded, E9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8.\n\nWait, that's a sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k.\n\nBecause starting from E1=1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1.\n\nThen E2=1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nE3=1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nAnd so on, until E9=1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8.\n\nSo, E9 is the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWait, but earlier we had E9=29524. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, E9 is 1 + 3*E8, and E8 is 1 + 3*E7, etc., down to E1=1 + 3.\n\nSo, E1=1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE2=1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE3=1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nE4=1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nE5=1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nE6=1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nE7=1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nE8=1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nE9=1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, E9 is 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841. But according to the geometric series, if E9 is the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, which is 9841, but in reality, E9 is 29524.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake in interpreting E9 as a geometric series. Let me clarify.\n\nEach E_n is 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. So, starting from E1=4, each subsequent E_n adds another term in the form of 3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nSo, each E_n is 1 + 3*(previous sum). So, it's not a simple geometric series, but rather each step adds 1 and multiplies by 3.\n\nBut we can express E_n as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we derived earlier. So, for n=9, E9=(3^{10} - 1)/2=(59049 - 1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nSo, E9=29524, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought of it as a geometric series, I considered the sum from k=1 to k=9 of 3^k, which is 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 19683, which sums to (3*(3^9 - 1))/2=29523. But that's not the same as E9=29524.\n\nWait, so why is there a difference? Because the sum from k=1 to k=9 of 3^k is 29523, which is exactly E9 -1.\n\nSo, E9=29524=29523 +1, which makes sense because E9=1 + 3*E8, and E8=9841, which is the sum from k=0 to k=7 of 3^k.\n\nWait, no, E8=9841, which is (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Wait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, no, E8=9841, which according to our formula is (3^{9} -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, E9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nSo, the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nBut in our problem, E9 is the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/2=9841.\n\nWait, but in our earlier step-by-step computation, E9=29524, which is actually the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k.\n\nWait, so I think I'm getting confused with the indices.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nIf we define E_n as the sum from k=0 to k=n-1 of 3^k, then E_n=(3^n -1)/2.\n\nBut in our problem, E1=4=(3^2 -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nE2=13=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nE3=40=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, in general, E_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, no, because E1=(3^{2} -1)/2=4.\n\nE2=(3^{3}-1)/2=13.\n\nE3=(3^{4}-1)/2=40.\n\nSo, E_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways now: step-by-step computation, using the recurrence relation, and modeling it as a geometric series. All approaches lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and then work my way outwards. Let me start from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so that layer is 40. Continuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, that's 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). Calculating that: 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Alright, that's 364. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let me see: 3*364. Hmm, 364 times 3. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that layer is 1093. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280. Moving outward again, the next expression is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me calculate that: 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that's 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that's 29524. Now, moving out another layer, the expression is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that's 88573. Now, we're at the outermost layer, right? Wait, let me check: the original expression had nine sets of parentheses, and I think I've worked through nine layers. Let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, that's only eight layers. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses: each 1 + 3(...). So, each step is one layer, so I think I did nine layers. Let me recount:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nWait, that's nine layers. So, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which is 29524. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems quite large. Let me double-check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 + 3*364: 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 + 3*1093: 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 + 3*3280: 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 1 + 3*9841: 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3 * 29524. Let's compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n- 20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me write out the terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, rewrite the recurrence as:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 \u00d7 3 = (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's a bit convoluted, but let me check:\n\n30000 \u00d7 3 = 90000\n\n476 \u00d7 3 = 1428\n\nSo, 29524 = 30000 - 476\n\nThus, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nYes, that works too.\n\nSo, all methods confirm that 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break it down step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Substitute back and evaluate the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Substitute back and evaluate the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4.

Substitute back and evaluate the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Substitute back and evaluate the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Substitute back and evaluate the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Substitute back and evaluate the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost multiplication:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9. Wait, but actually, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, so maybe it's better to think of it as 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, perhaps I should compute Layer 1 first and then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives us 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's do the multiplication step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8.\n- 9*3 = 27, write down 27.\n\nWait, actually, let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 0.\nNow, there are no more digits, so the carried over 0 is not needed.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the multiplication:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each layer builds correctly on the previous one. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are 9 layers, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here.\n\nLet me consider that each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let's define the layers recursively. Let\u2019s denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for Ln. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, whose solution is Ln = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: L9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, Layer 9 is 29524, as I calculated before. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and this repeats 9 times. So, it's like a geometric series with ratio 3, but nested.\n\nWait, but the formula I derived earlier gives us a way to compute it directly without expanding all layers. So, perhaps that's a more efficient method.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed with a formula. Using this formula, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Recognize the nested pattern and compute each layer from the inside out.\n2. Each layer follows the recurrence relation Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1.\n3. Derive the closed-form formula Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n4. Compute the innermost layer (Layer 1) as 4.\n5. Continue computing each subsequent layer up to Layer 9, which equals 29524.\n6. Multiply Layer 9 by 3 to get the final result: 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me start by identifying the innermost expression. The innermost part is 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. Let's compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so now we're at 40. Continuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(40). Let me calculate that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, that's 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). Calculating that: 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. So, moving up, the next layer is 364. Then, the next one is 1 + 3*(364). Let's see: 3*364 = 1092, and 1 + 1092 = 1093. That's 1093. Continuing, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(1093). Calculating that: 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, now we're at 3280. Next, moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute that: 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841. That's 9841. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(9841). Calculating that: 3*9841 = 29523, and 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, now we're at 29524. Moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572, then 1 + 88572 = 88573. That's 88573. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(88573). So, 3*88573. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 88,573 times 3. Let's break it down: 80,000*3 = 240,000; 8,000*3 = 24,000; 500*3 = 1,500; 70*3 = 210; 3*3 = 9. Now, adding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. So, 3*88,573 = 265,719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265,719. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then, 1+3*4=13.

    "text": " Maybe I can define a recursive formula here. Let me denote each inner expression as a term, say a_n, where n is the number of layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3. Let's compute that first. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from innermost layer). So, next layer:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, that seems right. So each time, we take the previous result, multiply by 3, add 1, and that's the next layer's value. Let me check that again. So, if I denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, so if I can compute each a_n step by step, then I can work my way out from the innermost parentheses to the outermost one. Let me count how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so maybe there are 9 layers? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine 1 + 3*(...) parts. So, yes, 9 layers. So, I can compute a_1 to a_9, where each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the end. Let me make sure I'm accounting for that. So, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result of the innermost expression. So, I need to compute a_1 to a_9, then multiply the last one by 3. Wait, no, actually, looking back, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, but the computation starts with a_1 and goes up to a_9, each time building on the previous. Let me try to compute each a_n step by step.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(a_9). So, the total value is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me calculate 29524*3.\n\nFirst, 29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u21927.\n\n5 *3=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my a_n calculations because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in the a_n steps. Let me go through each a_n again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting again:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, each a_n is correct up to a_9 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new layer, so a_1 to a_9. So, the outermost 3 is multiplied by a_9, which is correct. So, the total value is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 88,572 seems like a big number, so maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try computing a_7 again to see if I messed up somewhere.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. That's correct.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to see if I can find a pattern or formula for a_n to avoid computing each step manually. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions.\n\nThe general form of a linear recurrence is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c and d are constants. In this case, c=3 and d=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c), provided that c \u2260 1.\n\nWait, let me check: The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*c^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = c*A + d \u2192 A - c*A = d \u2192 A*(1 - c) = d \u2192 A = d/(1 - c).\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*c^{n} + d/(1 - c).\n\nApplying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*c^{1} + d/(1 - c).\n\nSo, 4 = A*3 + 1/(1 - 3) = 3A + 1/(-2) = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} + 1/(1 - 3) = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed a_n values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3^{10} to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm 3*29524. Let me compute 29,524 *3 again:\n\n29,524 *3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88,572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 *3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first parenthesis:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each corresponding to a_n from 1 to 9. So, a_9 is the innermost expression, and the outermost 3 is multiplied by a_9, giving 3*a_9=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we found that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59,049, so 3^11=177,147.\n\nThen, (177,147 -3)/2 =177,144/2=88,572. So, same result.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, whether I compute each a_n step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each term until reaching the outermost layer. Using the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we find that each term can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524. Multiplying this by the outermost 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's define each innermost expression as a variable to make it easier.

Hmm, maybe I should count the number of E's. Let me see: Each time, starting from E\u2081, each subsequent E is 1 + 3 times the previous E.

So, the total expression is 3*E\u2089, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000.\n\n3*9000 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n3*500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n3*24 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, but wait a second, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again because 3*29524 should be computed correctly.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me double-check each E step because maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me go through each E again:\n\nE\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Correct.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me check if I counted the number of E's correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each adding another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from E\u2081 up to E\u2089, each time we're adding one more layer. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(E\u2089), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of 3(...) terms in the original expression to make sure I didn't miscount. Let me write the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3\n2. 1 + 3(3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(3))\n...\nEach time, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Each time, the expression is 1 + 3(...), and each time, the ... is another 1 + 3(...). So, the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )) with how many layers?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first 3 is outside, then inside is (1 + 3(...)), and each time, inside each 3(...) is another (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, E\u2081 to E\u2089, as I did before. Therefore, the outermost is 3*(E\u2089), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression step by step manually, without using the E notation, to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost part is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can check with a smaller version of the problem to see if my method is correct.\n\nLet's say I have a smaller version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, computing step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\n= 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))\n\n= 3(1 + 3(1 + 12))\n\n= 3(1 + 3*13)\n\n= 3(1 + 39)\n\n= 3*40 = 120.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my method works for a smaller case. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem, I get 88572.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a smaller example, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Maybe I can represent this as a recursive function or something. Let me think. Let's define each inner expression as a term. Let me denote the innermost expression as a base case and work my way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3), right? That's at the very end. Let's compute that first. So, (1 + 3) is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, now we have 40. Continuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*40. Let's see: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Next, 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Then, moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Next, 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Next, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9524 is... wait, maybe I should compute it differently. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Adding 1 gives 88573. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute that: 3*88573. Let me break this down: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 73*3=219. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000; 264000 + 1500 = 265500; 265500 + 219 = 265719. Adding 1 gives 265720. Finally, the outermost layer is 3 times this result. So, 3*265720. Let's compute that: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Wait, no, 265720 is 200000 + 60000 + 5000 + 700 + 20. So, each part multiplied by 3: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Now, adding all those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000; 780000 + 15000 = 795000; 795000 + 2100 = 797100; 797100 + 60 = 797160. So, 3*265720 is 797160. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 797,160. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4. Then, 1+3*4=13. Then, 1+3*13=40. Then, 1+3*40=121. Next, 1+3*121=364. Then, 1+3*364=1093. Next, 1+3*1093=3280. Then, 1+3*3280=9841. Next, 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 1+3*29524=88573. Next, 1+3*88573=265720. Finally, 3*265720=797,160. Hmm, that seems consistent. Each step, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1, except for the very last step where I just multiplied by 3. So, each time, except the last, it's 1 + 3*(previous). The last step is 3*(previous). So, yeah, that seems correct. I think I did each multiplication correctly. Let me just check a couple of the larger multiplications to be sure. For example, when I had 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. That's correct. Then, 3*88573: 88573*3. Let me compute that: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 73*3=219. Adding them: 240000 + 24000 = 264000; 264000 + 1500 = 265500; 265500 + 219 = 265719. Adding 1 gives 265720. Correct. Then, 3*265720: 265720*3. Let's compute that: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding them: 600000 + 180000 = 780000; 780000 + 15000 = 795000; 795000 + 2100 = 797100; 797100 + 60 = 797160. Yep, that's correct. So, after going through each step carefully and double-checking the multiplications, I'm confident that the final result is 797,160.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let's define each layer as a function. Let me think of it recursively. Let me denote each innermost expression as a term, say, a1, a2, up to a9, where a9 is the innermost one. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(a1), and so on. Let me try that approach. Let's start by computing the innermost part first. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost term, let's call it a1, is 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(a1). Since a1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, a2 is 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(a2). Since a2 is 13, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, a3 is 40. Continuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*a3. a3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, a4 is 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*a4. a4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, a5 is 364. Next: 1 + 3*a5. a5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, a6 is 1093. Then, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*a6. a6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, a7 is 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*a7. a7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, a8 is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*a8. a8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 times 3. Let me do that step by step. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, a9 is 29524. Now, remember that the entire original expression is 3 times this outermost layer, which is a9. So, the entire expression is 3*a9. Since a9 is 29524, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Each step seems to follow logically, and I didn't see any calculation errors when I went through each step. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Maybe I can compute this by starting from the innermost part and moving outward. Let me start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems simple enough. Let me compute that first. So, innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me compute that step by step. Let me number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9. So, layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so total is 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding up: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that multiplication again because 3*29524 should be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit. Let's see: 29524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me verify if I did each step correctly because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake in such a long process.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Yes, that's correct. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3.\n\nLet me do it another way: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time we're adding 1 and tripling the previous value. So, it's a geometric progression? Let me see. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can compute each term step by step as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's see. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, how many layers do we have? Let me recount. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer. So, let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections. From the innermost, there are 9 such sections, right? Because each time we have a (1 + 3(...)) until we get to the outermost one. So, if we have 9 layers, then n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. Therefore, using the formula, I can confirm that the result is 88572. So, even though the step-by-step computation was tedious, it's correct because it aligns with the formula derived from the recurrence relation.

    "text": " Maybe I can define each layer as a function or a variable. Let me try to define each level starting from the innermost one. Let's denote each innermost expression as a variable, maybe starting from the inside. Let me see, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(innermost). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and so on. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that. Let me start by labeling each layer. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \n... and so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is multiplied by 3 after the innermost part. Hmm, maybe I should consider each step as computing the innermost parentheses first, then substituting back into the next layer, and so on.\n\nLet me try to compute each step one by one, starting from the innermost parentheses. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost Layer (Layer 1):  \n1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that would be:\n\nLayer 2:  \n1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out is again 1 + 3*(Layer 2):\n\nLayer 3:  \n1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nContinuing this way, Layer 4 would be:\n\nLayer 4:  \n1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5:  \n1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6:  \n1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7:  \n1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8:  \n1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9:  \n1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), but the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFinal Result:  \n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nHmm, let me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000  \nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000  \n500 * 3 = 1500  \n20 * 3 = 60  \n4 * 3 = 12  \nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 60 = 88560  \n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 again step by step:\n\n29524  \n*         3  \n__________  \nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.  \n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.  \n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.  \nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's break down 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000  \n9000 * 3 = 27000  \n500 * 3 = 1500  \n20 * 3 = 60  \n4 * 3 = 12  \nNow, adding these up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 60 = 88560  \n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSame result. Okay, that seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach, like recognizing a pattern or formula. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, this seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled recursively.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, we can model this as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C  \nC - 3C = 1  \n-2C = 1  \nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4  \nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is essentially building a geometric series. Since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), and the previous term is also built in the same way, it's like a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nBut in this case, since each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous, it's not a simple geometric series, but the recursive formula can be solved as I did above.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about it as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nIf I consider that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this expansion, after k steps, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{k} + 3^{k+1}*a_{n - k -1}.\n\nIf we go all the way to the base case, a_1 = 4, then a_n would be the sum from i=0 to n-1 of 3^i plus 3^n * a_1. Wait, but a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3, so maybe this approach isn't directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{k} = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's similar to what we had before. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, which is correct.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it, by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series and using the formula.\n\nBut regardless of the approach, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the result is the same.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without using the formula, just to verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYep, same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps, checked my work using different methods, and everything lines up. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I can define this recursively. Let me think: Let's say I have a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 3(1 + f(n-1)). So, f(n) is 3 times (1 plus f(n-1)). That seems right. Now, since there are nine layers, I can compute f(9). But to do that, I need to know f(8), which depends on f(7), and so on, down to f(0). What would f(0) be? If there are no layers, then f(0) would just be 1, right? Because it's the innermost part, which is 1. Let me test that idea. If n=0, f(0)=1. Then, f(1)=3(1 + f(0))=3(1 + 1)=3*2=6. Then, f(2)=3(1 + f(1))=3(1 + 6)=3*7=21. Hmm, that seems to be working. Let me go further. f(3)=3(1 + f(2))=3(1 +21)=3*22=66. f(4)=3(1 + f(3))=3(1 +66)=3*67=201. f(5)=3(1 + f(4))=3(1 +201)=3*202=606. f(6)=3(1 + f(5))=3(1 +606)=3*607=1821. f(7)=3(1 + f(6))=3(1 +1821)=3*1822=5466. f(8)=3(1 + f(7))=3(1 +5466)=3*5467=16401. Finally, f(9)=3(1 + f(8))=3(1 +16401)=3*16402=49206. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations because that's a big number, and I might have made a mistake in multiplying. Let me go through each step again to make sure.\n\nStarting with f(0)=1.\n\nf(1)=3*(1 + f(0))=3*(1 +1)=3*2=6. Correct.\n\nf(2)=3*(1 +6)=3*7=21. Correct.\n\nf(3)=3*(1 +21)=3*22=66. Correct.\n\nf(4)=3*(1 +66)=3*67=201. Correct.\n\nf(5)=3*(1 +201)=3*202=606. Correct.\n\nf(6)=3*(1 +606)=3*607=1821. Let me compute 607*3: 600*3=1800, 7*3=21, so 1800+21=1821. Correct.\n\nf(7)=3*(1 +1821)=3*1822. Let's compute 1822*3: 1800*3=5400, 22*3=66, so 5400+66=5466. Correct.\n\nf(8)=3*(1 +5466)=3*5467. Compute 5467*3: 5000*3=15000, 400*3=1200, 60*3=180, 7*3=21. So, adding them up: 15000+1200=16200, 16200+180=16380, 16380+21=16401. Correct.\n\nf(9)=3*(1 +16401)=3*16402. Let's compute 16402*3: 10000*3=30000, 6000*3=18000, 400*3=1200, 2*3=6. Wait, but 16402 is 10000 + 6000 + 400 + 2. So, 30000 + 18000=48000, 48000 + 1200=49200, 49200 +6=49206. So, yes, 16402*3=49206. Therefore, f(9)=49206. So, the value of the original expression is 49,206. Hmm, but wait, let me see if I can find another way to compute this without recursion. Maybe by expanding the expression step by step manually. Let me try that approach to verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nThe innermost expression is 1 + 3. So, that's 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). 3*4=12, so 1 +12=13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13). 3*13=39, so 1 +39=40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40=120, so 1 +120=121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121=363, so 1 +363=364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364=1092, so 1 +1092=1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093). 3*1093=3279, so 1 +3279=3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280). 3*3280=9840, so 1 +9840=9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841). 3*9841=29523, so 1 +29523=29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524)=88572. Wait, that's different from the previous result. Hmm, so now I'm confused because using the recursive approach I got 49,206, but expanding step by step, I got 88,572. There must be a mistake somewhere. Let me check my step-by-step expansion again because maybe I miscounted the layers or messed up the multiplication.\n\nWait, let's count how many layers we're expanding. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first innermost. Then each time we go outward, we add another layer. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) =13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13)=40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40)=121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121)=364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364)=1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093)=3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280)=9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841)=29524\n\n10. 3*(29524)=88572\n\nWait, so in my first approach, I thought there were nine layers, but when expanding, I did 10 steps, meaning 10 layers? Wait, no, the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, in total, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, each time adding a new 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, perhaps the expansion should have 9 layers, and then the final multiplication by 3. Let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(4) =13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13)=40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40)=121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121)=364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364)=1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093)=3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280)=9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841)=29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, so according to this, the total number of layers inside is 9, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 is the 10th step. But in my recursive approach earlier, I considered f(9) as the outermost, which would correspond to the 9th layer inside. So, perhaps my initial recursive approach was wrong because I considered f(9) as the outermost, but actually, the outermost is f(9) multiplied by 3. Wait, no, in the recursive approach, I defined f(n) as 3*(1 + f(n-1)), so f(9) would already include that outermost 3. Let me check:\n\nIf n=0, f(0)=1.\n\nf(1)=3*(1 +1)=6.\n\nf(2)=3*(1 +6)=21.\n\nf(3)=3*(1 +21)=66.\n\nf(4)=3*(1 +66)=201.\n\nf(5)=3*(1 +201)=606.\n\nf(6)=3*(1 +606)=1821.\n\nf(7)=3*(1 +1821)=5466.\n\nf(8)=3*(1 +5466)=16401.\n\nf(9)=3*(1 +16401)=49206.\n\nSo, according to this, f(9)=49206, which would correspond to the outermost expression, which is 3*(1 + f(8))=3*(1 +16401)=49206.\n\nBut in the step-by-step expansion, I ended up with 88572. There's a discrepancy here. So, which one is correct? Let me check the step-by-step again.\n\nWait, in the step-by-step, I had 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous), and then the outermost 3*(result). But in the recursive approach, f(n) already includes the 3*(1 + ...), so f(9) is the outermost. So, in the step-by-step, I think I miscounted. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) =4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4)=13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13)=40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40)=121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121)=364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364)=1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093)=3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280)=9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841)=29524\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in the recursive approach, f(9)=49206, which is 3*(1 + f(8))=3*(1 +16401)=49206.\n\nSo, the difference is that in the step-by-step, I went through 9 layers inside, then multiplied by 3, whereas in the recursive approach, f(9) already includes that outermost multiplication. Therefore, perhaps the step-by-step approach is correct because it directly follows the structure of the original expression, while the recursive approach might have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so the innermost is 1+3, then each next layer is 1 +3*(...), and finally, the outermost is 3*(...). So, in terms of layers, the innermost is layer 1: 1 +3.\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*(layer1).\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(layer2).\n\n...\n\nLayer9:1 +3*(layer8).\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(layer9).\n\nSo, in terms of f(n), if f(n)=1 +3*f(n-1), with f(1)=1+3=4, then f(9)=1 +3*f(8). But in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(f(9)). So, perhaps the recursive approach should have f(n)=3*(1 + f(n-1)), making f(9) the outermost. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me redefine f(n) as the value of the expression starting from the nth layer. So, if the innermost is layer1: 1 +3, then layer2:1 +3*(layer1), and so on, up to layer9:1 +3*(layer8). Then, the outermost is 3*(layer9). So, in this case, f(n)=1 +3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThen, f(2)=1 +3*4=13.\n\nf(3)=1 +3*13=40.\n\nf(4)=1 +3*40=121.\n\nf(5)=1 +3*121=364.\n\nf(6)=1 +3*364=1093.\n\nf(7)=1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nf(8)=1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nf(9)=1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, in this case, the correct answer is 88,572. So, why did the recursive approach earlier give me 49,206? Because I defined f(n)=3*(1 + f(n-1)), starting from f(0)=1. But in reality, the innermost layer is 1 +3, which is 4, so f(1)=4, not 1. Therefore, my initial definition was wrong. I should have defined f(1)=4, and then f(n)=1 +3*f(n-1). Then, f(9)=29524, and the outermost is 3*f(9)=88572.\n\nSo, to correct the recursive approach:\n\nLet f(1)=1 +3=4.\n\nf(2)=1 +3*f(1)=1 +3*4=13.\n\nf(3)=1 +3*f(2)=1 +3*13=40.\n\nf(4)=1 +3*f(3)=1 +3*40=121.\n\nf(5)=1 +3*f(4)=1 +3*121=364.\n\nf(6)=1 +3*f(5)=1 +3*364=1093.\n\nf(7)=1 +3*f(6)=1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nf(8)=1 +3*f(7)=1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nf(9)=1 +3*f(8)=1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong in the initial recursive approach? I think I misdefined f(n). I started with f(0)=1, which corresponds to the innermost 1, but in reality, the innermost operation is 1 +3, which is 4, so f(1)=4, not f(0)=1. Therefore, my initial approach was incorrect because I didn't align the function properly with the layers.\n\nSo, to summarize, the correct way is to define f(1)=4, then each subsequent layer is f(n)=1 +3*f(n-1), leading up to f(9)=29524, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result: 88,572.\n\nLet me verify this another way. Maybe by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series or something similar. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the recursive formula f(n)=1 +3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n)=A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: f_h(n)=A*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution f_p(n)=C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC =1 +3*C.\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n)=A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, f(1)=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 +1/2=3A => 9/2=3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is f(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nf(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9,\n\nf(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049.\n\nSo,\n\nf(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I initially made a mistake by misdefining the recursive function, but after correcting it, both the step-by-step expansion and the recursive formula with the proper initial condition lead to the same result. Additionally, solving the recurrence relation gave me the same answer, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each innermost expression first and then build my way out. Let me try to number these parentheses from the innermost to the outermost to keep track. Let's see: The innermost part is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, let me compute each step by step. Let me define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s denote each innermost expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost and E9 is the outermost. So, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4. E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9. Wait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(E1), but actually, no, let me check again. Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving outward each time. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me start by labeling each layer:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, but let me check the original problem again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, if I count the number of opening parentheses, it's 9, each corresponding to a 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I think the correct approach is to compute each layer from the innermost outward, each time substituting the inner expression with its computed value. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let me do this multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000, but wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute 3*29524 directly.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524*3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here that could have been recognized earlier, so that I don't have to compute each layer manually? Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at each layer, each time we have E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E_1 = 4.\n\nSo, E_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved more generally. The general form is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nAlternatively, since each term is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, we can write it as E_n + c = 3*(E_{n-1} + c), to find a constant c that makes it a geometric sequence.\n\nLet me try that. Let's assume E_n + c = 3*(E_{n-1} + c). Then,\n\nE_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 3c - c = 3*E_{n-1} + 2c.\n\nBut from the original recurrence, E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. So, 3*E_{n-1} + 2c = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, which implies 2c = 1, so c = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, E_n + 1/2 = 3*(E_{n-1} + 1/2). So, the sequence E_n + 1/2 is a geometric sequence with ratio 3.\n\nGiven E_1 = 4, then E_1 + 1/2 = 4.5 = 9/2.\n\nThus, E_n + 1/2 = (9/2)*3^{n-1}.\n\nTherefore, E_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, E_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut wait, let me check this formula with n=1:\n\nE_1 = (9*3^{0} -1)/2 = (9*1 -1)/2 = (8)/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: E_2 = (9*3^{1} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (9*9 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nSo, for n=9, E_9 = (9*3^{8} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, E_9 = (9*6561 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since E_n = (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2, then 3*E_n = 3*(9*3^{n-1} -1)/2 = (27*3^{n-1} -3)/2.\n\nBut for n=9, that would be (27*3^{8} -3)/2 = (27*6561 -3)/2.\n\n27*6561: Let's compute that.\n\n6561 * 27:\n\nFirst, 6561 * 20 = 131220\n\n6561 *7=45927\n\nAdding them together: 131220 + 45927 = 177147\n\nThen, 177147 -3 =177144\n\nDivide by 2: 177144 /2 =88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's consistent with our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, and the formula approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let me represent each nested expression as follows:\n\nLet me define each nested term as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nTerm1 = 1 + 3\n\nTerm2 = 1 + 3*(Term1)\n\nTerm3 = 1 + 3*(Term2)\n\n...\n\nTerm9 = 1 + 3*(Term8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Term9).\n\nWait, so in my earlier calculation, I computed Term1 through Term9 correctly, and then multiplied Term9 by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*...). So, when I compute Term1, it's 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, Term2 is 3*(1 + 3*Term1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39? Wait, no, that's not right because in the problem, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*...), so perhaps I have to adjust my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the structure. Let me try again.\n\nLet me think of each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define each nested expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost, and E9 is the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost is 3*(...), so maybe E1 is the innermost (1 + 3), then E2 is 1 + 3*E1, and so on, up to E9, and then the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, that's what I did earlier, which gave me 88,572. But let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider each layer as 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so let me think of each step as 3*(1 + 3*previous_step). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Wait, this is different from my earlier approach. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the structure earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, then moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous_innermost).\n\nSo, let's try this approach again:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 3*Layer1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*Layer2) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 3*Layer3) = 3*(1 + 1,062) = 3*1,063 = 3,189\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 3*Layer4) = 3*(1 + 9,567) = 3*9,568 = 28,704\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 3*Layer5) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 3*Layer6) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 3*Layer7) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 3*Layer8) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404\n\nWait, but this gives a completely different result. So, which approach is correct?\n\nWait, I think I confused myself earlier. Let me try to structure it correctly. The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*...). Therefore, starting from the innermost, each step is 3*(1 + 3*previous_innermost). So, let's model it correctly.\n\nLet me list each layer step by step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 3*Layer1) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*Layer2) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 3*Layer3) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1,062) = 3*1,063 = 3,189\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 3*Layer4) = 3*(1 + 3*3,189) = 3*(1 + 9,567) = 3*9,568 = 28,704\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 3*Layer5) = 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 3*Layer6) = 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 3*Layer7) = 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 3*Layer8) = 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404\n\nThen, the entire expression is Layer9, which is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but this is way larger than my previous result of 88,572. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, there are nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, that means there are nine layers, each being 3*(1 + 3*...). Therefore, the correct approach is to compute each layer as 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer), starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let's recompute each layer correctly:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 3*Layer1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*Layer2) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 3*Layer3) = 3*(1 + 1,062) = 3*1,063 = 3,189\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 3*Layer4) = 3*(1 + 9,567) = 3*9,568 = 28,704\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 3*Layer5) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 3*Layer6) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 3*Layer7) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 3*Layer8) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404\n\nTherefore, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but this seems inconsistent with my earlier result. So, where did I go wrong before?\n\nIn my first approach, I considered each layer as 1 + 3*previous_layer, without the initial 3* multiplier, which led to a much smaller result. But in reality, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer), so the initial approach was incorrect. Therefore, the correct result should be 188,329,404.\n\nWait, let me confirm this by recalculating each layer step by step to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1,062) = 3*1,063 = 3,189\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 3*3,189) = 3*(1 + 9,567) = 3*9,568 = 28,704\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1 appropriately. So, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nBut wait, let me check the arithmetic for each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1,062) = 3*1,063 = 3,189. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 3*3,189) = 3*(1 + 9,567) = 3*9,568 = 28,704. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 188,329,404.\n\nWait a second, but in my initial approach, I treated each layer as 1 + 3*previous_layer without the initial 3*, which gave me a much smaller number. But upon re-examining the problem, I realized that each layer is indeed 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer), so my second approach is the correct one.\n\nSo, the final answer is 188,329,404.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\n1. **Innermost layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 4) = 3 \\times (1 + 12) = 3 \\times 13 = 39\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 39) = 3 \\times (1 + 117) = 3 \\times 118 = 354\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 354) = 3 \\times (1 + 1062) = 3 \\times 1063 = 3189\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 3189) = 3 \\times (1 + 9567) = 3 \\times 9568 = 28704\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 28704) = 3 \\times (1 + 86112) = 3 \\times 86113 = 258339\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 258339) = 3 \\times (1 + 775017) = 3 \\times 775018 = 2325054\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 2325054) = 3 \\times (1 + 6975162) = 3 \\times 6975163 = 20925489\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 20925489) = 3 \\times (1 + 62776467) = 3 \\times 62776468 = 188329404\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{188329404}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe if I start evaluating from the innermost part, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) Now, moving one layer out, the next innermost expression is (1 + 3(4)). Let me compute that. So, 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 equals 13. So, now the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))))) Next layer out: (1 + 3(13)). Let's compute that. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40))))))) Moving outward again, the next layer is (1 + 3(40)). 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So now, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121)))))) Next, compute (1 + 3(121)). 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364)))))) Now, moving outward, compute (1 + 3(364)). 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, the expression is now: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093)))) Next, compute (1 + 3(1093)). 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, now the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280))) Moving outward again, compute (1 + 3(3280)). 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(9841)) Next, compute (1 + 3(9841)). 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, now the expression is: 3(29524) Finally, compute 3 times 29524. Let me do that multiplication. 3 times 29524. Hmm, let's break it down: 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 20 is 60, and 3 times 4 is 12. Wait, no, that's not the right way because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. But actually, it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3. 4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. So, reading it from top to bottom, it's 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3\u00d74) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. (1 + 3\u00d713) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. (1 + 3\u00d740) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. (1 + 3\u00d7121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. (1 + 3\u00d7364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. (1 + 3\u00d71093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. (1 + 3\u00d73280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. (1 + 3\u00d79841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\nEach step seems correct. I don't see any arithmetic errors in my calculations. So, I think the final answer is 88572. I wonder if there's a quicker way to compute this without expanding each layer, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think about that for a second. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3\u00d7(previous result). So, it's like a recursive sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3\u00d7a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3\u00d7a_9. So, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. First, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A\u00d73^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3a_p = 1 => -2a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A\u00d73^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A\u00d73^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when expanding step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3\u00d7a_9 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method, I also get the same result. That's good. It seems like both methods lead to the same answer, so I can be confident that 88572 is correct. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both approaches\u2014direct computation and solving the recurrence\u2014give the same result. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me label them from the innermost to the outermost. Let me call the innermost part as A, then the next one as B, and so on, up to I, which would be the outermost. But wait, maybe that's overcomplicating it. Alternatively, I can think of each layer as a function of the next one. Let me try that approach. Let me define each layer starting from the innermost. So, starting from the innermost expression: Let me denote the innermost part as E9, then the next one as E8, and so on, up to E0, which would be the entire expression. So, E9 = 1 + 3. Then E8 = 1 + 3*E9, E7 = 1 + 3*E8, and so on, until E0 = 3*E1. Hmm, that might be a good way to structure it. Let me try that. So, first, E9 is the innermost: E9 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, E8 = 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, E8 is 13. Next, E7 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, E7 is 40. Moving on, E6 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. E6 is 121. Next, E5 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. E5 is 364. Then, E4 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. E4 is 1093. Next, E3 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. E3 is 3280. Moving on, E2 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. E2 is 9841. Next, E1 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. E1 is 29524. Finally, the entire expression E0 = 3*E1 = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let me break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, E0 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when doing a lot of multiplication, it's easy to slip up. Let me go through each step again. Starting with E9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. E8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. E7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. E6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. E5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. E4: 1 + 3*364. 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. E3: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. E2: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. E1: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841 again. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, E0 = 3*29524. Let me compute 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to confirm that my answer is correct. Another way to approach nested expressions like this is to recognize a pattern or even a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the values I calculated earlier. Let me list out the E values again:\n\nE9 = 4\n\nE8 = 13\n\nE7 = 40\n\nE6 = 121\n\nE5 = 364\n\nE4 = 1093\n\nE3 = 3280\n\nE2 = 9841\n\nE1 = 29524\n\nE0 = 88572\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}. So, each term is defined based on the next term. Let me see if I can find a general formula for E_n. Let's consider that each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}. This is a recurrence relation. If I can solve this recurrence relation, I can find a direct formula for E_n without computing each term step by step. Let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}, for n = 9,8,...,0.\n\nWait, actually, since we start from E9 and go to E0, it's more like E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, but no, actually, in our case, each E_n is defined in terms of E_{n+1}, so it's a bit different.\n\nWait, maybe I can write it as E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1} for n from 9 down to 0.\n\nBut let me think about this. Let's consider that E0 is the outermost expression, which is 3*E1, and E1 is 1 + 3*E2, and so on, until E9 = 1 + 3*E10, but wait, actually, in our case, E9 is the innermost, so E9 = 1 + 3, and E8 = 1 + 3*E9, etc., up to E0 = 3*E1.\n\nSo, actually, the recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1} for n = 9,8,...,1, and E0 = 3*E1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index it from n=0 to n=9, where E0 is the innermost. Let me try that.\n\nLet me redefine: Let E0 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*E0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, but in our original problem, the outermost expression is 3*E1, not E9. So, perhaps my indexing is a bit off.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is E1 = 4, then E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 13, and so on, up to E9 = 88573, but then the entire expression is 3*E1, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, in this case, E1 is 29524, which is the value before the outermost 3 multiplier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, starting from E1 = 4, E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Let me write it as E_{n} = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = E_n^{(h)} + E_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, E1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our case, we have n going from 1 to 9, since E1 = 4, E2 = 13, etc., up to E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n=1, E1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So, yes, this formula works.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, E9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but in our earlier step-by-step computation, E9 was 29524, which matches. So, E9 = 29524.\n\nBut in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*E1, where E1 = 29524. So, 3*29524 = 88572, which is our final answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and in our case, the outermost expression is 3*E1, where E1 corresponds to n=1. So, E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = 4, as before.\n\nBut in the problem, the entire expression is 3*E1, where E1 is defined as 1 + 3*E2, and so on. So, using the formula, E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = 4, E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 13, and so on.\n\nBut perhaps I can find a direct formula for the entire expression. Let me think.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine sets of parentheses. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*... So, perhaps the entire expression can be written as 3*(E1), where E1 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9 = 1 + 3*E10, but since E10 is undefined, actually, E9 is the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers. Wait, in our earlier calculation, E1 = 4, which is (3^2 -1)/2 = 4. E2 = 13 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 13. So, if we have k layers, the value would be (3^{k+1} -1)/2. But in our problem, how many layers are there? Let's see.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, then 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on.\n\nLet me count them: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but in our earlier calculation, E9 was 29524, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. So, if we have 9 layers, the value is (3^{10} -1)/2. So, the entire expression is 3*(E1), where E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = 4. So, 3*4 = 12. Wait, that can't be right because when I computed step by step, I got 88572. So, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, so the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, meaning that the innermost is E1, then E2, up to E9, which is the value before the outermost 3.\n\nWait, in our earlier step-by-step, E9 was 29524, which was the value before the outermost 3, so the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut according to the formula, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers. So, if we have 9 layers, then E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, which matches. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if we think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, then the value is 3*E9, where E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it directly using the formula.\n\nSo, that confirms that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Correct. So, 3^{11} -3 = 177147 -3 = 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(...). By evaluating from the innermost layer outward, each layer's value can be computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern, we can use the formula for the nth term of the sequence defined by the recurrence relation, leading to the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Start with the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n   - Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer's value).\n\n3. **Calculate each layer's value**:\n   - Layer 1: 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me denote the innermost expression as Layer 1, then Layer 2, all the way up to Layer 9.

Then, moving outwards, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that approach.

Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate a step.\n\nStarting again with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each layer is just multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a geometric progression, but since each term is built upon the previous, it's more like a recursive sequence. But since it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. If it were more layers, I might look for a pattern or a formula, but for 9 layers, step-by-step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I did earlier. So, computing up to a_9 and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each innermost expression first and then build my way up. Let me start from the very inside. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Then, the next layer out is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so now that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3*(previous result). So that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer becomes 40. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me see if this pattern continues. The next layer out would be 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that's 121. Next, the layer would be 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate that: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, that's 364. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 is 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, now we're at 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let's see: 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that's 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that's 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that's 88573. Now, remember, each of these layers was inside another 3 times the result. So, the outermost part of the original expression is 3*(this result). So, we have 3*88573. Let me compute that. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265719. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. It's easy to make an error when dealing with such large numbers. Let me go through each step again quickly. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally, 3*88573 = 265719\n\nHmm, each step seems correct. I don't see any arithmetic errors upon reviewing. So, I think the final result is indeed 265719. It's interesting how each layer builds up exponentially. Each time, multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which leads to rapid growth in the numbers. It's a good example of how nested operations can quickly escalate in value. I was a bit worried about keeping track of all the layers, but by tackling them one at a time from the inside out, it became manageable. I guess the key here was recognizing the pattern and systematically working through each layer without getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the entire expression at once. It's a good reminder that even the most intimidating-looking problems can often be broken down into simpler, more digestible parts.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{265719}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue substituting and computing each layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 \\]\n\n4. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n   \\[ 3 \\times 88573 = 265719 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{265719}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I can compute this by starting from the innermost part and moving outward. Let me try to parse it step by step. Let's define each layer from the inside out. Let me label them as Layer 1, Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do this step by step. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, that seems like a big number, but considering there are nine layers of multiplication by 3, it might add up. Let me just verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. I think that's right. It was a bit tedious with all the layers, but by breaking it down step by step, it became manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Maybe I can start by evaluating the innermost part first and then build my way out. Let's start by identifying the innermost parentheses. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3), right? Because each time, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, and then each layer wraps around that. So, let's compute that first: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, this layer becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So now, this layer evaluates to 13. Next, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). The previous result was 13, so this becomes 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, this layer is 40. Let me write down each step as I go along to keep track:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that gives the next layer. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of these calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each step checks out. Now, after computing all the innermost layers, we end up with the innermost expression evaluating to 29524. But wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times ...))). So, when I computed up to 29524, that was the result of the innermost parentheses, which is the ninth layer. But then, the entire expression is 3 times that result, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, I think I might have missed that last step.\n\nWait, let's recount the layers. Each time I compute a layer, I'm moving outward. So, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3) =4. Then layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. So, layer 9 is the result of the innermost nine layers. But then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, after computing layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I stopped at 29524, thinking that was the final result, but actually, I need to multiply that by 3. Hmm, that's a crucial point. So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, after computing all nine layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, I need to compute 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times ...)). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, after nine layers, the innermost is layer 9, and then we have the outermost 3*(...). So, yes, after computing layer 9 as 29524, we have to multiply by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again. It says:\n\nCompute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is the innermost.\n\nThen, moving out, each \"1+3(...)\" is a new layer. So, let's count the number of times we have \"1+3(...)\":\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to how many? Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end. The original expression ends with ))))))))\u2014nine closing parentheses. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to an opening one. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another closing parenthesis. Therefore, there are nine layers of \"1+3(...)\", each adding another closing parenthesis.\n\nTherefore, after computing the innermost nine layers, we have 29524, and then the outermost 3*(...) gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about that.\n\nLet's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich is exactly what I computed earlier. So, the ninth term is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, this recursive relation can be solved as a linear recurrence. Let's see:\n\nWe have a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it, we arrive at the same result, which confirms that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the structure of the expression, it's similar to repeatedly applying the function f(x) = 3x + 1, starting from x=1, and doing this nine times, and then multiplying the result by 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me clarify: Each layer is f(x) = 1 + 3x, starting from x=1, and applying this function nine times, then multiplying the result by 3.\n\nBut regardless, the result is the same.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you have a term like 1 + 3*(...), it's equivalent to 3*(previous term) + 1. So, it's a linear function each time.\n\nGiven that, the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 - 1 = 59048\n\nDivide by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). After computing each layer, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Finally, we multiply this result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Start with the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the result of the innermost layer by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me think of it as a sequence of operations. Maybe if I start from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), and work my way out, each step will involve multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me try that. Let's define each step as a term where I compute the innermost expression first. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the number of layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, until a_9, which would be the entire expression inside the outermost 3(...). Then, the final result would be 3*a_9. Hmm, that might be a good approach. Let me try writing down each a_n step by step. Let's start:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. Since a_1 is 4, that's 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. If a_2 = 1 + 3*(a_1), which is 1 + 3*4, that is indeed 1 + 12, which is 13. Correct.\n\nMoving on, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. So, 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, plus 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, a_3 = 40.\n\nNext, a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3. a_3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, a_4 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4. 3*121. Hmm, let's compute that. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So, 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, a_5 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5. 3*364. Let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, a_6 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6. 3*1093. Let me calculate that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, a_7 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7. 3*3280. Let's see: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, a_8 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8. 3*9841. Hmm, that's a bigger number. Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(a_9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that multiplication because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in breaking it down. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yeah, that matches. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing a_9. Because if a_8 was 9841, then 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me recount the steps:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent each time. Each step builds upon the previous one without any discrepancies. So, I think the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let's see.\n\nEach a_n is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general form of a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} can be solved using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The solution typically has a homogeneous and particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 1\n\n-2*C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3*A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*A\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3*A\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each n, a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\na_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our case, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we found earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nWhich matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to compute each step manually. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since in this problem, there are 9 layers (from a_1 to a_9), computing each step manually is manageable, but it's easy to see how the formula approach would save time for more layers.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, we can find a closed-form solution, which allows us to compute the result without manually calculating each intermediate step. This not only saves time but also reduces the chance of errors.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each term is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next term. By recognizing this pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to solve it efficiently. The solution involves computing each layer step by step or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. Both methods lead to the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). There are nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Define Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value of the nth layer.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me try to number each layer for clarity. Let's denote each inner expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E9 is the innermost one. So, E9 = 1 + 3. Then E8 = 1 + 3*E9, E7 = 1 + 3*E8, and so on, until E1 = 1 + 3*E2, and the entire expression is 3*E1. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(E1), where E1 is 1 + 3*E2, E2 is 1 + 3*E3, etc., up to E9. So, E9 is the innermost, and E1 is the outermost. So, starting from E9, let's compute each E step by step. Let me write this down:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E1, so:\n\n3*E1 = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me do the multiplication step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did all the E steps correctly because that's a lot of steps, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each E again.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 (correct)\n\nE7=1 +3*13=1+39=40 (correct)\n\nE6=1 +3*40=1 +120=121 (correct)\n\nE5=1 +3*121=1 +363=364 (correct)\n\nE4=1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 (correct)\n\nE3=1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 (correct)\n\nE2=1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 (correct)\n\nE1=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 (correct)\n\nThen 3*29524=88572 (correct)\n\nHmm, seems correct. But let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each E is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}, starting from E9=4. So, each time, E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}. Let me see if I can find a general formula for E_n in terms of E_{n+1}. Wait, but that might not be necessary since I've already computed each step, and the result seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. If I expand the expression, each term would be 3^k multiplied by 1, for k from 1 to 9, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me try expanding the expression step by step.\n\nWait, another way: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, if I let x = the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(1 + 3*next layer). But I think the way I did it before, computing each E from E9 to E1, is correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I can write this as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to see. If I have E9 = 1 + 3, which is 4. E8 = 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. E7 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 39 =40. Hmm, each E is 1 + 3*previous E. So, starting from E9=4, E8=13, E7=40, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define E_n where n starts from 9. So E9=4, E8=13, E7=40, and so on. The recurrence is E_{n} = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}. So, starting from E9=4, each previous E is 1 + 3 times the next E.\n\nSo, E8 = 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nE7=1 + 3*E8=1 +3*13=40\n\nE6=1 +3*40=121\n\nE5=1 +3*121=364\n\nE4=1 +3*364=1093\n\nE3=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nE2=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nE1=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen the total is 3*E1=3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E_n. Let me think about it. Since each E_n =1 + 3*E_{n+1}, and this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a first-order linear recurrence, it might be manageable.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}, which can be rewritten as E_{n+1} = (E_n -1)/3.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to express it as E_{n} =1 + 3*E_{n+1}, so we can write E_{n} -3*E_{n+1}=1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found as a constant. Let me assume a particular solution E_n^{(p)}=A. Substituting into the equation:\n\nA -3*A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is E_n = E_n^{(h)} + E_n^{(p)} = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Wait, but in our case, E9=4. So when n=9, E9=4= C*3^9 -1/2.\n\nSo, 4 + 1/2 = C*3^9 => 9/2 = C*19683 => C= (9/2)/19683= 9/(2*19683)= 3/(2*6561)= 3/(13122)= 1/4374.\n\nSo the general solution is E_n= (1/4374)*3^n -1/2.\n\nWait, let me check this with n=9.\n\nE9= (1/4374)*3^9 -1/2= (19683)/4374 -1/2.\n\nCompute 19683 divided by 4374: 4374*4=17496, 4374*4.5=17496 +2187=19683. So 19683/4374=4.5.\n\nSo E9=4.5 -0.5=4, which matches. Good.\n\nSimilarly, for n=8, E8= (1/4374)*3^8 -1/2= (6561)/4374 -0.5.\n\nCompute 6561/4374: 4374*1.5=6561, so 6561/4374=1.5.\n\nThus, E8=1.5 -0.5=1, but wait, that's not correct because earlier we found E8=13. Hmm, that's a problem. So my approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the direction of the recurrence. Because in the recurrence, E_n=1 +3*E_{n+1}, so when n increases, the term depends on the next term. So perhaps the general solution should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the recurrence in the opposite direction. Let me try to model E_{n} in terms of E_{n-1}. Wait, but in our case, E_n=1 +3*E_{n+1}, so it's a forward recurrence. Maybe it's better to reverse the indices.\n\nLet me define m=9-n, so that when n=9, m=0, and when n=8, m=1, etc. So E_n= E_{9 - m}.\n\nThen the recurrence becomes E_{9 - m} =1 +3*E_{9 - (m-1)} =1 +3*E_{10 - m}.\n\nWait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the recurrence in terms of m= n-9, so m=0 when n=9, m=1 when n=8, etc. So E_{n}= E_{9 - m}.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from n=9 and moving backward. So the general solution I found earlier gives E_n= C*3^n -1/2, but when I plug in n=9, it works, but when I plug in n=8, it doesn't. So maybe my approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the recurrence in reverse. Let me define F_m = E_{9 - m}, so that F_0 = E9=4, F1=E8=13, F2=E7=40, etc.\n\nThen the recurrence becomes F_{m} =1 +3*F_{m+1}, for m >=0.\n\nSo, F0=4, F1=13, F2=40, etc.\n\nNow, let's model this recurrence. The recurrence is F_{m} =1 +3*F_{m+1}, which can be rewritten as F_{m+1} = (F_{m} -1)/3.\n\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is F^{(h)}_{m} = C*(1/3)^m.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (-1/3), we can assume a particular solution F^{(p)}_{m} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA =1 +3*A => A =1 +3A => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is F_{m}= C*(1/3)^m -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition F0=4.\n\nSo, 4= C*(1/3)^0 -1/2 => 4= C*1 -1/2 => C=4 +1/2=9/2.\n\nThus, F_{m}= (9/2)*(1/3)^m -1/2.\n\nNow, we can compute F9, which corresponds to E0, but wait, in our original problem, we have E1, which is F8, because m=8.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nF0=E9\n\nF1=E8\n\nF2=E7\n\n...\n\nF8=E1\n\nSo, to find E1, which is F8, we can plug m=8 into the formula.\n\nF8= (9/2)*(1/3)^8 -1/2.\n\nCompute (1/3)^8=1/6561.\n\nSo F8= (9/2)*(1/6561) -1/2= (9)/(2*6561) -1/2= (9)/(13122) -1/2.\n\nSimplify 9/13122: 9 divides by 9, so 1/1458.\n\nSo F8=1/1458 -1/2= (1 - 729)/1458= (-728)/1458= -364/729.\n\nWait, that can't be right because E1 was 29524, which is positive, so F8=E1=29524, but according to this formula, it's negative, which is a contradiction. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the recurrence. Let me check again.\n\nWe have F_{m} =1 +3*F_{m+1}, so the recurrence is F_{m+1}=(F_{m}-1)/3.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is F^{(h)}_{m}=C*(1/3)^m.\n\nThe particular solution is F^{(p)}_{m}=A.\n\nSubstituting into F_{m}=1 +3*F_{m+1}:\n\nA=1 +3*A => -2A=1 => A=-1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is F_{m}=C*(1/3)^m -1/2.\n\nApplying F0=4:\n\n4= C*(1/3)^0 -1/2 => 4= C -1/2 => C=4 +1/2=9/2.\n\nSo F_{m}= (9/2)*(1/3)^m -1/2.\n\nNow, for m=8, F8= (9/2)*(1/3)^8 -1/2= (9/2)*(1/6561) -1/2= (9)/(13122) -1/2= (1)/(1458) -1/2.\n\nWhich is indeed negative, but in our earlier computation, F8=E1=29524, which is positive. So there's a contradiction, meaning I must have made a mistake in setting up the recurrence or the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the direction of the recurrence wrong. Let me think again.\n\nIn our original problem, E_n=1 +3*E_{n+1}, where n starts at 9 and goes down to 1.\n\nBut when I defined F_{m}=E_{9 -m}, then F0=E9, F1=E8, etc., up to F8=E1.\n\nBut the recurrence in terms of F is F_{m}=1 +3*F_{m+1}, so F0=1 +3*F1.\n\nWait, but in our case, F0=E9=4, F1=E8=13, so 4=1 +3*13=1 +39=40, which is not correct because 4\u226040. So that can't be right. Therefore, my definition of F_{m} must be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have defined F_{m}=E_{n}, where n=9 -m, but that might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model the recurrence as E_{n}=1 +3*E_{n+1}, starting from E9=4, and going up to E1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to reverse the indices so that m=9 -n, so when n=9, m=0; n=8, m=1; etc.\n\nThen, E_n= E_{9 -m}= F_{m}.\n\nSo, F0=E9=4, F1=E8=13, F2=E7=40, etc.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n=1 +3*E_{n+1}, so F_{m}=1 +3*F_{m-1}.\n\nWait, that might make more sense. So F_{m}=1 +3*F_{m-1}.\n\nYes, because E_{n}=1 +3*E_{n+1}, and since F_{m}=E_{n}=E_{9 -m}, then E_{n+1}=E_{9 -m +1}=E_{10 -m}=F_{m -1}.\n\nThus, F_{m}=1 +3*F_{m -1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence is F_{m}=1 +3*F_{m -1}, with F0=4.\n\nNow, this makes more sense because we can compute F1=1 +3*F0=1 +3*4=13, which matches our earlier computation. Similarly, F2=1 +3*F1=1 +3*13=40, which is correct.\n\nSo, the correct recurrence is F_{m}=1 +3*F_{m -1}, with F0=4.\n\nNow, to solve this recurrence, we can use standard methods for linear recurrences.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is F^{(h)}_{m}=C*3^m.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume F^{(p)}_{m}=A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA=1 +3*A => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is F_{m}=C*3^m -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition F0=4:\n\n4= C*3^0 -1/2 => 4= C -1/2 => C=4 +1/2=9/2.\n\nSo, F_{m}= (9/2)*3^m -1/2.\n\nNow, let's compute F8, which is E1.\n\nF8= (9/2)*3^8 -1/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^4=81, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, F8= (9/2)*6561 -1/2= (9*6561)/2 -1/2.\n\nCompute 9*6561: 6561*9. Let's compute 6561*10=65610, subtract 6561: 65610 -6561=59049.\n\nSo, (59049)/2 -1/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation of E1=29524.\n\nSo, E1=29524, and the total expression is 3*E1=3*29524=88572.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried to model it in terms of E_n=1 +3*E_{n+1}, I had a problem with the general solution giving a negative value, but that was because I had set up the recurrence incorrectly. By redefining F_{m}=E_{9 -m}, and setting up the correct recurrence F_{m}=1 +3*F_{m-1}, I was able to find the correct general solution, which gave me E1=29524, leading to the total expression value of 88572.\n\nSo, to summarize, by computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, and verifying with a general solution to the recurrence relation, I arrived at the answer 88572. I think this is correct, as both methods gave me the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern, we can compute each layer step by step. \n\n1. Start with the innermost expression:\n   - E9 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous step:\n   - E8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - E7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - E6 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - E4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - E3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - E2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - E1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost result by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"
