Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.

Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations.

Alternatively, I could have used the closed-form formula from the start, which might have been more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. It's interesting how recognizing the recurrence relation can lead to a more efficient solution.

    "text": " Therefore, equate coefficients: For 3^n: A = A, which is fine. For constants: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. Good, so the formula seems correct. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So 3^10 is 59049, subtract 1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, the sequence goes 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Each term is 3 times the previous plus 1? Wait, no, actually, each term is 1 + 3*previous. So, it's a linear recurrence where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is indeed a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as I found earlier. So, that's another way to confirm.

Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2= 8/2=4, which matches. Layer 2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. Layer 3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works.

Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I didn't see the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially. Either way, the answer comes out the same. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence relation, we find the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"
