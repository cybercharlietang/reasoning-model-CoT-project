    "text": " Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a recursive formula. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the layers are nine deep, and each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same answer, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can work from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}$. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layers compute to 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, and finally 29524 for the ninth layer.

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n + c1*a_{n-1} + ... = f(n). But in this case, it's a first-order recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.

By breaking it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed by evaluating 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Applying this formula, we determine the value of the innermost layer and propagate it outward.

Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result.

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something. Let me think about whether there's a formula for such a nested expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. This looks similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then added 1. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n + 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r + 3 = 0, so r = -3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*(-3)^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*(-3)^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1. So, 1 = C*(-3)^1 + (-1/2) => 1 = -3C - 1/2 => 3C = -1/2 -1 = -3/2 => C = (-3/2)/(-3) = 1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (1/2)*(-3)^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = ( (-3)^n - 1 ) / 2. So, for each layer n, the value is ( (-3)^n - 1 ) / 2. Wait, let me test this with the first few layers. For n=1, a_1 = ( (-3)^1 -1 ) / 2 = (-3 -1)/2 = (-4)/2 = -2. But wait, when n=1, the innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 4, not -2. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps my indexing is off. Maybe the layers start at n=0? Let's see. Let me check n=0. a_0 = ( (-3)^0 -1 ) / 2 = (1 -1)/2 = 0. But our innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is slightly different. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1? Wait, no. Wait, when we have the innermost layer as 1 + 3, which is 4. So, if we consider the innermost layer as a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches. So, perhaps the formula should be adjusted for the starting index. Let me redefine the recurrence with a_1 = 4. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, the general solution we found earlier was a_n = ( (-3)^n -1 ) / 2, but that didn't match when n=1. So perhaps I need to adjust the initial condition. Let me try to find the particular solution again, considering a different initial condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model it as a geometric series. Let's see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then the next is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. That's nine terms, from layer 1 to layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for the nth term. Let me try again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is as before: a_n^{(h)} = C*(-3)^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 1, we can try a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*(-3)^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*(-3)^1 - 1/2 => 4 = -3C - 1/2 => 3C = -1/2 -4 = -9/2 => C = (-9/2)/(-3) = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*(-3)^n - 1/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3/2)*(-3)^1 - 1/2 = (3/2)*(-3) - 1/2 = (-9/2) - 1/2 = (-10/2) = -5. Wait, that's not correct because a_1 is supposed to be 4. Hmm, I must have made a mistake. Let me check the substitution again. The initial condition is a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*(-3)^1 - 1/2 => 4 = -3C - 1/2. Adding 3C to both sides: 4 + 3C = -1/2. Subtracting 4: 3C = -1/2 -4 = -9/2. So, C = (-9/2)/3 = (-9/2)*(1/3) = -3/2. Therefore, C = -3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (-3/2)*(-3)^n - 1/2. Let's simplify this. (-3/2)*(-3)^n can be written as (-3/2)*(-3)^n. Let's factor out (-3)^n: a_n = (-3)^n * (-3/2) - 1/2 = ( (-3)^{n+1} ) / 2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = ( (-3)^{n+1} -1 ) / 2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = ( (-3)^2 -1 ) / 2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = ( (-3)^3 -1 ) / 2 = (-27 -1)/2 = (-28)/2 = -14. Wait, but earlier, a_2 was 13. That's not matching. Hmm, something's wrong here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me go back. The general solution is a_n = C*(-3)^n - 1/2. Using a_1 =4: 4 = C*(-3)^1 -1/2 => 4 = -3C -1/2 => -3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/(-3) = -3/2. So, a_n = (-3/2)*(-3)^n -1/2. Let's compute a_1: (-3/2)*(-3)^1 -1/2 = (-3/2)*(-3) -1/2 = 9/2 -1/2 =8/2=4. Correct. a_2: (-3/2)*(-3)^2 -1/2 = (-3/2)*9 -1/2 = (-27/2) -1/2 = (-28)/2 = -14. But earlier, a_2 was 13. So, that's a problem. It seems the formula isn't matching the computed values. Therefore, perhaps the approach is flawed, or maybe I misapplied the initial conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm miscounting the layers. Wait, in the problem, the expression has nine layers, starting from the innermost 1+3, then each time adding another 1+3*(...). So, layer 1 is 1+3=4, layer 2 is 1+3*4=13, layer 3 is 1+3*13=40, and so on, up to layer 9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*layer9=88572. So, perhaps trying to find a closed-form formula is complicating things, especially since the layers are only nine. Maybe it's easier to just compute each layer step by step, as I did earlier. Let me confirm the layers again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, perhaps the formula approach isn't necessary here, and step-by-step computation is more straightforward. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\n1.

The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.

Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine 3's. Alternatively, since each layer is similar, maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider how each layer is built. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as I did before. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + (b*(a^n - 1))/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. In our case, a = 3, b = 1, and L_1 = 4. Wait, but in the standard formula, L_0 would be the initial term. Let me see: Let's adjust the indices so that L_1 corresponds to the first layer. Then, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, etc. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, the general solution would be L_n = 3^{n} * L_0 + (1*(3^{n} - 1))/(3 - 1), but we need to adjust for the starting index.

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works.

The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1, it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define a recurrence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent a_n is computed as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), assuming k \u2260 1. In this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, k = 3, c = 1. Let me see if I can express a_n in terms of a_0. Wait, but our initial condition is a_1 = 4, not a_0. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. Let me write down the general solution for a_n where a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 should be 4. Plugging n=1 into the formula: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 should be 13. Plugging into the formula: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10} first. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, 3^{10} = 59049. Then, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. I started by recognizing the nested structure and decided to compute each layer from the inside out. I computed each layer step by step, which took me from 4 up to 29524. Then, I multiplied by 3 to get the final answer, 88572. Additionally, I derived a general formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation, which allowed me to compute the 9th layer directly as (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get the same result. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can compute each layer step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. This looks similar to a geometric series, but with a twist because each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can model this. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, this step-by-step approach seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2: 59048 /2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula directly without computing each layer. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Divided by 2: 177144 /2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern leading to the final result. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we derive a closed-form formula confirming the result. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 /2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) But notice that inside E, the part after the first 1 + 3* is similar to E/3, but not exactly. Wait, perhaps I can write E in terms of itself. Let me see: Let me define E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), where there are 9 layers. But actually, E is the entire expression, which is 3*(...), and inside that, the inner expression is similar but one layer less. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, since there are 9 layers, each time adding another 3*(...). Maybe I can think of it as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Let me consider each layer as a term in a sum. Let me see: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\n\nWait, no, 1 + 3 = 4, which is 3 + 1.\n\nThen, the next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3*(3 + 1) + 1 = 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nWait, 3^2 is 9, plus 3 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Let's see: 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 27 + 9 + 3 +1=40. Yes, that works.\n\nSimilarly, layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Which is 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 +1=81+27+9+3+1=121.\n\nSo, it seems that each layer a_n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k.

And the sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula I found earlier.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = sum_{k=0}^9 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then E = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, E = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.

Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be solved using a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me think about it. Let's define each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Let me derive it properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this: For n=1: (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, which matches my earlier computation. So the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier result. Therefore, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To double-check, let me compute a few more layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Which matches my earlier calculation. n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works, and thus the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a geometric series or something. Let me see if I can find a formula for such a nested expression. Let's define L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1. The homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L(4) = (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms it. Alternatively, since L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L(n) = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*L(9)= (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to compute it using the formula. Either way, the result is the same. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe we can find a closed-form solution for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant. To find C, we can solve the equation by substituting into the recurrence. Let's assume a_n = C*3^{n} + K. Wait, perhaps it's better to solve the recurrence properly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, a constant. Substituting into the equation: A - 3*A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.

Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.

Wait, let me check that. Let me compute a few terms to see. For n=1: a_1 = 4. Using the formula: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, which is not 4. Hmm, maybe my initial condition is wrong. Wait, when n=1, a_1=4. Let me try to find the correct formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's compute a few terms using the recurrence: a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, a_4=1+3*40=121, a_5=1+3*121=364, a_6=1+3*364=1093, a_7=1+3*1093=3280, a_8=1+3*3280=9841, a_9=1+3*9841=29524. Now, let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.

Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to derive it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's expand a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*4 = 1 + 3 + 12 = 16? Wait, no, that's not matching. Wait, a_3 is 40, not 16. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong. Let me try expanding a_n. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2} = 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*a_{n-3}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*a_{n-3} Continuing this way, we can see that a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n}*a_0. But wait, our initial condition is a_1 = 4, so when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, which would mean 4 = 1 + 3*a_0, so a_0 = (4 - 1)/3 = 1. So, a_0 = 1. Then, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^{n}*a_0. Since a_0 =1, this becomes a_n = (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) + 3^{n}*1 = (3^n -1)/2 + 3^n = (3^n -1 + 2*3^n)/2 = (3^n + 2*3^n -1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k is (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Then, a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 + 3^{n} * a_0. But a_0 is 1, so a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 + 3^{n} = (3^{n} -1 + 2*3^{n})/2 = (3^{n} + 2*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values we have. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, correct.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me model it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the recurrence into this form. L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} Let\u2019s substitute L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B into the equation: L_n = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, since L_n = A*3^n + B, we can equate the two expressions: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form, the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result.

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, but in a geometric series, each term is a constant ratio times the previous term, but here, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. It might be a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 ... a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which also matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I had used the formula from the start, I could have directly computed a_9 and then multiplied by 3 without computing each layer. That might have saved time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern and using recurrence relations can simplify the problem. I think this approach is more efficient and less error-prone, especially for larger numbers of layers. But for nine layers, both methods work. So, to recap: The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By recognizing the recurrence relation, I found a closed-form formula, computed the value for the ninth layer, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final answer. I double-checked each step, and both the iterative computation and the formula gave the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall the formula for such a recurrence. The recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which in this case, a=1 and b=3. The solution to this recurrence is L_n = a*b^{n} + c, but I might need to adjust that. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let me write the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The homogeneous solution satisfies a(n) = 3*a(n-1). The solution to that is a(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a(1) = 4.

So, yes, that seems to be the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the sequence goes: a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. So, the nth term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which is correct. n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's consistent with what I found earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer again. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, it's similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but with an added constant each time. But since I've already found a closed-form solution, I think that's sufficient. So, to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from 1+3, then 1+3*(previous result), and so on. 3. After computing up to the 9th layer, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. 4. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula for the nth term using recurrence relations and verify it with the step-by-step computation. 5. Both methods led to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\).

The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant, say A.

So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Maybe my initial terms are off. Let me think again. The first term is a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1. Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then the particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.

The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.

The expression seems to be of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. First, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4. Then Layer 2 is a_2, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that's another way to confirm that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we can see that each term is multiplied by 3 each time, starting from the innermost term. So, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but in this case, it's a bit more complicated because each term is nested. But using the recurrence relation method, we found that each layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives us 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

Alternatively, this looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. Then the total expression is 3*L_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see. Let me consider the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B => Simplify the right-hand side: 3*A*3^{n-1} = A*3^n, so: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step seems to follow logically, and the general formula for L_n confirms the result. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

This process is repeated for each layer up to the ninth layer, resulting in 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

So, starting from 1, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That's similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which resembles a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, to find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.

The formula for a_n is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me see, solving the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). So, c = 3c => c=0, which doesn't help. Alternatively, the particular solution can be found. Let me assume a particular solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a geometric series or something similar. Let me represent each layer mathematically. Let\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 And so on, up to L9. Then the entire expression is 3*L9. So, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).

Let me check if this formula works for the layers I've already computed. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.

Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.
