    "text": " Let me try to parse this. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, the next layer is 3 times that, plus 1, and so on. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I start from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and so on. So, let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9. So, layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait a minute, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, if layer 9 is 29524, then the total is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the total is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Suppose I define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw earlier. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recursive formula. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. So, the sequence goes 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and the recursive approach and the closed-form formula both give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let me define each layer as a separate term. Let's say the innermost part is just 1 + 3, right? Because that's the last expression inside the parentheses. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me try to write that out step by step. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\n- Let\u2019s call the innermost expression Layer 1: 1 + 3\n- Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- And so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the expression starts with 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. So, maybe each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me try to structure it that way.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWell, 3*29000 = 87000\n\n3*524 = 1572\n\nSo, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nWait, but that seems quite large. Let me check if I did each layer correctly. Maybe I made an error in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's do it step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524*3.\n\nCompute 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I counted the layers correctly. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...). Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections:\n\nFrom the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3. So, let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, as I thought earlier. So, Layer 1 is 1+3, Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9, then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, perhaps my calculation is correct. But 88572 seems like a big number, but given the multiple layers of multiplication, it might be correct.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nLooking at each layer:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 13\n\nLayer3: 40\n\nLayer4: 121\n\nLayer5: 364\n\nLayer6: 1093\n\nLayer7: 3280\n\nLayer8: 9841\n\nLayer9: 29524\n\nI notice that each Layer n is 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, that's a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2=1 + 3*a_1=1 + 3*4=13.\n\nUsing the general solution for n=2: a_2= A*3^{2} + B=9A + B=13.\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n3A + B = 4\n\n9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A= 9/6= 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A=3/2 into the first equation:\n\n3*(3/2) + B=4 => 9/2 + B=4 => B=4 - 9/2= (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1:\n\na_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer9, which is a_9, we can compute it as:\n\na_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, yes, Layer9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so Layer1 is the innermost, and Layer9 is the outermost before the final 3.\n\nSo, yes, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula I derived, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is 1 more than 3 times the previous layer, which is a geometric progression with a ratio of 3, but offset by 1 each time. So, the formula I found makes sense because it's a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added.\n\nI think I've verified it sufficiently. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, starting from the innermost parentheses. By calculating each layer step by step and using a derived formula for the nth layer, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers, with the entire expression multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, that might work. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nSo, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Plugging in Layer 1's value: 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate 3*13 first. 3 times 10 is 30, and 3 times 3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, add 1: 39 + 1 = 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So, 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, add 1: 363 + 1 = 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.

Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.

So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, and 4*3=12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to compute 3*29524 is to multiply each digit by 3, starting from the right:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with multiple layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLooks like all the layers check out. So, I think my answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be applied here to solve it more efficiently without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive relation. Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, the recurrence relation is:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nWith the base case L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: L(4) = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: L(5) = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: L(6) = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: L(7) = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: L(8) = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works for all the layers. So, using this formula, I can compute any layer without having to go through each step, which is much more efficient.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have Layer 9, which is L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L(9)), and L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2, then 3*L(9) = 3*(3^10 - 1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, another way to compute the entire expression is to recognize that it's 3 times L(9), which is (3^11 - 3)/2 = 88572.\n\nThis method is much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. It's good to know that the closed-form solution exists for such recursive problems.\n\nBut since I already computed each layer step by step and confirmed that the final result is 88572, I can be confident that this is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly, checked each step, and even derived a general formula to confirm the result. So, I feel pretty certain that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is defined as follows:\n\nLayer 1: \\(1 + 3\\)\nLayer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1}\\)\nLayer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2}\\)\n...\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\):\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, Layer 1 is (1 + 3). Then Layer 2 is 3*(Layer 1 + 1), wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Hmm, maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost parentheses first. Let's define each layer step by step. Let me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost. So, Layer 1: (1 + 3) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, maybe I should compute each layer starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, then multiply the result by 3. Let me try that. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That was simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 363 + 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final result of 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the right solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By systematically computing each layer and multiplying the final result by 3, we find the solution to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to parse this. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result. Let me write this out step by step. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3. Then, L2 = 1 + 3 * L1. L3 = 1 + 3 * L2, and so on, up to L9, which is the outermost expression, and then the entire problem is 3 * L9. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so maybe L9 is the innermost, and then each layer out adds another 3*(...). Let me try to structure this. Let me define each layer starting from the innermost. Let me start counting from the innermost. So, the innermost is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(L1). So, L2 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, L2 = 13. Now, moving out another layer, L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, L3 = 40. Next layer out, L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. L4 = 121. Now, L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. L5 = 364. Continuing, L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. So, L6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L6 = 1093. Next, L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. So, L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L7 = 3280. Moving on to L8: L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Thus, L8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L8 = 9841. Finally, the outermost layer, L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, L9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times L9, right? Wait, no, let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by L9, which we just computed as 29524. So, the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me write out the first few terms to see the pattern:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nI can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So, when n=1, L1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for L9, which is the 9th layer, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated before. So, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.

    "text": " Let me define each layer as a variable to make it easier. Let me denote each innermost expression as follows: Let\u2019s say the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it would be 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me list them as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. I can compute this step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29524 * 3: Let's do it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572. Hmm, but let me confirm this with another method to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 3*29524 as (30000 + 524)*3 = 30000*3 + 524*3 = 90000 + 1572 = 91572. Wait, that's different from 88572. Oh no, I must have made a mistake in my digit-by-digit calculation. Let me check again. 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me write it down:\n\n   29524\nx      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. But wait, when I did the alternative method, I got 91572. There's a discrepancy here, which means I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check the alternative method again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3: Let's break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nOkay, so the correct result is 88572. I must have made a mistake in my alternative method earlier. I think I added 30000 instead of 29524, which was incorrect. So, the correct total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check where I might have gone wrong in the earlier steps. I think I might have miscalculated L9. Let me go back and compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I did the alternative method, I thought I had a different result, but now I see that it's 88572. So, maybe my initial alternative method was wrong because I miscalculated. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to be absolutely sure. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2 with carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5 with carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8 with carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is 29524. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing L9.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nYes, all these steps look correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), and each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which gives us 88572.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, all correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't find any errors in my reasoning or calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of the form 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. \n\n1. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost out:\n   - L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's denote the innermost expression as Layer 1, then the next one as Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, until Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). That sounds manageable. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going. Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Okay, so Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000 9000*3 = 27000 500*3 = 1500 20*3 = 60 4*3 = 12 Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. It's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me verify each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

    "text": " Let me try to identify the innermost expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3 times that innermost expression. Then the next layer is 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer, and so on. So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me assign variables to each layer to keep track of the results. Let's say:\n\n- Let a = 1 + 3\n- Then, b = 1 + 3a\n- Then, c = 1 + 3b\n- And so on, up to the ninth layer.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3 times the entire expression, so maybe I should also consider that. Let me see. The outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, perhaps I should compute the nested part first and then multiply by 3 at the end. Alternatively, maybe each layer is multiplied by 3 as I go outward. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to write it down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nCompute (1 + 3): 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost part is 4.\n\nNow, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\n2. Compute 1 + 3*4: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, the next layer is 13.\n\nMoving outward another layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13.\n\n3. Compute 1 + 3*13: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, now we have 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40.\n\n4. Compute 1 + 3*40: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nSo, 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121.\n\n5. Compute 1 + 3*121: 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nSo, 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364.\n\n6. Compute 1 + 3*364: 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSo, 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093.\n\n7.

But wait, let me check the original expression again. The original expression is 3 times the nested expression. So, after computing the nested part as 29524, we have to multiply that by 3.\n\n10. Compute 3*29524: 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\nThen, 3*500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\nThen, 3*24 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems off because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, so 3 times each part is 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72, which adds up to 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this multiplication another way to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the placement of the digits. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73 =12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d73=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.

But I think I might have missed a digit because the original problem had nine layers, each adding a 3*(1+...), so maybe I should have nine layers. Let me recount how many layers I computed.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of (1+3(...)) sections: Let's see.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3*...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses before the first closing one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1 +3(...) appears. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 +3) \u2192 1 layer\n\nThen, each next layer adds another (1 +3*(...)).\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, each time we have 1 +3*(...), so starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 +3)\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1 +3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 1 +3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, I think I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nLet me write down the layers:\n\nLayer1: (1 +3) =4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but when I counted the layers, I think I have 9 layers, each corresponding to each set of parentheses. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in any of the computations.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer1:1 +3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1.\n\nSo, a_1 =1 +3=4\n\na_2=1 +3*a1=1 +3*4=13\n\na_3=1 +3*a2=1 +3*13=40\n\nAnd so on, up to a9=1 +3*a8=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find B, let's set a_n = B. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB =1 +3*B \u21d2 B -3B =1 \u21d2 -2B=1 \u21d2 B= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 \u21d24 =3A -1/2 \u21d23A=4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2A= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nWait, let me check for n=1:\n\na1= (3^{2} -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na2=(3^3 -1)/2=27 -1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na3=(3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\na9=(3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the multiplication steps.\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d73 again.\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 2\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nBreak down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 \u00d73=60000\n\n9000 \u00d73=27000\n\n500 \u00d73=1500\n\n24 \u00d73=72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +72=88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula approach, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Then, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), but actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me write this out step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Good, so that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led me to the same conclusion. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Recognizing this pattern allows us to derive a closed-form solution using a recurrence relation. The final computation confirms that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Outermost Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification Using Recurrence Relation:**\n   - The recurrence relation is \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n   - Solving this gives \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n   - For \\(n = 9\\), \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Then L2 would be 1 + 3*(L1), L3 would be 1 + 3*(L2), and so on, until L9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9). That seems manageable. Let me try that approach. Let's start with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving outward, L2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so L2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Cool, that's straightforward. Next, L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13: that's 39. So, L3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so L3 is 40. Moving on to L4: L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so L4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, that's getting big quickly. Let me keep going. L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so L5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, so L5 is 364. Next, L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. So, L6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wow, that's a jump. Now, L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Therefore, L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Hmm, okay, so L7 is 3280. Next, L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Therefore, L8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Wow, that's massive. Finally, L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Therefore, L9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the final result is 88,572.

    "text": " Let me try to parse the innermost expression first. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost parentheses evaluate to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). Since the previous result was 4, this would be 1 + 3*4. Let me calculate that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving another layer out, the expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). The previous result was 13, so this becomes 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, this layer is 40. Hmm, interesting. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. So far, the results are 4, 13, 40. Let me compute a few more layers to see if a pattern emerges. Next layer: (1 + 3*(previous result)) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. So, that's 121.

Let's calculate 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280). Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Moving out another layer: (1 + 3*9841). Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Next layer: (1 + 3*29524). Let's compute 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9524=28572. So, 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Then 1 + 88572 = 88573. Finally, the outermost layer: (1 + 3*88573). Let's calculate 3*88573: 3*80000=240000, 3*8573=25719. Adding those together: 240000 + 25719 = 265719. Then 1 + 265719 = 265720. So, the innermost parentheses worked their way out, each time multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, after computing all nine layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 265720. But wait, hold on. Let me double-check that because I might have miscounted the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s after the first 3(1+...). It's 9 instances of 3(...). So, there are 9 layers. Therefore, I should have computed 9 layers, each time evaluating the innermost first. Wait, but when I started, I took the innermost as (1+3), then computed up to 265720, which is 9 layers. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the innermost expression evaluates to 265720. But wait, no. Wait, actually, each time, we're computing (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, starting from (1+3) = 4, then next is (1 + 3*4) = 13, then (1 + 3*13) = 40, and so on until we reach the 9th layer, which is 265720. So, that would be the value of the innermost expression when all layers are evaluated. But the original expression is 3 times that. So, the entire expression is 3*(innermost result). So, 3*265720. Let me compute that: 3*200000=600000, 3*65720=197160. Wait, 3*265720: 3*200000=600000, 3*60000=180000, 3*5000=15000, 3*700=2100, 3*20=60. Adding all together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000; 780000 + 15000 = 795000; 795000 + 2100 = 797100; 797100 + 60 = 797160. So, 3*265720 = 797160. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 797160. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make an error in any step. Let me go through each layer again more carefully. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 1: 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, hold on, I think I messed up earlier. When I was calculating the layers, I went beyond 9 layers, but there are only 9 layers. Let me recount. The original expression has 9 layers of (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1+3)=4. Then layer 2: (1 + 3*4)=13. Layer 3: (1 + 3*13)=40. Layer 4: (1 + 3*40)=121. Layer 5: (1 + 3*121)=364. Layer 6: (1 + 3*364)=1093. Layer 7: (1 + 3*1093)=3280. Layer 8: (1 + 3*3280)=9841. Layer 9: (1 + 3*9841)=29524. So, after 9 layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that: 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, that's different from my earlier result of 797160. So, I must have miscounted the number of layers before. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions. Starting from the first one after the initial 3: 1. (1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many layers? Let's see: Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then each layer wraps around it with another (1 + 3*(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)) starting from the innermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections. Each time, it's 1 + 3 followed by another (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me see: The innermost is (1 + 3). Then the next is (1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Then the next is (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), etc. So, how many layers? Each (1 + 3(...)) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1 + 3). Then layer 2: (1 + 3*(layer1)). Layer3: (1 + 3*(layer2)), etc., up to layer9. So, there are 9 layers. Therefore, when I computed up to layer9, I should have stopped at 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But earlier, I thought I had 9 layers and computed up to 265720, which was incorrect because I had more layers. So, actually, the correct result is 88572. Let me verify this by computing each layer step by step again. Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4. Layer2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try to compute it another way. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula for such expressions. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 would actually be (1 + 3) = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. The solution is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). In this case, our recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, let me define it properly. Let me set n=1: a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, the general solution for this kind of recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Plugging in the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, we have: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I obtained earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that: 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. To make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify 3*29524 in another way. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula for the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the result is 88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Let me define each layer as a step. Let's say the innermost part is step 1, then each step moving outward is the next layer. So, step 1 is 1 + 3, right? Because that's the innermost part. Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so step 1 is 4. Then, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(step 1). Since step 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So step 2 is 13. Moving outward again, the next layer is 1 + 3*(step 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So step 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, so step 3 is 40. Next layer is 1 + 3*(step 3), which is 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So step 4 is 121. Wow, these numbers are getting big quickly. Let me keep going. Next, step 5 would be 1 + 3*(step 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So step 5 is 364. Step 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So step 6 is 1093. Step 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So step 7 is 3280. Step 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So step 8 is 9841. Finally, step 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523. Wait, 841*3: 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3, so 2400 + 120 is 2520, plus 3 is 2523. So 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So step 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this step 9 result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Let me do it more accurately. 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, and 3*24 is 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost parentheses: step 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Step 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Step 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Step 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Step 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Step 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Step 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step is 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. So, 29524*3 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after computing each step carefully and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute one of the steps again to check. Let's pick step 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 4*3 is 12, 6*3 is 18, 3*3 is 9. So, 364*3 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Correct. Similarly, step 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279=3279. 3279 + 1=3280. Correct. Okay, I think I've verified enough steps. It seems like my approach is correct, and each step follows logically from the previous one.

Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's possible. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Next, 1 + 3*13 = 40, yes. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121, that's right. Then, 1 + 3*121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Next, 1 + 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Then, 1 + 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Next, 1 + 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Then, 1 + 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: As I computed earlier, that's 88572. So, each step seems correct. Therefore, I think the final answer is 88572. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I feel confident about this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me number the layers for clarity. Let's consider the innermost expression first: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(the result from the previous layer), and so on. So, if I work from the inside out, each step will build upon the previous one. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, since it's nested, maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way outwards. So, let's define each layer as follows: L1 = 1 + 3 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 ... and so on until L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9. Hmm, but in the given problem, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is the result of the innermost expression built up through 9 layers. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, seems like each step is tripling the previous result and adding 1. Let me check that. So, L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40. Now, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Okay, so L9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times L9, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again quickly: L1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f L2:1+3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f L3:1+3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f L4:1+3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f L5:1+3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f L6:1+3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f L7:1+3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f L8:1+3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f L9:1+3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then 3*29524: Let me compute it again: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88572. Yes, that matches. So, I think my answer is correct.

    "text": " Let me try that. Let's denote the innermost expression as E1: E1 = 1 + 3 Then, moving out one layer, we have E2 = 1 + 3*E1 Then E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9, and then the entire expression is 3*E9. So, if I compute E1 first, then E2, and so on, I can build up the solution step by step. Let me try that approach. Starting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving out one layer, E2 is 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, E2 becomes: E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Now, E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so: E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let me keep going. E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, so let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 So, putting it all together, each step builds upon the previous one, and by working from the innermost parentheses outward, I can compute each layer step by step.

    "text": " Let me start by identifying the innermost parentheses. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. So, let's compute that first. Innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, let's compute that. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from innermost). Since the innermost was 4, this would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that layer gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result, which was 13. So, 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, this layer is 40. Next, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 40. So, 1 + 3*40. Let's see: 3*40 = 120, plus 1 is 121. So, now we're at 121. Continuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that: 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Hmm, so that's 364. Next, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate that: 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, adding 1 gives us 1093. So, that layer is 1093. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093 first. Well, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9, so adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives us 3280. So, that's 3280. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so adding those gives 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, that layer is 9841. Next layer out is 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate that. 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, and 3*1 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, this layer is 29524. Finally, moving out to the outermost layer, it's 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*29524: Let's see, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives us 88573. So, the innermost parentheses worked their way out to 88573. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 times that. So, the entire expression is 3*(88573). Let me compute that. 3*88573: Let's break it down. 3*80000 = 240000, 3*8000 = 24000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*70 = 210, and 3*3 = 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 = 265719. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 265,719. Wait a second, that seems like a big number. Let me verify my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back and check each step carefully. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Finally, 3*88573 = 265719. Hmm, seems like each step checks out. So, the final answer is 265,719. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the number of layers. So, starting from the innermost, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. a_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Wait, so the outermost layer is a_10, which is 88573, and then the entire expression is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see, since each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches a_2. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which is a_3. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost parentheses correspond to a_1, and each subsequent layer corresponds to a_2, a_3, etc., up to a_9, since there are nine layers. Wait, actually, let me check that. Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, but wait, no, the entire expression is 3*(a_9). Wait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine layers inside. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the indices. Let me clarify: Each time we have a new layer, we're adding another a_n. So, the innermost is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, up to a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 10 layers, but perhaps that's because I included the outermost 3*(...). Let me recount. The original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is a_1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many a_n terms do we have? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, after the first 3(1 + 3(...), there are nine more layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, that would mean a_1 is the innermost (1 + 3), and a_9 is the ninth layer. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I ended up with 88573 before multiplying by 3, leading to 265719. Now, using the formula, I get a_9 = 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Which one is correct? Let me check my step-by-step again. Earlier, I had:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\na1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\na10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a10 = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nBut using the formula, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, so 3*a9 = 88572.\n\nWait, so which is correct? There's a conflict here. Let me see where I might have gone wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the number of layers in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...3(1 + 3(...\n3. ...3(1 + 3(...\n4. ...3(1 + 3(...\n5. ...3(1 + 3(...\n6. ...3(1 + 3(...\n7. ...3(1 + 3(...\n8. ...3(1 + 3(...\n9. ...3(1 + 3))\n\nSo, there are nine layers after the initial 3. Therefore, the innermost is a1, and the outermost is a9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9, which would be 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step earlier, I went up to a10, which would imply that the outermost layer is a10, making the entire expression 3*a10 = 265719.\n\nSo, where is the confusion?\n\nWait, perhaps I included an extra layer when counting. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's a1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the first layer after the innermost is 1 + 3*a1, which is a2. Then, the next is 1 + 3*a2 = a3, and so on, until the ninth layer, which is 1 + 3*a8 = a9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9.\n\nWait, so perhaps in my initial step-by-step, I went one layer too far. Let me recount:\n\n1. a1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. a2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. a3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. a4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. a5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. a6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. a7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. a8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. a9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after nine layers, a9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I was computing step by step, I went up to a10 = 88573, which would mean that the entire expression is 3*a10 = 265719. But that seems inconsistent with the formula.\n\nWait, so where is the mistake? Let me check the formula again. The formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the step-by-step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\nAfter a9 = 29524, I computed a10 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. But that's incorrect because the original expression only has nine layers, so the outermost layer is a9, not a10. Therefore, the correct value is 3*a9 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier step-by-step where I ended up with 265719. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount the number of layers in the original expression. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3\n\nSo, there are nine opening parentheses after the initial 3, which means nine layers. Therefore, the innermost is a1, and the outermost is a9, so the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to a10, which would be the tenth layer, implying that the expression has ten layers, but that's not the case. Therefore, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I added an extra layer beyond the nine required. Therefore, the correct answer should be 88572, not 265719.\n\nWait, but that seems conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me write out the expression with each layer numbered:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, Layer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88572, not 265719. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial step-by-step by considering an extra layer.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to a10 = 88573, which would be Layer 10, but the original expression only has nine layers. Therefore, the correct answer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I thought the entire expression was 3*(1 + 3*(...)) up to nine layers, which would be 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut then, why did I get 265719 earlier? Because I incorrectly considered ten layers, adding an extra a10. So, that was my mistake.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this again using the formula. a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a9 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to a10 = 88573, which would be 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, and then 3*88573 = 265719. But that's incorrect because the original expression only has nine layers, so the outermost layer is a9, not a10.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. The problem is: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3\n\nSo, nine opening parentheses, meaning nine layers. Therefore, the innermost is a1, and the outermost is a9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, my initial mistake was considering an extra layer, leading to the incorrect answer of 265719. The correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with the formula again. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, so 3*a9 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to a10 = 88573, which would be if there were ten layers. So, perhaps the problem is that I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me write out the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 265719. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial step-by-step by considering an extra layer. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again to ensure that I'm not miscounting the layers.\n\nThe problem is: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nLet me write it out with each layer:\n\n- The outermost layer is 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...).\n\n- Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on, until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nEach time we add another layer, it's another \"1 + 3(\".\n\nSo, the original expression has nine \"1 + 3(\" layers inside the initial 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think my initial mistake was in considering that the outermost 3*(...) was an additional layer, making it ten layers, but that's not the case. The original expression only has nine layers inside the initial 3*(...), so the correct computation is up to a9, leading to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the formula again. If a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, so 3*a9 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572, not 265719. I must have miscounted the layers in my initial step-by-step, leading to the incorrect result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression using the formula without step-by-step computation.\n\nGiven that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*a9, where n=9.\n\nSo, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid now. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost result is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, leading to the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost Layer):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Expression:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try that. Let's denote each layer as a level. So, the innermost expression is at level 1: Level 1: 1 + 3. Then, level 2 would be 1 + 3*(result from level 1). Level 3: 1 + 3*(result from level 2). And so on, up to level 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(result from level 9). Wait, no, looking back, the outermost expression is 3*(something). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, each 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, so maybe there are nine 3s multiplied by expressions. Wait, no, let me count again. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the left: 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ...)). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" segments. Each time after a 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3*(...), and that inner part repeats. So, maybe the innermost part is at the ninth level. So, perhaps I can compute each level step by step, starting from the innermost and working my way out. Let me try that. Let's define each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\n...\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, I can compute Level 1 first, then Level 2, and so on, up to Level 9, and then multiply by 3. Let me compute each level step by step.\n\nStarting with Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, Level 2 is 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot it. Now, Level 3 is 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWow, that's a jump. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. So, Level 3 was 40, so 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Yep, that's correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so Level 5: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nOkay, moving on.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092.\n\nSo, Level 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nAlright, Level 6 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279.\n\nThus, Level 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, 3279 +1 is 3280? Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840.\n\nThus, Level 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nOkay, that's a big number, but let's go on.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.\n\nSo, adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523.\n\nTherefore, Level 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, so Level 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nWait, no, let me compute it more carefully. Let's break down 29524 into digits:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nSo, 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nMultiply each by 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from Level 1 to Level 9:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each level step by step. Let me think about that for a moment. The expression resembles a geometric series or something similar, but it's nested, so perhaps it's a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, each level is a term in this sequence, where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, which we found to be 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

    "text": " Let me see. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That should be straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, (1 + 3) is 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me write this down step by step. Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple. Now Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 2 result is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 result is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 result is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 result is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 result is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 result is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 result is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 result is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Hmm, let me break it down. 3*29524 = 3*(29000 + 524) = 3*29000 + 3*524. 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the result of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: 3*29524, let's compute 29524*3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add: 59048 + 29524. 8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. 4 + 2 +1=7, write down 7. 0 + 5=5. 9 + 9=18, write down 8, carryover 1. 5 + 2 +1=8. So, 88572. Yep, same result. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer's result is used in the next. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is multiplied by 3. The step-by-step computation confirms that the final value is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to parse the innermost expression first. The innermost part is (1 + 3), right? Because that's the last one before the closing parenthesis. So, starting there: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So, next layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. Wait, no, hold on. Actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, maybe I should think of each step as computing 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me see. Let me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost. Let's say layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1), layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2), and so on, up to layer 9, which is the outermost expression. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). Hmm, that might work.

Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, yes, that's correct. The final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, when I started with layer1 as the innermost, I had to go up to layer9, which is correct because each additional set of parentheses adds another layer. So, that should be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but since each layer is defined recursively, it's probably easier to compute each layer step by step. Let me try another approach just to verify.\n\nSuppose I define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I compute a_1 through a_9, I should get the same result.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, total expression = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Since a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the formula for the linear recurrence, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but given that each term is nested within the previous one, it's more of a recursive structure. However, using the formula for the linear recurrence was efficient and gave me the same result as the step-by-step computation.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. The formula for the nth term is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula up to the 9th layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me label each layer to make it easier. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (but wait, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? But then that's multiplied by 3 in the next layer. Let me check: The innermost expression is 1 + 3, then that is multiplied by 3 in the next layer, which is 1 + 3*(Layer1). Then that result is multiplied by 3 in the next layer, and so on. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward. Let me define each layer as follows: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) and so on, up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). Wait, no, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would correspond to Layer 9 being the innermost 1 + 3, then Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer9), and so on, until Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer2), and the entire expression is 3*(Layer1). Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my labeling. Alternatively, perhaps I should start by computing the innermost parentheses first and work my way out. Let me try that. The innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 1 + 39 = 40. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me verify each multiplication to be sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, plus 3*1=3, so 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let's compute that: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. So yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3.\n\nThen each layer out adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nUp to the 9th layer? Wait, the original problem has nine sets of parentheses inside each other. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then 1+3(...). Each time, the number of opening parentheses increases by one. Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen each next layer adds another 1+3(...\n\nSo, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 instances of 1+3, each nested inside the previous one. Therefore, there are 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was correct, leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut let me confirm this with a different approach, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis seems consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general form is a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier terms:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, each layer's value is computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to find the value of the innermost layer and then compute the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the innermost outward**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me label each part to make it clearer. Let's define each innermost expression first. Let me denote the innermost part as A1, then the next one as A2, and so on, until A9, which would be the outermost expression. But wait, actually, let me count the number of nested expressions. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each time it's 1 + 3*(previous expression). Let me see how many times this happens. Let's parse the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is the first one. Let me call this A1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next one is 1 + 3*(A1). Let me call this A2 = 1 + 3*A1.\n\nThen the next one is A3 = 1 + 3*A2.\n\nContinuing this way, each time, the next layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, there's a 1 + 3(...). Let me count:\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI see that after the first 3, there are 8 more layers of 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and then each time wrapping another 1 + 3 around it. So, in total, there are 9 layers, right? Because starting from the innermost as layer 1, up to layer 9. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from layer 1 up to layer 9, and then multiply by 3 at the end. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(A9), where A9 is 1 + 3*A8, and so on, down to A1 = 1 + 3. So, let me try to compute each A from A1 to A9.\n\nStarting with A1:\n\nA1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, A2 = 1 + 3*A1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, A3 = 1 + 3*A2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nA4 = 1 + 3*A3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nA5 = 1 + 3*A4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nA6 = 1 + 3*A5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nA7 = 1 + 3*A6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nA8 = 1 + 3*A7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nA9 = 1 + 3*A8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(A9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but actually, 29524 is 29,524.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nMultiply each digit by 3, starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n----------\n\nLet's compute:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but 29,524 * 3 is actually 88,572? Let me verify with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 30,000 *3=90,000, so 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 29,524 *3 = 90,000 - (476*3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the A9 value. Let me go back through the layers step by step to ensure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with A1:\n\nA1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nA2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nA3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nA4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nA5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nA6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nA7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nA8 = 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nA9 = 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, A9=29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*A9=3*29,524=88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, it's 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears as a nested expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are 8 instances of 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each next layer wraps another 1+3 around it, so total layers would be 9? Wait, no, because the first 3 is multiplied by the first (1+3(...)), which itself has 8 layers. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think of it as a chain of 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost as layer 1, then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), and so on up to layer9, which is the outermost expression inside the initial 3*(...). So, in that case, the initial expression is 3*(layer9). So, if I computed layer1 to layer9 correctly, then 3*(layer9) would be the answer.\n\nWait, but when I computed A1 through A9, I started with A1=1+3, then A2=1+3*A1, and so on up to A9=1+3*A8. So, that would mean that the outermost expression is 3*(A9). So, that should be correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check the number of layers again. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, the structure is:\n\n3*(layer1), where layer1 is (1+3*(layer2)), and layer2 is (1+3*(layer3)), etc., until the innermost layer, which is (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = layer1.\n\nThen, layer2 is (1+3*(layer1)).\n\nThen, layer3 is (1+3*(layer2)).\n\nContinuing until layer9, which would be the outermost layer before the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many times does 1+3 appear as a separate term? Let me count:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3)\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nAnd so on, each time adding another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears as a nested expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\nAfter the initial 3, there are 8 more layers of 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3, so total layers would be 9. Therefore, when I computed A1 through A9, that should be correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed A1=1+3=4, then A2=1+3*4=13, and so on up to A9=29,524, then the entire expression is 3*A9=88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote the nth layer as An, then An = 1 + 3*An-1, with A1=1+3=4.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as An = 1 + 3*An-1, starting from A1=4.\n\nI can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for An.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is An - 3*An-1 = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is An - 3*An-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say An = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is An = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition A1=4.\n\nWhen n=1, A1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is An = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, An = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, A9 would be (3^(9+1) - 1)/2 = (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\nCalculating 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, A9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier for A9. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*29524=88572.\n\nHence, the solution is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the initial step-by-step computation of A1 through A9. Let me go through each step again.\n\nA1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nA2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nA3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nA4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nA5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nA6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nA7 = 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nA8 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nA9 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400=29,400, +120=29,520, +3=29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29,524 again.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I don't see any mistakes. The approach of solving each nested layer step by step and then using the closed-form formula both led me to the same result, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer.

    "text": " Let me try to parse this. The innermost part is (1 + 3), right? Because it's the last one inside all those parentheses. So, if I compute that first, then work my way outwards. Let me try that. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9 or something. Wait, maybe I should number them from the inside out. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as E1, E2, E3, etc., starting from the innermost one.\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3*(E9).

Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nWait, but when I first looked at the problem, it was 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, E9 would be the innermost, and each subsequent E adds another layer. So, maybe I have to go one more step? Let me check how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis is one layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost. Let me count how many times 1+3(...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI think the number of nested expressions is 9, because starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around with 1+3*(previous layer). So, E1 is 1+3, E2 is 1+3*E1, and so on until E9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9. So, as I calculated before, E9 is 29,524, and 3*29,524 is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of times '1+' appears in the expression. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, the innermost is 1+3, so each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, E1 is the innermost, E2 is next, up to E9, which is the expression before the outermost 3*(...). Therefore, the total expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems quite a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication somewhere.\n\nLet me recalculate each E step by step:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Now, 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nThere's no more digits, so write down 27 + any carry, which is 27 + 0 = 27, but wait, no, wait: 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n*       3\n\n________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nWait, the expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume E_n^{(p)} = K, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition E1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches.\n\nSimilarly, E3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have E9, that would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, since E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*E9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*E9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I can't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation method gave the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by working from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Define each nested expression as \\(E_n\\), starting from the innermost one.\n2. Calculate each \\(E_n\\) using the recurrence relation \\(E_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_{n-1}\\) with \\(E_1 = 4\\).\n\nLet's compute each layer:\n\n- \\(E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- \\(E_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13\\)\n- \\(E_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40\\)\n- \\(E_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121\\)\n- \\(E_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364\\)\n- \\(E_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093\\)\n- \\(E_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280\\)\n- \\(E_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841\\)\n- \\(E_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\cdot E_9\\):\n\n- \\(3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let's start by labeling each layer to keep track. Let me denote the innermost expression as A9, then the next one as A8, and so on, until the outermost expression is A1. So, A9 = 1 + 3. Then A8 = 1 + 3*A9, A7 = 1 + 3*A8, and so on, up to A1 = 1 + 3*A2, and the entire expression is 3*A1. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(A1), where A1 is 1 + 3*A2, and A2 is 1 + 3*A3, etc. Hmm, maybe that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. So, 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So, the next layer is 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that layer gives us 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so this layer gives 40. Wait, so each time we're doing 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let me list out each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, but let me count how many layers I'm actually dealing with. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, I need to compute nine layers. Let me check my earlier steps again to make sure I didn't skip any.\n\nWait, when I started, I did step 1 as (1 + 3) = 4, which would be the innermost, which is the ninth layer. Then step 2 is the eighth layer, step 3 is the seventh, and so on, until step 9 would be the first layer, which is 1 + 3*(result from the second layer). Then, after that, the entire expression is 3*(result from the first layer). So, let me correct that. Let me go step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward, computing each layer as I go.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to be sure. Maybe I should do it digit by digit.\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's compute:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke it down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, that might not be accurate because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait a second, but when I computed Layer 1, I got 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, the final step is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 9. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so up to layer 1, which is the outermost before the final 3*(...). So, I think I did nine layers correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, a_9 was the innermost, which was 4, then a_8 was 13, and so on, up to a_1 being 29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_1, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let me try to see if that's possible.\n\nEach layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, no, actually, in my earlier approach, a_9 was 4, a_8 was 13, etc. So, maybe if I reverse the indices, let me define a_1 as the innermost, then a_2, up to a_9 being the outermost before the final 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find C. If a_n = C, then substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier for a_1 (since in my earlier approach, a_1 was the outermost layer before the final multiplication, which was 29524). So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the closed-form solution, a_n is defined as the value after n layers, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_9 would indeed be 29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 88572. That confirms my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute this using the closed-form formula, I could directly compute a_9 as (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute a few more layers using the closed-form formula to see if they match my earlier step-by-step.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all of these match my earlier calculations. So, I can be confident that the value of the innermost layers up to a_9 is 29524, and then the total expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the method works. Let's say I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). How much is that?\n\nCompute innermost first: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form: n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, then 3*40=120. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, compute step by step: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Innermost: 1+3=4. Next:1 +3*4=13. Then, 3*13=39. Alternatively, using the formula: n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13, then 3*13=39. Correct.\n\nSo, the method works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Let me try to parse this. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result. Let me write each layer separately. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can get the result. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, seems like each layer is getting bigger. Let's keep going.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, that's a big jump. Let me double-check that. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nHmm, okay, moving on.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, so Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let me break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. So adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication another way to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is the first innermost.\n\nThen, each subsequent (1 + 3(...) adds another layer. So, let's see: the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1))\n3. (1 + 3*(2))\n...\nWait, perhaps it's better to see how many times 1 + 3(...) occurs. Let me write the expression with indices to see.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer1))\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer2))\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer8))\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, if I have 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my initial approach was correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me recount the number of layers.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time I see a \"(\", it's a new layer. Let's count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3.\n\n1. 3(...\n2. (1 + 3(...\n3. (1 + 3(...\n4. (1 + 3(...\n5. (1 + 3(...\n6. (1 + 3(...\n7. (1 + 3(...\n8. (1 + 3(...\n9. (1 + 3(...\n10. (1 + 3))\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nStarting from the first \"(\", which is after the initial 3: 3(\n\nThen, each time inside, there's another \"(\": 1+3(\n\nSo, the first layer is 3(1 + 3(...), then inside that, another (1 + 3(...), etc.\n\nLet me count the number of times \"(\" appears:\n\n1. 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n10. (1 + 3\n\nWait, but the innermost is (1 + 3), which is just 1 + 3 without another \"(\". So, actually, the number of \"(\" is 9. Because starting from the first after 3, there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, let me try again. The expression is 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)). Each time inside, another (1 + 3(...)). So, the first \"(\" is after the initial 3. Then, each subsequent \"(\" is inside the previous one.\n\nSo, the number of \"(\" is 9. Therefore, there are 9 layers. So, my initial calculation with 9 layers is correct. So, Layer 1 is innermost, Layer 9 is outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that's 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me write down each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, the pattern is a geometric progression, perhaps? Let me think about that.\n\nIn general, if we have a recursive formula like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then this is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nYes, for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula. In this case, k = 3 and c = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13, which matches Layer 2. Similarly, a_3 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40, which is Layer 3. So, indeed, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, Layer n is equal to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier. So, that confirms that Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the result. To make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for the entire expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nThis is a nested expression where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, it's a finite nested multiplication. The formula for such a nested expression can sometimes be expressed in terms of a geometric series or using the formula for a linear recurrence.\n\nGiven that, and since we've already computed each layer step by step and confirmed with the formula, I feel confident that the result is 88572.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure with 9 layers.\n2. Compute each layer from the innermost outward.\n3. Alternatively, use the formula for the linear recurrence to find the value of the 9th layer.\n4. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer, we find the value of the outermost layer and then multiply it by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let's see. The innermost part is 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but the original problem has the outermost 3 multiplied by this entire expression. So, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, after computing L9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. Let me verify each step again. Starting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let me compute 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost 3*(29524). Let me compute that again: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check once more because sometimes with so many layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use to compute this without expanding each layer, which might be faster and less error-prone. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous term. So, this looks similar to a geometric series, but it's built recursively. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value at the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier values to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula confirms the result I obtained by expanding each layer. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Each a_n is built as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this expansion, we'd get a sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} times a_1, but wait, that might not be exactly correct because a_1 is 4, which itself is 1 + 3*1. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, since I have a closed-form formula, perhaps it's better to stick with that. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By expanding each layer from the innermost outward, we find each layer's value and multiply by 3 at the end. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula, confirming the result. The final computation yields 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nSo, 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\n3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that. So, Layer 9 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 8). But Layer 8 was 9841. So, 3 times 9841 is... let me compute that.\n\n3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 800 is 2400, 3 times 40 is 120, and 3 times 1 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify that multiplication because that's a big number. Alternatively, I can compute 9841 * 3 directly:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12, carry over 1\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, carry over 2\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29.\n\nSo, writing it down: 29523. Then adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nLet's add 59048 + 29524.\n\nAdding units place: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the sum is 88572. Yep, that matches.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again just to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nLet me denote L(n) as the value of Layer n. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation: L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1.\n\nWait, no, actually, the nonhomogeneous part is the constant term 1. So, the homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution, L_p(n). Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution. Let's assume L_p(n) = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u2192 0 = 1 + 2A \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, that matches all the layers. So, using this formula, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524, which is exactly what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*L(9), and L(9)= (3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11} to check.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, (3^{11}-3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or find a closed-form expression, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost layer:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1} = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2} = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 3} = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 4} = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 5} = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 6} = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 7} = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 8} = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times \\text{Layer 9} = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nUsing the closed-form formula for the layers, we find that each layer \\(L(n)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ L(n) = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\n\nFor \\(n = 9\\):\n\n\\[ L(9) = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nThus, the entire expression is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThe value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems manageable. So, let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.

So I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check the number of layers again. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses, each adding another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is L1, and working up to L9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, yes, I think I did each layer correctly, so the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's a formulaic way to compute this without going through each layer, maybe using a geometric series or something.\n\nEach layer seems to be of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, subtract 3B from both sides:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation. So, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the steps are correct, and using the recurrence relation method also gives the same result, which reinforces that the answer is accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost layer \\( L_1 \\) and moving outward:\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ 29524 \\times 3 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(13). Let me compute that. 3 times 13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern forming here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and then adding 1. Let me write that down to make it clear. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say that each layer is a term a_n, where n is the number of layers. So, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the next layer is a_2 = 1 + 3(a_1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, a_3 = 1 + 3(a_2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait a second, that seems like a geometric progression or something similar. Let me check the values again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, is that right? 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Yes. a_5 = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Wait, but hold on, the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, does that mean we have nine layers? Let me count again. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, yes, the outermost layer is the ninth layer. So, the total expression is 3 times a_9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524 is... Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. So, the total expression is 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because it's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers. Let me compute a_9 again step by step. a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Yes, that's correct. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n to avoid computing each step manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about the recurrence relation here. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the recurrence into this form. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If a_n = A*3^{n} + B, then substituting into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's compute the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier values to make sure. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form expression, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. Since 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

    "text": " Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is the last one: (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the previous result. So, let me define each layer as follows: Let me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost. So, Level 1: (1 + 3) Level 2: 3*(Level 1) + 1? Wait, no, actually, looking back, each Level n is 1 + 3*(Level n+1). Hmm, maybe I should work from the inside out, starting with the innermost expression and moving outward, computing each layer step by step. So, let me start with the innermost parentheses: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another expression: 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving outward another layer, we have another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, the next layer is 40. Wait, but let me check: Is each layer 1 + 3*(previous layer), or is it 3*(1 + ...)? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look at the structure again. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving outward, each step is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Wait, maybe I should think of each layer as being computed as 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me try that. Let me define the layers from the inside out. Let's say:\n\n- Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go through each layer again to verify:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that with another method. 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n- 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000 \u2192 Total so far: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n- 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500 \u2192 Total: 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n- 20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 Total: 88500 + 60 = 88560\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 Total: 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of (1+3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...), and the outermost is 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) instances:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 times? Let me see: The expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, counting the number of 1+3 inside, it's 9 times. So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time adding another 1+3*(...). So, yes, 9 layers, each computed as above. So, the final result after computing Layer 9 is 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me try computing a smaller version to see if the pattern holds. Suppose I have only one layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nIf I have two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nIf I have three layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, if I have three layers, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(7)) = 3*(1 + 21) = 3*22 = 66. Wait, but according to my earlier method, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, then 3*40 = 120. Hmm, but in the two-layer case, according to my earlier step-by-step, Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39, which matches the manual computation. For three layers, according to my earlier steps, Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120, but when I compute it manually, I get 66. That's a discrepancy. Wait, that can't be right. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no, let me compute three layers manually again:\n\nThree layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost first: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out: 3*(4) = 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 3*(13) = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext layer: 3*(40) = 120. So, the entire expression is 120. Wait, but when I computed manually earlier, I thought it was 66, but that must have been a mistake.\n\nWait, let's do it step by step:\n\nThree layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nOutermost: 3*(40) = 120. Yes, that's correct. So, my earlier manual computation was wrong when I thought it was 66. So, the method is correct.\n\nSimilarly, let's check two layers:\n\nTwo layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\nOutermost: 3*(13) = 39. Correct.\n\nSo, my initial method is correct. Therefore, proceeding with 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each layer is a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, with a_9 being the innermost term. Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me try to model it as a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, with a_1 being the innermost.\n\nWait, but that's a bit confusing because usually, in recurrence relations, we express a_{n+1} in terms of a_n, but here it's the other way around. Maybe I can rearrange it.\n\nLet me think: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}.\n\nSo, solving for a_{n+1}: a_{n+1} = (a_n - 1)/3.\n\nWait, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as a linear recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to recognize the pattern as each a_n = (a_{n-1} - 1)/3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression as a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me consider the layers again. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express this as a_n = (a_{n-1} - 1)/3, but that seems inverted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}.\n\nBut this seems a bit tricky because each term depends on the next term. Maybe I can reverse the order. Let me consider the layers from the outermost to the innermost. Let me define a_0 as the outermost expression, which is 3*(a_1), where a_1 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, until a_9 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, that might be more manageable. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define:\n\na_9 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is a_0 = 3*a_1 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find a pattern in the numbers I obtained:\n\na_9 = 4\n\na_8 = 13\n\na_7 = 40\n\na_6 = 121\n\na_5 = 364\n\na_4 = 1093\n\na_3 = 3280\n\na_2 = 9841\n\na_1 = 29524\n\nI can try to see if these numbers follow a geometric progression or some other pattern.\n\nLooking at the ratios between consecutive terms:\n\na_8 / a_9 = 13 / 4 = 3.25\n\na_7 / a_8 = 40 / 13 \u2248 3.077\n\na_6 / a_7 = 121 / 40 = 3.025\n\na_5 / a_6 = 364 / 121 \u2248 3.008\n\na_4 / a_5 = 1093 / 364 \u2248 3.000\n\na_3 / a_4 = 3280 / 1093 \u2248 3.000\n\na_2 / a_3 = 9841 / 3280 \u2248 3.000\n\na_1 / a_2 = 29524 / 9841 \u2248 3.000\n\nSo, starting from a_5 onwards, each term is approximately 3 times the previous term. That suggests that after a certain point, the terms are following a geometric progression with ratio 3. Let me check if this is the case.\n\nIf a_n = 3*a_{n+1} + 1, but wait, no, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}.\n\nWait, let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}. So, rearranged, a_{n+1} = (a_n - 1)/3.\n\nWait, that's a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is:\n\na_{n+1} = (a_n - 1)/3.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. Let me find the homogeneous solution first.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = (1/3)*a_n.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r = 1/3, so the homogeneous solution is A*(1/3)^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (-1/3), let's assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p = (a_p - 1)/3\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n3*a_p = a_p - 1\n\nSubtract a_p from both sides:\n\n2*a_p = -1\n\nSo, a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = homogeneous + particular = A*(1/3)^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Wait, but in our case, we have a_9 = 4. Let me use n=9 for the initial condition.\n\nSo, when n=9, a_9 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*(1/3)^9 + (-1/2).\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA*(1/3)^9 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nSo, A = (9/2) / (1/3)^9 = (9/2) * 3^9.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, A = (9/2) * 19683 = (9*19683)/2.\n\nCompute 9*19683: 19683*9.\n\nCompute 20000*9 = 180000\n\nMinus 317*9 = 2853\n\nSo, 180000 - 2853 = 177147.\n\nSo, A = 177147 / 2 = 88573.5.\n\nWait, that seems off because our a_n values are integers. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used a different particular solution. Let me check the recurrence again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_{n+1} = (a_n - 1)/3.\n\nAlternatively, I can write it as a_{n} = (a_{n-1} - 1)/3.\n\nWait, maybe I should index it differently. Let me let n go from 1 to 9, with a_1 = 4, a_2 =13, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps using the general solution, I can express a_n as A*(1/3)^n + C, where C is a constant.\n\nWait, but when I applied the initial condition, I got a non-integer, which is confusing because all a_n are integers. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the particular solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to recognize that the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1} can be rewritten as a_{n+1} = (a_n - 1)/3.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and the solution should be of the form a_n = A*(1/3)^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find D, set a_n = D, so D = (D - 1)/3.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3: 3D = D - 1\n\nSubtract D: 2D = -1 \u2192 D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*(1/3)^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition at n=9: a_9 =4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*(1/3)^9 - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = A*(1/3)^9 \u2192 9/2 = A*(1/3)^9.\n\nSolving for A: A = (9/2) * 3^9 = (9/2)*19683 = (9*19683)/2 = 177147/2 = 88573.5.\n\nHmm, so A is 88573.5, which is a fraction. But our a_n values are all integers. This suggests that perhaps the general solution is correct, but when n decreases, the term A*(1/3)^n becomes negligible, but in our case, n starts at 9 and goes down to 1. Wait, perhaps I should be using n as increasing instead of decreasing.\n\nWait, maybe I should index the layers differently. Let me consider n as the layer number from the outermost to the innermost. So, a_1 is the outermost, which is 3*(1 + 3*a_2), and a_9 is the innermost, which is 4.\n\nWait, in that case, the recurrence would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, with a_9 =4.\n\nSo, solving for a_8, a_7, etc., up to a_1.\n\nIn this case, the general solution would still be a_n = A*(1/3)^n + D.\n\nBut when n=9, a_9=4, so 4 = A*(1/3)^9 + D.\n\nWe can also consider the limit as n approaches infinity, but in our case, n only goes up to 9, so maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation since the number of layers is manageable.\n\nGiven that, and having verified the computations for the first few layers, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer's result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13.\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40.\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121.\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364.\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093.\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280.\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841.\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's try that. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1, then the next one out is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9. But wait, looking at the expression, each Layer n is of the form 1 + 3*(Layer n+1). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9, which is just 1 + 3, since there are no more parentheses beyond that. Let me confirm that. The innermost part is (1 + 3), right? So, Layer 9 is 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 8 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 8 is 13. Then Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13: that's 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 7 is 40. Hmm, this seems manageable. Let me keep going. Layer 6 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 6 is 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1092 + 1 is 1093. So Layer 4 is 1093. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 3279 + 1 = 3280. So Layer 3 is 3280. Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 9840 + 1 = 9841. So Layer 2 is 9841. Finally, Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 841*3 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 1 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1), right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, the total value is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, and 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the total value is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, right. Layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, that's right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, yes. Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, that's right. Then the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Let me just verify one of the middle layers again to be sure. Let's take Layer 4: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is indeed 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. And Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute this another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572.

Let me denote each layer as follows: Let me number the layers from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). That seems manageable. Let me start computing each layer step by step. Let me write this down systematically. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each layer is getting bigger. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, moving on. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first. 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, and 3*1 is 3, so 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Wait, actually, maybe it's easier to compute 3*29524 directly. Let me do that. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3 is 27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me write it down step by step:\n\n  29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct up to Layer 9. Then, 3\u00d729524 is indeed 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Sometimes when I do these step-by-step computations, I might have made an arithmetic error somewhere. Let me check a couple of the layers again to be sure.\n\nLet me check Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121. 3\u00d7121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364. 3\u00d7364: 3\u00d7300=900, 3\u00d760=180, 3\u00d74=12. Total: 900+180=1080+12=1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093. 3\u00d71093: 3\u00d71000=3000, 3\u00d790=270, 3\u00d73=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280. 3\u00d73280: 3\u00d73000=9000, 3\u00d7200=600, 3\u00d780=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841. 3\u00d79841: 3\u00d79000=27000, 3\u00d7800=2400, 3\u00d740=120, 3\u00d71=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, 3\u00d729524=88572. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r=3 and c=1 here.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = r^{n} * (a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, let me check that.\n\nActually, the standard solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nBut in our case, a_1 = 4, and each subsequent a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, perhaps it's better to model it as starting from n=1.\n\nAlternatively, let me index it from n=0 for easier application of the formula.\n\nLet me set n=0: a_0 = 1 + 3*a_{-1}, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the recurrence starts at n=1, with a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each layer is a term in the sequence where a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as we computed earlier.\n\nSo, the general formula for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nBut in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, so perhaps I can write it as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, for n >= 2, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 being 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since I was able to compute it both by expanding each layer and by using the formula, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a formula for the linear recurrence relation, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward, leading to the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Compute the final expression**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to identify the innermost parentheses. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, if I let each layer be a variable, maybe I can define it recursively. Let me try that. Let's define:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n where n is the number of layers from the inside out. So, starting from the innermost:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. The original expression has nine layers, right? So, starting from a_1 as the innermost, each a_n is built upon the previous one. But when I count the layers, I see that each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*a_previous. So, I think I have nine layers in total, which would mean that a_9 is the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3. Let me check that. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is 1 + 3*a_8, and so on until a_1. So, if I compute each a_n up to a_9, then multiply by 3, that should give me the result. Let me make a table to keep track:\n\nn | a_n\n---|---\n1 | 4\n2 | 13\n3 | 40\n4 | 121\n5 | 364\n6 | 1093\n7 | 3280\n8 | 9841\n9 | 29524\n\nSo, according to this, a_9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me do the multiplication step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524\n*    3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations for each a_n to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake somewhere. Starting from a_1:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, a_6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, a_7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, a_8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, a_9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each a_n is correct up to a_9. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each term step by step. Let me think about that. Each a_n is defined by a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. It's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nAt n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I have:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSame result. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each step manually, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form expression, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula corroborates the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). Using a recursive approach or a closed-form formula, we find the result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me start by identifying the innermost expression. The very last part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let's compute that first. So, (1 + 3) is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the previous result was 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, that layer is 40. Hmm, okay, so each time I go out a layer, I'm multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Now, wait a second. The original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, after computing all nine layers, the innermost expression becomes 29524, and then we have to multiply that by 3. Let me confirm that. So, starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, the entire nested part simplifies to 29524. Now, the original expression is 3 multiplied by this, so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me do the multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together, it's 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, 5 with a carryover of 1. 9*3=27+1=28, 8 with a carryover of 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, yes, that gives 88572. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers because I might have miscounted. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), and each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of ( after the first one: 1. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time I see a ( after the first, it's a new layer. Let me count: 1. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) 2. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) 3. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) 4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) 5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) 6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) 7. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) 8. (1+3(1+3)) 9. (1+3) So, that's 9 layers. So, my initial calculation was correct, 9 layers, resulting in 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but when I did the layers, I got up to layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3. Let me confirm each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Let's break down 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 can be broken into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nMultiply each by 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*previous. So, for layer n, it's 1 + 3*(layer n-1). So, if I denote a_n as the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, a_1 was 4, a_2 was 13, etc., up to a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write this as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my earlier calculation. So, a_9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3^{10} again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations in the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple times, both by expanding each layer step by step and by using the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation. Both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed and then used in the next layer. After computing all nine layers, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).\n\n2. **Compute from the innermost layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3**: The entire nested expression equals 29524. Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9. So, Level 1 is the innermost: (1 + 3). Then Level 2 is 3*(Level 1), and so on. Wait, no. Wait, actually, each Level is 1 + 3*(next Level). So, Level 1 is (1 + 3), Level 2 is 1 + 3*(Level 1), Level 3 is 1 + 3*(Level 2), etc. So, I need to compute each Level starting from Level 1 up to Level 9, and then multiply by 3 at the end? Wait, no, because the entire expression is 3*(...), so the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, perhaps I should compute the nested expression first, then multiply by 3. Let me try to structure this. Let's define each Level as follows: Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) ... up to Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) Then the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, I can compute Level 1 through Level 9 step by step.

Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3*(Level 9) = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify each Level again to ensure I didn't make an error. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

But wait, in the original problem, each layer is multiplied by 3, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the end. So actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my approach. Let me clarify: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So each layer is 3*(1 + next layer).

In the original problem, each layer is multiplied by 3, so the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.

The original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...).

So, there are 9 layers, each adding another 3*(...).\n\nSo, my initial computation of 9 layers is correct. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that because when I computed Layer 1 as 4, Layer 2 as 13, etc., up to Layer 9 as 29524, that seems correct.

Then, multiplying by 3 at the end: 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the multiplication because 29524*3 is 88572. Let me compute it another way to confirm:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I feel like this might not be the correct approach. Let me think again. Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1}=0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A =1 \u2192 A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{n} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers. Wait, no, because L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the total expression is 3*L_n=3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2= (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nIn this case, n=9 layers, so the total expression is (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, it's 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Wait, actually, the innermost is the last one, which is 1 + 3, right? So maybe I should start there. Let me write down each layer step by step. Let me try to parse the expression step by step. The innermost part is 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result.

So, if I compute each Layer from 1 to 9, I can substitute each result into the next layer. Let me try that. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Therefore, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27,000, 3*800 is 2,400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So, adding those up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Therefore, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 3*20,000 is 60,000; 3*9,000 is 27,000; 3*500 is 1,500; 3*24 is 72. So, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29,524. Let me compute that again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3 = 60,000; 9,000*3 = 27,000; 500*3 = 1,500; 24*3 = 72. Adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that seems correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final result of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " Let's see. The innermost part is 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer is 40. Hmm, I'm noticing that each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. Let me see if this pattern continues. So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, that's 121. Continuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*(121). Calculating that: 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. So, 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let's do that: 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Hmm, 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute: 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, that's 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me calculate 3*3280. Well, 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. That's a big number, 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that's 29524. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute 3*29524. Hmm, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. That's 88573. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(88573). Let me calculate that. 3*88573. Let's break it down: 3*80000 = 240000, 3*8000 = 24000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*70 = 210, and 3*3 = 9. Now, adding all those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 = 265719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265719. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, 1+3*13=40, 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524, 1+3*29524=88573, and finally 3*88573=265719. Each step seems correct, so I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner expression. Repeating this process for each layer, the final result is 265,719.\n\n$\\boxed{265719}$"

    "text": " Let's define each layer as a function of the next. Let me assign variables to each level to make it clearer. Let's say the innermost part is A, then the next one is B, and so on up to the outermost one. So, starting from the innermost: A = 1 + 3 Then, the next layer out would be B = 1 + 3*A, then the next one C = 1 + 3*B, and so on, until I get to the outermost layer, which would be multiplied by 3. Let me try that approach. So, starting with A: A = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, B = 1 + 3*A. Since A is 4, that becomes B = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so B is 13. Next layer out, C = 1 + 3*B. Substituting B, we get C = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost layer (A): 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer (B): 1 + 3*A = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next layer (C): 1 + 3*B = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next layer (D): 1 + 3*C = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next layer (E): 1 + 3*D = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next layer (F): 1 + 3*E = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer (G): 1 + 3*F = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8.

Let me check that again because I might have miscounted the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let me recount:\n\n1. A = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. B = 1 + 3*A = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. C = 1 + 3*B = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. D = 1 + 3*C = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. E = 1 + 3*D = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. F = 1 + 3*E = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. G = 1 + 3*F = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. H = 1 + 3*G = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. I = 1 + 3*H = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times the first layer, which is 1 + 3*(...). So, after computing I, which is the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3*I. Let me confirm that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. So, if I is the result of the inner expression up to the ninth layer, then the final result is 3*I. So, I = 29524, so the total is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n----------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\nThen, the next digit is 2 (from 29,524) which is the ten-thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but 29,524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute it another way to confirm.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n= (30,000 - 476) \u00d7 3\n\n= 90,000 - 1,428\n\n= 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing I, which was the outermost layer before multiplying by 3. Let me go back through each step to check.\n\n1. A = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. B = 1 + 3*A = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. C = 1 + 3*B = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. D = 1 + 3*C = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. E = 1 + 3*D = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. F = 1 + 3*E = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\n7. G = 1 + 3*F = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\n8. H = 1 + 3*G = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\n9. I = 1 + 3*H = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems correct. Therefore, I is indeed 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the first layer is 1 + 3*(...), and that's multiplied by 3. So, when I computed I as 29,524, that's the value inside the first set of parentheses, and then I multiplied by 3 to get the final answer. So, yes, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nwith a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have nine layers, so maybe n goes from 1 to 9, with a_1 being the innermost. Wait, no, actually, in our initial approach, A was the innermost, which would correspond to a_1, then B is a_2, up to a_9 being the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, the general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe I can solve it more directly.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, which is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3, n would be 9. So,\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value we got earlier. So, the outermost layer before multiplying by 3 is 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more using the formula. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here because each term is nested, not a sum of separate terms. But let's see.\n\nWait, another approach: Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, then each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nSo, if I have n layers, the nth term would be 1 + 3*(n-1)th term. So, for n=1, term is 4, as we saw.\n\nBut using the formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's 29524. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step. Using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, we find the outermost layer before multiplying by 3. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's label each layer for clarity. Let me define each nested expression as a variable. Let me see: Let me define the innermost expression as A. Then moving outward, each expression will be built using the previous one. Let me try to define it step by step. Let's start with the innermost part: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(previous expression). Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me write down each step.\n\nFirst, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result from the innermost)). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out, it's again 1 + 3*(previous result). So that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13: 3*10 is 30, 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me check that again. So, the second layer was 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(13). 3*13 is indeed 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. That seems correct.\n\nMoving outward another layer, we have 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute 3*40 first: that's 120. Then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121). Let's compute 3*121. Hmm, 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nAnother layer out: 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, that seems like a big number, but let's continue. The next layer is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer, which is 1 + 3*(88573). Let's compute 3*88573. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding these up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems way too large. Let me check if I'm doing this correctly. Maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the number of opening parentheses to make sure I'm not going too far.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. So starting from the first 3, each subsequent 1+ is a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n10. ...1+3))))) \n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me think again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me see how many layers there are.\n\nEach time we have a 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, in total, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, so maybe I need to compute 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), and then multiply the final result by 3. So, let me structure this properly.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLayer 1: L1 = 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nLayer 3: L3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nLayer 9: L9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen the final result is 3*L9.\n\nSo, starting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I thought I was getting up to 265720, which was way too high. But now, by carefully counting each layer, I get 88572. That seems more reasonable. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal result: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried to compute each layer without labeling them, I went up to 265720, which was incorrect. It seems I miscounted the layers before. By labeling each layer from L1 to L9, I can ensure that I compute each step correctly without missing any layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general form of a linear recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^n * L_0 + (b/(a - 1))*(a^n - 1). Wait, let me recall the exact formula.\n\nFor a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the closed-form solution is:\n\nL_n = a^n * L_0 + (b/(a - 1))*(a^n - 1)\n\nBut in our case, L1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. Let me check if this formula applies.\n\nWait, actually, in our case, L1 = 4, which is the first term. So, perhaps L0 would be undefined in this context, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*a^n, and the particular solution is L_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a)\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + K.\n\nUsing the initial condition, say L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*a^1 + K => 4 = C*3 + K\n\nWe know that K = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2\n\nSo, 4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nL4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\nL5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\nL6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\nL7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\nL8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147\n\nThen, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've computed it step by step, checked each layer, derived a formula, and confirmed it with the formula. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we can simplify the expression step by step.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - Final result: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nTherefore, the computed value of the expression is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
