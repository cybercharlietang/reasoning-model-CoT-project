    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer from the inside out to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then Layer 2 wraps around that, and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost part. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (but wait, in the innermost part, it's just 1 + 3, right? Because there's nothing beyond that. Let me check. The innermost part is 1 + 3, because the next layer is 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)), but since the innermost one doesn't have any more layers, it's just 1 + 3. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me do Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down again. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Let me go back through each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. 1092 +1=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. 3279+1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. 9840+1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. 27000+2400=29400, +123=29523. 29523+1=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. Yes, that seems correct.

    "text": " Let me try to parse this step by step. Starting from the innermost part: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving out one layer, it's 3 times that result, plus 1. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps I can represent each layer as a function or as a recursive expression. Let me think of it as a sequence. Let's define each layer as a term in a sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote the innermost expression as a starting point and work my way out. Let's start by numbering the layers from the inside out. So, layer 1 is (1 + 3). Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2). And so on, up to layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, when I look at the original expression, the outermost term is 3*(...), so maybe I need to consider that as well. Let me count the number of layers. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer, so starting from the innermost: 1. (1 + 3) 2. 1 + 3*(result of 1) 3. 1 + 3*(result of 2) 4. 1 + 3*(result of 3) 5. 1 + 3*(result of 4) 6. 1 + 3*(result of 5) 7. 1 + 3*(result of 6) 8. 1 + 3*(result of 7) 9. 1 + 3*(result of 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(result of 9). So, there are nine layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from layer 1 up to layer 9, and then multiply the final result by 3. Let me write this down as a sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me define a sequence {a_n} where n goes from 1 to 9, and a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Finally, the total expression is 3*a_9. That seems manageable. Let me compute each a_n step by step. Starting with a_1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, a_2 = 13. Next, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, a_3 = 40. Moving on to a_4: 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Therefore, a_4 = 121. Now, a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121: let me compute that. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, a_5 = 364. Next, a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. 300*3 = 900, 60*3 = 180, 4*3 = 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Therefore, a_6 = 1093. Now, a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, a_7 = 3280. Moving on to a_8: 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 = 9000, 200*3 = 600, 80*3 = 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, a_8 = 9841. Finally, a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, a_9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from the innermost layer: a_1 = 4, correct. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: let me verify this multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. It took a while to compute each layer, but by breaking it down step by step and computing each a_n sequentially, I was able to avoid getting lost in the nested parentheses. It's interesting how each layer builds on the previous one, tripling the result and adding 1 each time. It almost feels like a geometric progression, but with an added constant each time. I wonder if there's a formula for such a sequence, but since there are only nine layers, computing each one step by step was manageable. If the number of layers were much larger, I might look for a pattern or a formula to compute it more efficiently, but for nine layers, this step-by-step approach worked fine. I also had to be careful with the multiplication, especially with the larger numbers, to avoid any arithmetic errors. It's easy to miscompute a step when dealing with numbers in the thousands, so taking it one step at a time and double-checking each multiplication helped ensure accuracy. All in all, methodically working through each layer and keeping track of each step was key to solving this problem without getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the nested expressions.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers, each consisting of 1 plus 3 times the next innermost layer.

    "text": " That should simplify things step by step. Let me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). So, let me compute that first. Compute (1 + 3): 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, now the next layer is 40. Continuing this way, each time I take the previous result, multiply by 3, add 1, and that becomes the new result. Let me try to write down each step to keep track:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each step is one layer. Let me list them:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression has nine layers, so after computing Layer 9, we still have the outermost multiplication by 3. Let me make sure. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply by 3.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n24*3 = 72\n\nWait, no, that's breaking it down incorrectly. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\ntimes 3\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nNext: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the layers again because I'm a bit confused about how many layers there are. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times ...))) So, when I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time I was going one layer out, and after Layer 9, I multiplied by 3. So, yes, that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, more formally, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, is there a pattern or formula for a_n? Let me see if I can find a recurrence relation. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^{n} + B\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSet equal:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for a_9, that would be (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. To make sure, let me try computing a few layers manually again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the recurrence.\n\nCompute a_1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which is correct.\n\nSo, everything checks out. I think I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives a_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer from the inside out. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, with the outermost being Layer 9. Wait, actually, maybe it's the other way around. The innermost is the last one, so maybe I should label them from Layer 1 (innermost) to Layer 9 (outermost). Let me try that. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). And so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost part. Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me write down each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me verify 3*364: 300*3=900, 64*3=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1092 + 1 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. 3279 + 1 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. 9840 + 1 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me do it another way to verify. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's consistent. So I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow a recursive formula: each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution can be found using the method for such recursions. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The general solution is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's apply that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result without computing each layer step by step. That's a good way to confirm my answer. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern immediately, I could have noticed that each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, starting from the inside, each layer is 1 + 3*(the next layer). So, working from the inside out, each time I compute a layer, it's 1 + 3*(the result of the next layer). Therefore, I can compute each layer step by step as I did before, which is what I did initially. Either way, whether by step-by-step computation or by finding a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. So, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me start by identifying the innermost part. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? Because that's the very last part before the first closing parenthesis. So, let's compute that first. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result of the innermost layer. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the second innermost layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so the third layer is 40. Next, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. So, the fourth layer is 121. Continuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*(121). Calculating that: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. The fifth layer is 364. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(364). Let me do that: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Sixth layer is 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Calculating: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Seventh layer is 3280. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute that: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Eighth layer is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me calculate that: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, the ninth layer is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times this result, right? Because the whole thing is multiplied by 3. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29524. Hmm, let me break that down. 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to get lost in all these layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then, 1+3*4=13. Then, 1+3*13=40. Then, 1+3*40=121. Then, 1+3*121=364. Then, 1+3*364=1093. Then, 1+3*1093=3280. Then, 1+3*3280=9841. Then, 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Each step seems to follow correctly. Alternatively, I could try to find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I did earlier. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer manually. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. Plugging the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. On the other hand, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + B. Therefore, equating the two expressions: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see, starting from the innermost as layer 1, up to layer 9, and then multiplied by 3. So, the innermost layer is layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches our earlier computation. Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13, which also matches. So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which is exactly what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods, computing each layer step by step and finding a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses. By either iteratively computing each layer or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, the result is found to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, actually, the outermost layer is 3*(...), so maybe it's 10 layers in total? Let me check. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))), and counting the opening parentheses, I see there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + d, where d is a constant particular solution. Let me find d. Setting L_n = d, then d = 3*d + 1. Solving for d: d = 3d + 1 \u2192 -2d = 1 \u2192 d = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Same result. So, that's another way to look at it. Instead of computing each layer, I could recognize the pattern and use the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, then compute the final result. That's a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers manually to see if the pattern holds. Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nYes, each time, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, 4*3 +1=13, 13*3 +1=40, 40*3 +1=121, etc. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost layer and recognizing a recurrence pattern, we can efficiently compute the result. Each layer follows the form \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\), leading to a formula for the nth layer. Applying this, we find the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to simplify this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's easy, right? 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that innermost part. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next expression is 1 + 3 times 40. That would be 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, this layer is 121.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3 times 121. Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives 364. So, this layer simplifies to 364.\n\nNext, the expression becomes 1 + 3*364. Calculating that: 3*364 is 1092, and adding 1 gives 1093. So, now we're at 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*1093. Let me figure that out: 3*1093 is 3279, and adding 1 gives 3280. So, this layer is 3280.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute that: 3*3280 is 9840, and adding 1 gives 9841. So, now we have 9841.\n\nNext, the expression is 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate that: 3*9841 is 29523, and adding 1 gives 29524. So, this layer simplifies to 29524.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 is 88572, and adding 1 gives 88573. So, now we're at 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 times that result. So, 3*88573. Let me calculate that: 88573 times 3. Breaking it down, 80,000*3 is 240,000, 8,000*3 is 24,000, 500*3 is 1,500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 is 264,000. 264,000 + 1,500 is 265,500. 265,500 + 210 is 265,710. 265,710 + 9 is 265,719. So, 3*88573 equals 265,719.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 88573 * 3:\n\n- 3 * 3 is 9\n- 3 * 7 is 21, carry over 2\n- 3 * 5 is 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, carry over 1\n- 3 * 8 is 24, plus the carried 1 is 25, carry over 2\n- 3 * 8 is 24, plus the carried 2 is 26\n\nSo, writing it down: 265,719. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer simplifies as follows:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nSo, the final result is 265,719. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors, especially in the multiplication steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n11. 3*88573 = 265,719 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll the steps check out, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer simplifies to a number that's used in the next layer.

    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's denote each innermost expression as E1, then moving outward as E2, E3, up to E9. So, E1 is the innermost part: 1 + 3. Then E2 would be 1 + 3*E1, E3 is 1 + 3*E2, and so on, until E9, which is the outermost expression. Then the entire problem is 3*E9. Wait, actually, looking back, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)), so maybe the innermost is E1 = 1 + 3, then E2 = 1 + 3*E1, and so on, with the outermost being E9, and the final result is 3*E9. Hmm, maybe I should just compute each layer step by step without assigning E1 to E9. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2.

Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a multiplication error here.\n\nStarting over, step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Right.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 20000*3=60000\n- 9000*3=27000\n- 500*3=1500\n- 20*3=60\n- 4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up step by step:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait a second, that seems like a lot, but each step checks out. Let me just make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses inside the outer 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I computed each layer up to the ninth, and then multiplied by 3. That should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer, and it's repeated multiple times, perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about that. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(next layer). If I denote the nth layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, rewrite the recurrence as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, each layer a_n can be computed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers. So, the innermost layer is a_1, then a_2, up to a_9.\n\nWait, let me confirm: when n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches our earlier computation. Good.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the ninth layer a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our step-by-step computation earlier. That's reassuring.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the closed-form approach.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Solving this, we found a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Plugging in n=9 gives a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, step-by-step computation also led to 88572, so both methods concur. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me recompute a_9 using the formula:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let's compute:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. 29524*3=88572.\n\nAlright, so after carefully computing each step and verifying with a different method, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe can break down the computation as follows:\n\n1.

Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 2). That's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern forming. Let me keep going to see if this continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364.

Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but actually, let me do it step by step. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right, 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 plus 1 is 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 plus 2 is 8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 plus 2 is 8. 0*3=0. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 more carefully. 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me confirm using another method. Alternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3 can be computed as (29000 + 524) \u00d7 3 = 29000\u00d73 + 524\u00d73. 29000\u00d73 = 87000. 524\u00d73: 500\u00d73=1500, 24\u00d73=72. So 1500 + 72 = 1572. Then, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check Layer 9. 3\u00d79841: 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524: 29524 \u00d73. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7\n\n9\u00d73=27 \u21927, carryover 2\n\n5\u00d73=15 +2=17 \u21927, carryover 1\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7\n\nSo writing it down: 7 8 7 2 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I misaligned the digits.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n\n\u00d7          3\n\n------------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo the result is 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, but that's only 5 digits. The original number is 29524, which is 5 digits, so multiplying by 3 gives 88572, which is 5 digits as well. So the result is 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nLet me just verify one more time by computing each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 +3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 +3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, I think I've double-checked each step and didn't find any errors. So the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each step as follows:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:  \n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's denote each innermost expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost and E9 is the outermost. So, E1 = 1 + 3. Then E2 = 1 + 3(E1). E3 = 1 + 3(E2), and so on, until E9. After computing E9, the entire expression would be 3(E9). Let me write this out step by step. Starting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving outward to E2: E2 = 1 + 3(E1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so E2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so E2 is 13. Now, E3: E3 = 1 + 3(E2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so E3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so E3 is 40. Next, E4: E4 = 1 + 3(E3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so E4 = 1 + 120 = 121. E4 is 121. Moving on to E5: E5 = 1 + 3(E4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. So, E5 = 1 + 363 = 364. E5 is 364. Now, E6: E6 = 1 + 3(E5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E6 is 1093. Next up is E7: E7 = 1 + 3(E6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093. Let's break it down: 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E7 is 3280. Now, E8: E8 = 1 + 3(E7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 = 9000, 200*3 = 600, 80*3 = 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E8 is 9841. Finally, E9: E9 = 1 + 3(E8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. E9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times E9, so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total expression equals 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from E1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. E2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. E3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. E4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. E5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. E6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. E7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. E8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. E9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then 3*29524: Let me do this multiplication again to confirm. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me this result without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general form is E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b. In this case, a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is E_n = a^{n} * E0 + (a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1) * b, where E0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, E1 is the first term. Let me adjust that. Let me consider E1 = 4, E2 = 1 + 3*E1, and so on. So, it's a recurrence of the form E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, with E1 = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution E_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition E1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few terms. For n=1: E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which is correct. For n=3: E3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, E9 is when n=9. So, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the recurrence relation method, I also arrive at the same answer. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I think I've solved the problem correctly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation method give the same answer. So, I'm pretty sure the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer from the inside out. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, with the outermost being Layer 9. But wait, actually, the expression starts with 3 times (1 + 3 times something). So maybe I should start evaluating from the innermost Layer 1 and work my way outwards. Let me try that. Let's define each layer as follows: Layer 1: 1 + 3 (this is the innermost part) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems manageable. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can find Layer 9 and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Let me start computing each layer one by one. Let's write down each step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. So Layer 1 is 4. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first, which is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 364*3. Let me do that step by step. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me just verify 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So writing it out: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Let me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, the innermost expression is (1 + 3) which is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). Since the previous result was 4, this becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so that layer gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). The previous result was 13, so this is (1 + 3*13). Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, so now I have 40 for this layer. Let me continue this process step by step, each time taking the previous result and plugging it into the next outer layer. Let me list out each step to keep track:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Each time I'm computing the innermost expression and moving outward, right? Let me recount to ensure I haven't missed a layer or miscalculated. Let me write down each step clearly:\n\n1. Start with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original problem has nine layers of parentheses, right? Let me check: Starting from the innermost, each time I compute a layer, I move one step out. So after computing nine layers, I should have the total value. But when I look at the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(...), and each time I compute one layer, I get a new value. So after nine layers, I should have the final value inside the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3. Wait, but in my steps above, after nine layers, I have 29524. But is that the value inside the outermost parentheses? Let me check the structure again. The original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the outermost operation is 3*(...). The innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, when I compute each layer, starting from the innermost, each result is the value of that layer's expression. So, after nine layers, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then I need to multiply that by 3. Wait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to 29524, which would be the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo yes, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps again because I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount the number of layers to make sure I didn't miss any or count extra. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count how many times (1+3 appears:\n\n1. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 1\n2. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 2\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 3\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2192 4\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 5\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 6\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 7\n8. (1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 8\n9. (1+3)))))) \u2192 9\n\nSo, there are nine layers of (1+3(...)). Therefore, I did compute nine layers correctly. So, the innermost layer gives 4, then each subsequent layer up to the ninth gives 29524, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Let me recompute each layer step by step to verify.\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Each step seems accurate. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, especially with similar structures, it's easy to miscount the layers or misapply the operations. Let me try a different approach to verify my answer. Maybe I can represent this as a recursive formula.\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with the base case f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, for n layers, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1).\n\nLet me compute f(n) for n = 1 to 9.\n\nf(1) = 4\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, f(9) = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let me think about it. The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nf(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1)\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\nSimplify the right side:\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n-2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\nf(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nf(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: f(3) = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, n=9, so f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. Since f(n) is the value inside the nth layer, and the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, so yes, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*f(9), where f(9) = 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2 with a carryover of 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925 with carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928 with carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add them:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nLet me add step by step:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nBut just to make absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n3. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n4.Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n5.Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n6.Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n7.Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n8.Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n9.Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer correctly builds up to 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing all nine layers, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. We then multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me start from the innermost part and work my way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that innermost part. Wait, no, actually, it's 1 + 3 times the next inner expression. Wait, let me make sure I'm getting this right. The innermost parentheses is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(innermost). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer is 40. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me test that. So, if I have a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, then f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). But wait, in this case, each layer is a separate multiplication, so maybe I can model this as a recursive function. Alternatively, since I'm dealing with a finite number of layers, I can compute each one step by step. Let me see how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which I called layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.

So, after computing layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me check that. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.

The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is the 9th layer, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses: each \"1 + 3(\" adds one. So, starting from the first after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses. So, each layer corresponds to one of these, so layer 1 is the innermost, layer 9 is the outermost before the final 3. So, yes, layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake in any layer. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*120 = 360, plus 3*1 = 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364.

Let's break it down:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 layer 1\n\n2. (1 + 3*(layer 1)) \u2192 layer 2\n\n3. (1 + 3*(layer 2)) \u2192 layer 3\n\n4. (1 + 3*(layer 3)) \u2192 layer 4\n\n5. (1 + 3*(layer 4)) \u2192 layer 5\n\n6. (1 + 3*(layer 5)) \u2192 layer 6\n\n7. (1 + 3*(layer 6)) \u2192 layer 7\n\n8. (1 + 3*(layer 7)) \u2192 layer 8\n\n9. (1 + 3*(layer 8)) \u2192 layer 9\n\nSo, yes, layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, my earlier calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could model this as a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's find B. Setting a_n = B, then B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B = 1 + 3B \u2192 0 = 1 + 2B \u2192 B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 + 1/2 = 3A \u2192 9/2 = 3A \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, and 3^10 is 59049. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, a_9 is (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach. Each term in the layers can be expanded as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nIf I expand a_9, it would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*(1 + 3)...))).\n\nExpanding this, each 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. So, for a_9, it would be:\n\n1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1.\n\nWait, because each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer out adds another 3. So, for a_9, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*1)).\n\nBut when expanded, it's 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. Wait, but that can't be right because the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, not 1 + 3^1. Wait, maybe I need to adjust for that. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I expand a_9, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3)...)). So, each time, you're adding another 3. So, the expansion would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... +3^9. But that's a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^9. The sum of such a series is (3^{10} -1)/(3 -1) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier result. Therefore, a_9 is indeed 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. If I have a_9 =1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)), then when expanded, it's 1 +3 +3^2 +...+3^9. So, the sum is from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) =3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the expansion. Because each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer), so when you expand it all, you get 1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^9. So, that's 10 terms, from 3^0 to 3^9. The sum is indeed (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it, which confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this as a base-3 number or something, but I think the methods I've used so far are sufficient.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer step by step again, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1 +12=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could write a small program or use a calculator to compute each step, but since I'm doing this manually, I have to be careful.\n\nWait, another thought: the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th term in the sequence defined by a_n=1+3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, using the formula we derived earlier, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. The innermost expression is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Moving outward, each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result of the previous layer)}\\).\n\nLet's compute each layer step by step:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then \\(3 \\times 29524\\):\n\n- \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3). So, let me compute that first. Let me number each layer from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9, where Layer 1 is the innermost. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60=360, 360+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Now, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Now, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, remember that the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the entire expression simplifies to 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them all together: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but by breaking it down step by step, it became manageable. Each layer just required multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, then moving outward until I reached the outermost layer and then multiplied by 3 one last time. It's interesting how these nested expressions can be solved methodically by starting from the inside and working outwards. I guess the key here was recognizing the repetitive pattern and handling each layer one at a time without getting overwhelmed by the entire expression. It's a good reminder that even complex-looking problems can often be simplified by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer until the outermost expression is reached, which is then multiplied by 3 to obtain the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Layer by Layer**:\n   - **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3. **Compute the Final Expression**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - Final Result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to label each layer to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which would be the outermost part. Then the entire expression would be 3*(Layer 9). Okay, so starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple, 1 + 3 equals 4. So Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let's compute that. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an error when dealing with large numbers. Let's go through the layers again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.

So:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nWait, but actually, looking back at the original expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and then build up each layer until I reach the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let's define each layer:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n...\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, maybe L1 is the innermost 1 + 3, then L2 is 1 + 3*L1, etc., up to L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost is 3*(something), so yes, it's 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*L8.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 29,524.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 =7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 =7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me verify that. Because 29,524 \u00d7 3: 29,524 \u00d7 3 = (30,000 - 476) \u00d73 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 +3 =4\n\nL2 =1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nL3=1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nL4=1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nL5=1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nL6=1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nL7=1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nL8=1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nL9=1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*L9=3*29524=88,572\n\nThat seems correct. But let me check each step again to be sure.\n\nL1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute L9 again:\n\n3*9841: 9841*3=29,523, then 29,523 +1=29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 29,524*3: As above, 88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer step by step. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nThis looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is defined as L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1=4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r = 3r, which seems off. Wait, no, for a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*r^n, where r is the solution to r = a*r, which in this case, a=3, so r=3.\n\nWait, but the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)}, where L_n^{(h)} is the homogeneous solution, and L_n^{(p)} is a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution satisfies L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, so L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's take n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nL4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nL5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nL6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\nL7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\nL8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\nL9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute each layer without having to compute each step manually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut in this problem, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable, but having a formula is useful for understanding the pattern.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can compute each nested layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( L_1 = 4 \\). By calculating each layer up to \\( L_9 \\) and then multiplying by 3, we find the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (L\u2081):**\n   \\[\n   L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2 (L\u2082):**\n   \\[\n   L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3 (L\u2083):**\n   \\[\n   L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4 (L\u2084):**\n   \\[\n   L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5 (L\u2085):**\n   \\[\n   L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6 (L\u2086):**\n   \\[\n   L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7 (L\u2087):**\n   \\[\n   L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8 (L\u2088):**\n   \\[\n   L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9 (L\u2089):**\n   \\[\n   L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Expression:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3(1 + 3)). Wait, let me make sure I'm identifying the layers correctly. Each time, we have 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then the next layer out is (1 + 3*(innermost result)). So, let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. The original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost part is Layer 1. So each Layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1, which is 4, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4=13, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13=40, and so on until Layer 9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me make sure. The expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I have to compute Layer 9 first, which is 29524, and then multiply by 3. So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do this step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check the multiplication another way.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer 3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, it's 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 3*29524=88572. That seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I have nine layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3s after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, the number of layers is 9. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost layer, and then we have the initial 3 multiplied by that.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me write out the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1))\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3))\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4))\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5))\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6))\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7))\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8))\n\nSo, yes, nine layers. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first ( is Layer 1, then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\nEach time, we have (1+3(...)), so the number of ( is 9, right? Because after the first 3, there are nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, yes, nine layers.\n\nSo, the computation seems correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I compute 3*(Layer 9), is that correct? Because the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nIn general, if we have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers, it forms a geometric progression. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each step is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nSo, the recurrence is:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nSo, each Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Lk.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is Lk = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, with L1=4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is Lk - 3*Lk-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Lk^h = C*3^k.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant, say Lk^p = D.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D =1 => D= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is Lk = C*3^k -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When k=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is Lk= (3/2)*3^k -1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: Lk= (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for k=9, L9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I computed earlier. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but in this case, since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, starting from L1=4, each subsequent layer is 3*L_prev +1.\n\nSo, L2=3*4 +1=13\n\nL3=3*13 +1=40\n\nAnd so on, which is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10=59049, then (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524, and 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses are the last (1 + 3). Let me write that down as the first step. Let's call this level 1: Level 1: (1 + 3) That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, level 1 equals 4. Now, moving one level out, we have another set of parentheses where it's 1 + 3 times the result of level 1. Let me write that as level 2: Level 2: (1 + 3*(Level 1)) Since Level 1 is 4, this becomes (1 + 3*4). Calculating that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, level 2 equals 13. Now, moving out another level, we have level 3: Level 3: (1 + 3*(Level 2)) Substituting Level 2 as 13, this becomes (1 + 3*13). Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, level 3 is 40. Continuing this pattern, let's do level 4: Level 4: (1 + 3*(Level 3)) Level 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Level 4 is 121. Level 5: (1 + 3*(Level 4)) 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Level 5 is 364. Level 6: (1 + 3*(Level 5)) 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Level 6 is 1093. Level 7: (1 + 3*(Level 6)) 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Level 7 is 3280. Level 8: (1 + 3*(Level 7)) 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Level 8 is 9841. Level 9: (1 + 3*(Level 8)) 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Level 9 is 29524. Now, after computing all nine levels, the entire expression inside the first set of parentheses is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 multiplied by this entire result. So, the final step is to compute 3 times 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's compute this step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. So, putting it together, 29524 * 3 is 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8. So, yes, that gives 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each level was computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the previous level's result. I went through nine levels, each time calculating the new value, and then finally multiplied the ninth level's result by 3. Each step seemed straightforward, and I double-checked the multiplication at the end. I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous level's result. After computing each level up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested parentheses, each of the form (1 + 3*(...)), with nine levels in total.\n\n2. **Compute from the innermost level:**\n   - **Level 1**: (1 + 3) = 4\n   - **Level 2**: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - **Level 3**: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - **Level 4**: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - **Level 5**: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - **Level 6**: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - **Level 7**: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - **Level 8**: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - **Level 9**: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the final result by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute this step by step, starting from the innermost part and moving outward. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. So, let's compute each layer one by one. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12, then add 1: 12 + 1 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, then add 1: 39 + 1 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, add 1: 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, actually, that might be a bit error-prone. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3 is 27, write down 7 and carry over 2. Finally, 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write 7, carryover 0.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carryover 0.\nFinally, the next digit is 2 (from 29524) which is 2*3=6, no carryover.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: digits are 2,9,5,2,4. So when multiplying:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. So 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Hmm, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward.

Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 1 + 39 = 40. Okay, so now we have 40. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*40. That would be 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Alright, 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is... let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, 29524. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. So, the result inside the outermost parentheses is 88573.

    "text": " Let me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. So, let's compute that first. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, this layer becomes 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here, but let me check a few more layers to be sure. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(40). Calculating that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, this layer is 121. Another layer: 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute that: 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. So, that's 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). Calculating this: 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, this layer is 1093. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute this: 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, that's 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Calculating this: 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, this layer is 9841. Another layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that: 3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that's 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let me calculate this: 3*29524 = 88572, then 1 + 88572 = 88573. So, the entire inner part simplifies to 88573. Now, the original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that: 3*80000 = 240000, 3*8000 = 24000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*70 = 210, and 3*3 = 9. Adding these up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000; 264000 + 1500 = 265500; 265500 + 210 = 265710; 265710 + 9 = 265719. So, 3*88573 = 265719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265719. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then 1+3*4=13. Then 1+3*13=40. Then 1+3*40=121. Then 1+3*121=364. Then 1+3*364=1093. Then 1+3*1093=3280. Then 1+3*3280=9841. Then 1+3*9841=29524. Then 1+3*29524=88573. Then 3*88573=265719. Yep, that seems consistent. I don't think I made any errors in the multiplication or addition steps. Each step built on the previous one, and the numbers increased exponentially, which makes sense because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, leading to a kind of geometric progression. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 265719.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

    "text": " Let me number the layers from the inside out for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one out is Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (since it's the innermost, there's nothing inside) Wait, no, actually, looking again, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Because each layer is 1 + 3(...). So, starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result). So, let's compute each layer step by step. Let me make a table to keep track:\n\nLayer | Expression | Computation | Result\n-----|------------|-------------|-------\n1    | 1 + 3      | 1 + 3 = 4   | 4\n2    | 1 + 3*(Layer1) | 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 | 13\n3    | 1 + 3*(Layer2) | 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 | 40\n4    | 1 + 3*(Layer3) | 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 | 121\n5    | 1 + 3*(Layer4) | 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 | 364\n6    | 1 + 3*(Layer5) | 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 | 1093\n7    | 1 + 3*(Layer6) | 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 | 3280\n8    | 1 + 3*(Layer7) | 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 | 9841\n9    | 1 + 3*(Layer8) | 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 | 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times the outermost layer, right? So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but given the repeated multiplications by 3, it might make sense. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Let me confirm this multiplication: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count the opening parentheses: starting from the left, each 1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count them: 1. 1+3(...) 2. 1+3(...) 3. 1+3(...) 4. 1+3(...) 5. 1+3(...) 6. 1+3(...) 7. 1+3(...) 8. 1+3(...) 9. 1+3(...)) So yes, 9 layers. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, as I computed. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Substituting into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the final result is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. I think that's solid. So, the step-by-step process is: 1. Recognize the nested structure with 9 layers. 2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost (Layer 1) up to Layer 9. 3. Alternatively, use the recurrence relation and solve it to find a direct formula for Layer 9. 4. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3 to get the final answer. Either way, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this for the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer to keep track. Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1, then the next one out is Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Okay, that seems manageable. Let me compute each layer one by one. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 is 39. So, Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Well, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Therefore, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Thus, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Therefore, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 = 60000; 3*9000 = 27000; 3*500 = 1500; 3*24 = 72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Hmm, that might be a good way to approach it. So, let me define each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2).

Each step follows logically, and I didn't see any errors upon reviewing. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model it as a geometric series or find a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me think about the recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of Layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, as we found earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it, we arrive at the same result. This method might have saved time if I had recognized the pattern earlier, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step by step was manageable.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a base-3 number or a geometric progression. But in this case, since each term depends on the previous one, the recurrence relation approach was the most straightforward.\n\nIn summary, by either computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form solution using recurrence relations, we arrive at the final result of 88572. It's always good to verify the result using different methods to ensure accuracy, especially with such a nested and repetitive structure.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting with the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " That sounds manageable. Let me start by labeling each layer to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9, with the entire expression being Layer 9 multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, looking again, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3), and so on, until Layer 9, which would just be 1 + 3*(something). But actually, when I count the parentheses, I think there are nine layers, but let me check. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: starting from the left, the first parenthesis is after the first 1, then each subsequent parenthesis is after each 1. So, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), which itself contains another (1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how deep it goes. Starting from the innermost, each closing parenthesis corresponds to an opening one. Let's see: the innermost is the last one, which is (1 + 3), then each preceding one adds another layer. So, if I start from the innermost, that's Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then Layer 2 is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)), Layer 3 is (1 + 3*(Layer 2)), and so on until Layer 9, which would be the outermost. So, actually, there are nine layers here. So, starting from Layer 1, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is (1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward to Layer 9, then multiply by 3 at the end. Let me write this down step by step. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That's simple enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1092 +1 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 3279 +1 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 9840 +1 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 29523 +1 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, actually, 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 +72=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it again. 29524 *3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, it's easier to compute 29524*3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, that might be confusing. Alternatively, 29524 *3: 29524*3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24)*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 +72=60000+27000=87000+1500=88500+72=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's right. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything. I started from the innermost parentheses, computed each layer step by step, and then multiplied the outermost layer by 3. Each step involved multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and adding 1. It's a recursive-like process, but since the problem is finite, I could compute each layer one by one. It's a bit tedious, but since each layer depends only on the previous one, it's manageable. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Then, moving out, the next layer is (1 + 3*(previous result)), and so on.

So, I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, each time substituting the previous layer's result into the next. Let me write this down step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So, 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.

So, if I compute layer 1, then layer 2, and so on, I can build up the solution step by step. Let me try that. Starting with layer 1: Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12. So, 1 + 12 = 13. So, layer 2 is 13. Moving on to layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 Let me compute 3*13. 3 times 10 is 30, and 3 times 3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, layer 3 is 40. Hmm, interesting. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40. Wait, let me compute a few more layers to see if a pattern emerges. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplication steps. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

    "text": " Let's start by labeling each layer to keep track. Let me define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say the innermost expression is Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine layers. Wait, actually, looking back, the problem has 9 layers of parentheses, so the outermost 3 is multiplied by Layer 9. So, I think it's better to work from the innermost to the outermost, computing each layer step by step. So, let's start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let's compute that: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let's compute that: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.

Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result of the innermost part. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, now I have 40 as the result for that layer. Moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times 40. Let's compute that: 3*40 is 120, and then 1 + 120 is 121. So, that layer gives me 121. Next layer out, it's 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate that: 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, now I have 364. Moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that layer gives me 1093. Next layer out, it's 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280. Moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that's 9841. Next layer out, it's 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate that: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that's 29524. Now, the outermost layer is 3 times that result. So, 3*29524.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.

    "text": " Let me number the layers from the inside out. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, it's Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is (1 + 3), Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9, which is multiplied by the outermost 3. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13 first: 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Calculating 3*40: that's 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3*29524 should be 88572? Let me check my calculation again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 4*3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. 9*3 = 27, but wait, no, 29524 is 2,9,5,2,4. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carryover.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, so 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. So, all the steps check out. I think that's the correct answer. It seems like each layer was computed correctly, and the multiplication at the end is accurate. So, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the inside out, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost multiplication by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me start from the very inside and work my way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3(4)). Let me compute that. So, inside the parentheses, it's 1 plus 3 times 4. 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 plus 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3(13)). Let me compute that. 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 plus 39 is 40. So, that layer is 40. Let me keep track of each layer as I go. So far, I have:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nHmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me see if I can generalize this. Let me denote each layer as a term in a sequence where each term is defined by the previous term. Let's say:\n\n- Let a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n- Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- And so on, up to a\u2089, since there are nine layers.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the original expression, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, each \"1 + 3(...)\" adds a layer.\n\nSo, actually, the number of layers is 9. Let me confirm that by counting the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another \"1 + 3(\" until we reach the outermost.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost as layer 1, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, the total number of layers is 9. Therefore, I need to compute up to a\u2089. Let me proceed step by step.\n\n1. a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. a\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. a\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. a\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. a\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but after a\u2089, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, the final result is 3*a\u2089. Let me make sure I'm not missing that. The original expression is 3*(...), where ... is the nested expression up to a\u2089. So, yes, after computing a\u2089, I need to multiply it by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nSo, let me list each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\n1. a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. a\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. a\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. a\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. a\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. a\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. a\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. a\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. a\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's do that step by step:\n\n- 29,524 * 3:\n  - 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n  - 2*3 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n  - 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n  - 9*3 +1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n  - 2*3 +2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, 29,524 *3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3\n= 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 +12\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 +27,000 =87,000\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n88,500 +60=88,560\n88,560 +12=88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*a\u2089=88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the computation of a\u2089. Because if I made a mistake in a\u2088, then all subsequent terms would be wrong. Let's go back and verify each step.\n\nStarting from a\u2081:\n\n1. a\u2081 =1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. a\u2082=1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. a\u2083=1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. a\u2084=1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. a\u2085=1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. a\u2086=1+3*364=1+1,092=1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. a\u2087=1+3*1,093=1+3,279=3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. a\u2088=1+3*3,280=1+9,840=9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. a\u2089=1+3*9,841=1+29,523=29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait a second, in my earlier calculation, I wrote a\u2089 as 29,524, but when I computed 3*29,524, I got 88,572. But let me check: 9,841 *3 is 29,523, right? Because 9,841*3:\n\n9,000*3=27,000\n\n800*3=2,400 \u2192 27,000+2,400=29,400\n\n40*3=120 \u2192 29,400+120=29,520\n\n1*3=3 \u2192 29,520+3=29,523\n\nSo, a\u2089=1+29,523=29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*a\u2089=3*29,524=88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of \"1+3(\" from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 2\n...\nUp to layer 9.\n\nYes, so a\u2081 to a\u2089 are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nEach term a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from a\u2081=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081=4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a\u2099 = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C -3C=1 \u2192 -2C=1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a\u2081=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3\u00b9 -1/2 \u2192 4 =3A -1/2 \u2192 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a\u2099= (3/2)*3\u207f -1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u2099= (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\na\u2081= (3^(2)-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na\u2082=(3\u00b3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na\u2083=(3\u2074 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a\u2089= (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2,187\n\n3^8=6,561\n\n3^9=19,683\n\n3^10=59,049\n\nSo, a\u2089=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089=3*29,524=88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using both the iterative method and the formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\), starting with the innermost value of 4. By iteratively applying this pattern up to nine layers, we find the value at each step. Finally, multiplying the result of the ninth layer by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, okay, so each time I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually because that might take a while. Let's denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let me define a sequence where each term is built by this pattern. Let's say a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the sequence. Starting from a\u2081: a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. a\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a\u2086 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092. Then, a\u2086 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. That's correct. a\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, a\u2087 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. a\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840. Then, a\u2088 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. a\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, a\u2089 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Okay, so a\u2089 = 29524. Now, looking back at the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(a\u2089). Because the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is 3*a\u2089. So, the total expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify each step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's see, 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the general formula for such expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. This is similar to a geometric series, but it's a bit different because each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a\u2099.\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\na\u2081 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 29524\n\nI notice that each a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple recurrence, maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is: a\u2099 = 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a\u2099 = 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, which has the solution a\u2099^(h) = C*3\u207f.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a\u2099^(p) = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = C*3\u207f - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3\u00b9 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier terms:\n\nFor n=1: a\u2081 = (3\u00b2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3\u00b3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3\u2074 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3\u2075 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3\u2076 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3\u2077 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3\u2078 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3\u2079 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a\u2089=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this expression as a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. But the formula I derived seems to handle it correctly.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is essentially building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, considering the expression, each step is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to building a number where each digit is 1 in base 3. Let me see:\n\nIf I consider each 1 as a digit in base 3, then the innermost is 1 + 3*1=4, which is 11 in base 3 (1*3 +1). Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(11 base3)=1 + 3*4=13, which is 111 in base 3 (1*9 +1*3 +1). Similarly, the next layer would be 1 + 3*13=40, which is 1111 in base 3, and so on.\n\nIndeed, each layer adds another '1' in base 3, so a\u2099 corresponds to the number with n+1 '1's in base 3. For example, a\u2081=4=11 base3, a\u2082=13=111 base3, a\u2083=40=1111 base3, etc. Therefore, a\u2099 is equal to (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula I derived earlier.\n\nSo, for n=9, a\u2089=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then the total expression is 3*a\u2089=88572.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and the repeating pattern.\n\n2. Start computing from the innermost parentheses, working my way outward.\n\n3. Notice that each layer follows a recurrence relation, so I derived a general formula for the nth term.\n\n4. Verified the formula with the initial terms to ensure its correctness.\n\n5. Applied the formula to find the 9th term, which was the innermost part of the original expression.\n\n6. Multiplied that result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n7. Double-checked the multiplication to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n\n8. Considered alternative approaches, like viewing it as a base-3 number, which reinforced the correctness of the formula.\n\nBy following these steps, I systematically broke down the problem, identified a pattern, used it to find a general solution, and then applied it to the specific case given. This method helped me avoid getting lost in the complexity of the nested expressions and made the problem manageable.\n\nI think that's about it. I can't think of any steps I might have missed or any errors in my reasoning. I've verified each part, so I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and the repeating pattern. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute from the innermost parentheses outward. Let's define a sequence \\( a_n \\) where each term is built by the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\).\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. The entire expression is \\( 3 \\cdot a_9 \\):\n   - Compute \\( 3 \\cdot 29524 \\):\n     - \\( 29524 \\times 3 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me number the layers from the inside out to keep track. Starting with the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer wraps that result with 1 + 3*(result). Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, let me make sure. So, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and since Layer 1 is 4, 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. That seems correct.\n\nMoving out to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That seems right.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, that's correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That's correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication: 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, yes, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check: 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Yes, that's correct. Then, 3279 +1 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 +1 is 9841. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute that. 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again: 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 +1 is 29524. That seems right.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the multiplication steps.\n\nLet me go back through each layer to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572. Let me verify that multiplication again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000 \u2192 60000 +27000=87000\n\n500*3=1500 \u219287000 +1500=88500\n\n20*3=60 \u219288500 +60=88560\n\n4*3=12 \u219288560 +12=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient and less error-prone, especially if the number of layers increases.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). This is a recursive pattern. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1.\n\nSo,\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\na_2=1 +3*a1=1 +12=13\n\na_3=1 +3*a2=1 +39=40\n\na_4=1 +3*a3=1 +120=121\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in general, a_{n} =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)}=C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)}=A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA =3*A +1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA -3A =1\n\n-2A=1\n\nA= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)}= C*3^n -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2\n\n4 =3C -1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 +1/2 =3C\n\n9/2=3C\n\nC= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\na9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the 9th layer, a9, is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572, as computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a9= (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, then 3*a9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's see: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula.\n\nBut in any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, the result is the same: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute each layer efficiently. Using this approach, each layer is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use the result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(previous result).\n3. Repeat this process for each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost layer.\n4. Finally, multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nUsing the formula derived from the linear recurrence relation, we find that the value of the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). That means I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9 and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nLet me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because 29524 * 3 shouldn't be 88572. Let me do it digit by digit.\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n---------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Hmm, that's the same result as before. So maybe it is correct. Let me confirm using another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when multiplying step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo all layers are correct, and the final multiplication is correct. So the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So when I computed Layer 9, it's 1 + 3*Layer8, which is correct. Then the entire expression is 3*Layer9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So using the closed-form expression also leads me to the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each layer as a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the previous layer is 1 + 3*(the one before that), and so on. So, if I expand the entire expression, it might form a geometric series.\n\nLet me try expanding the innermost layers to see the pattern.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, but when I compute Layer 3: 1 + 3*13, that's 1 + 39, which is 40. Similarly, Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, which is 1 + 120.\n\nWait, but 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121, which is 11^2. Hmm, interesting. But maybe that's a coincidence.\n\nBut looking at the expansion, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand all the layers, it's like a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me think about the expansion. Let's denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and this repeats nine times, then multiplied by 3 again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers.\n\nBut since I've already computed it using both iterative and closed-form methods, and both gave me the same answer, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing it another way. Let's expand the entire expression step by step without using the closed-form formula.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute the innermost 1 + 3:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, compute 1 + 3*(4):\n\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, it's consistent across different methods. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've considered multiple approaches: iterative computation, closed-form solution using recurrence relations, and direct expansion. All methods lead to the same result, so I don't see any reason to doubt the answer. It seems solid.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and realize that each layer depends on the previous one.\n\n2. Start computing from the innermost layer, moving outward step by step.\n\n3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using recurrence relations to confirm the result.\n\n4. Compute the final result by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\n5. Verify each step to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n\n6. Consider alternative approaches to confirm the result.\n\nThis thorough approach helps minimize errors and ensures that the solution is correct.\n\nAnother thing I could consider is checking if there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions in general, which might help in solving similar problems more efficiently in the future. For example, recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression.\n\nWait, let me think about that. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the previous layer is 1 + 3*(the one before that), etc., this is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, perhaps the sum can be expressed as a geometric series.\n\nLet me try to express the entire inner expression before the outermost 3.\n\nLet me denote S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers.\n\nThen, S can be written as S = 1 + 3*S1, where S1 is the next layer, which is 1 + 3*S2, and so on, until S9 = 1 + 3*4.\n\nBut since we have nine layers, S9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, S8 = 1 + 3*S9 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on, which is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which for n=9 gives S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, using the geometric series approach also confirms the result.\n\nI think I've covered all possible ways to approach this problem and each time, the answer is consistent. Therefore, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, and then multiplying the result by 3, we find the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Compute Layer 1 (innermost):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Compute Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compute Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Compute Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Compute Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Compute Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Compute Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Multiply the result by 3:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me start by identifying the innermost part. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, (1 + 3) equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 1 + 12 equals 13. Okay, so the second layer gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 1 + 39 equals 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let me keep track of each step to avoid confusion. Maybe I can list each layer as I go along, starting from the innermost. Let's number the layers from 1 to 9, where layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3) and layer 9 is the outermost expression. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, that would be 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let me do that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, it's 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers, let me go through the layers again quickly. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... (1 + 3)...))), with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a repeated multiplication. Let me consider the general form: If we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent a_n is computed as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, in this case, since there are nine layers, we can think of it as a_9, where a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524, as I computed earlier. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same number. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series of terms where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find each layer's value and use it in the next.

Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, with the outermost being Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (that's the innermost part, right?) Wait, no, actually, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9. Hmm, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's define each layer as follows: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, until Layer 9. Then, the entire expression would be 3*(Layer 9). So, I can compute each layer sequentially. Let me start computing each layer one by one. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3; so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me verify that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that seems right. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. To be thorough, maybe I can check the computation of Layer 9 and the final multiplication again. Layer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 29524 * 3: Let's compute it as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Adding 29524 + 29524: 29524*2 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000=79048, 79048 + 9000=88048, 88048 + 500=88548, 88548 + 24=88572. Yes, that's the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": " Let me try to parse this step by step. Let's start from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the second innermost part is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, the third layer from the inside is 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(40). Calculating that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. The fourth layer is 121. Continuing outward: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Fifth layer is 364. Next: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Sixth layer is 1093. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(1093). 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Seventh layer is 3280. Next: 1 + 3*(3280). 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Eighth layer is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute that: 3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, the innermost part was 4, then each subsequent layer was built upon that. Now, the entire expression inside the outermost 3(...) is 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me do this step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss any layers. Starting from the innermost (1+3)=4, then each layer was 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make it quicker. Looking at the results of each layer: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, each of these seems to be following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term minus something? Let me check: 13 = 3*4 +1? Wait, 3*4=12, 12 +1=13. 40 = 3*13 +1? 3*13=39, 39 +1=40. 121 = 3*40 +1=121. Yes, that seems to be the pattern. Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent term is 3n +1, where n is the previous term. So, if I recognize this, it's a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. Solving this recurrence relation might give me a formula to compute the nth term without having to compute each step. Let me recall how to solve such recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution and particular solution. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2= (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2= (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, the 9th term, which is the one before multiplying by 3, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrive at the same result. This method might be faster if I recognize the pattern early on, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad. It's good to know both methods: the step-by-step computation and the formula derived from the recurrence relation. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing this pattern, we can compute each layer step by step starting from the innermost parentheses. \n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4. The outermost layer is 1 + 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
