    "text": " Let me try to label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (since that's the innermost part) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). That seems like a manageable approach. Let me start computing each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That was simple. Now Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364. Let me compute that: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me verify each layer quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. I wonder if this expression relates to a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try to find A and B. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this formula with the layers we computed. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f For n=5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f For n=6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f For n=7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f For n=8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f For n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works for each layer. So, using this formula, we can compute L_9 directly without computing each layer, which would save time, especially if there were more layers. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*(29524) = 88572, as we calculated earlier. Alternatively, using the formula for L_n, we can write the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's another way to look at it, using exponents. So, the expression simplifies to (3^{11} - 3)/2, which is 88572. That's a much quicker way if we recognize the pattern and apply the formula for the linear recurrence. But since I initially didn't see that, I worked through each layer step by step, which also worked. It's reassuring that both methods give the same result. I think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\). Using the formula derived for such a recurrence relation, \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\), we compute the ninth layer and then multiply by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   Each layer is defined as \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\), starting with \\(L_1 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Derive the Formula:**\n   The general solution for the recurrence is \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\n3. **Compute Layer 9:**\n   \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me try computing each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39. Then, Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Therefore, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Thus, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Hence, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step seems correct. Each time, I multiplied the previous layer by 3 and added 1, which seems to follow the pattern correctly. Then, the final multiplication by 3 gave me 88,572. I think that's the right answer. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time worked well. I don't see any errors in my computations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n1.

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's begin. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.

Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Let's go through each step again quickly:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern. Wait, this looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this as a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's see, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition: a1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, that confirms that the step-by-step calculation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression in terms of a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nBut when expanded, it's like 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to a certain number of terms. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the innermost term is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*1. But actually, when you expand it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nLet me try expanding the entire expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me see how many 3s and 1s there are when expanding.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to consider that each time we have a term like 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which when expanded becomes 3*1 + 3^2*(...) etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see:\n\nIf I expand E step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me compute the innermost part first:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, as before.\n\nAlternatively, when expanding E, each layer adds a new term. Let me see:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIf I expand each layer:\n\nFirst, innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, next: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to nine layers.\n\nWait, but when I expand E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which would be 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to 9 terms, perhaps? Wait, no, because each layer is another multiplication by 3. Let me see:\n\nWait, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous value). So, when I expand E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nLet me try expanding E step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count how many times 1 appears. There are nine layers, each contributing a 1, so when expanded, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a sum.\n\nWait, from the earlier expansion, each a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let me see if I can express E as a sum.\n\nWait, since each a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, another way to compute E is to recognize that it's equal to (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nThat's a much faster way if I can remember the formula.\n\nBut since I was able to compute it step by step, and also derive the formula, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{11}.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer step by step as I did earlier, which also gave me 88572.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3.

    "text": " Let's start from the very inside. The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's simple enough. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, let's define each layer as a term. Let me denote each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) and so on, up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that might be a better way to approach it. So, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, I can substitute each result into the next layer. Let me try that. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's do this step by step to avoid mistakes. 29,524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carryover 1. 2*3 = 6 +1 =7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can break it down: 29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss any layers. I started from the innermost Layer 1, which was 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 was 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 was 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to Layer 9, which was 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gave me 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me check if I counted the layers properly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is built upon the previous one, and I went through nine layers. So, Layer 1: 1+3, Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, I think I did it correctly. Let me just verify the computations for each layer again to ensure there are no arithmetic errors. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that all checks out. I think I've got it right. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me clarify. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then the next layer out is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out gives me 13. Now, moving one more layer out, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, that layer is 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, 121. That's interesting. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let's see, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093).

Now, Layer 2 is: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 2: 13 Now, Layer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9: 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, let's compute that: 3 * 29524 = ? Let me do that multiplication step by step. First, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, putting it all together: 6 (from 2*3), then 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, actually, I think I messed up the order. Let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n29524\n*     3\n---------\n?\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, we have 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, when multiplying, we start from the right and move left, so the digits are written from right to left. So, the first digit is 2, then 7, then 5, then 8, then 8. So, the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, 9 + 9 = 18, 2 + 2 = 4. So, 59048. Then, add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add: 8 + 4 = 12, 4 + 2 = 6, 0 + 5 = 5, 9 + 9 = 18, 5 + 2 = 7. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me do it properly:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5. Write down 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18. Write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the sum is 88572. So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me recompute each layer quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost multiplication by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let's start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). That seems manageable. Let me try computing each layer step by step. Let's begin with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let's calculate that: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Let's go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me recheck 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, total 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, total 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, total 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, total 29523. 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did it right. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and by working from the inside out, I was able to compute each step without getting lost. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time makes it manageable. I don't think I made any calculation errors this time, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3(4) = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3(13) = 40\n4.

Layer 9: 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the result:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me denote each layer as follows to make it clearer. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's say:\n\n- Let\u2019s define a\u2081 = 1 + 3\n- Then a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081\n- Then a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082\n- And so on, until a\u2089, since there are nine layers.\n\nWait, but actually, looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1+3), then each subsequent layer wraps around that with another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, let me compute each step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out:\n\n3. 1 + 3*(result from step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a jump. Let me double-check that. So, step 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Step 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Step 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nContinuing:\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Then: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Then: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Then: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Finally: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nSo, if I'm computing each layer from 1 to 9, then the result after nine layers would be 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this result, right? Wait, no. Let me check again. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested parentheses. So, actually, the expression is 3*(a\u2089), where a\u2089 is the result after nine layers. So, if a\u2089 is 29524, then the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3*\" is a layer, and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of times I applied the 1 + 3*(...) operation. I did it nine times, starting from the innermost. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost parentheses before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, now, compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 29000 * 3 = 87,000\n\nThen, 524 * 3 = 1,572\n\nAdding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572\n\nSo, the total value is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each step carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again. 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, that gives 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I started, I thought each layer was 1 + 3*(previous), but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine instances of (1 + 3*(...)). So, each time, we have a 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was the innermost being (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adding another 1 + 3*(...). So, Layer 1 is (1 + 3), Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on until Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, but let me count the number of times 1 + 3*(...) is applied. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1,093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1,093) = 3,280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3,280) = 9,841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9,841) = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be error-prone, especially with so many layers. Let me think about whether there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for this kind of nested multiplication.\n\nEach layer is defined as a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from a\u2081 = 4 (since the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4). So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a\u2099.\n\nThe recurrence is a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a\u2099^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a\u2099^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a\u2099 = a\u2099^h + a\u2099^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have nine layers, n = 9.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (3^(9+1) - 1)/2 = (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2,187\n\n3^8 = 6,561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation I did earlier. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each time, the term is multiplied by 3, so perhaps the expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms. But given that the recurrence solution worked out, and both methods give the same result, I think it's solid.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2,187, 3^8 is 6,561, 3^9 is 19,683, 3^10 is indeed 59,049.\n\nSo, (59,049 - 1)/2 is 59,048/2, which is 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe result after nine layers is 29524. The entire expression is then 3 times this result:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me define each part as follows:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as A9, then moving outward, A8, A7, and so on until A1.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nA9 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, A8 = 1 + 3*A9\n\nA7 = 1 + 3*A8\n\nAnd so on, until A1, which would be the entire expression, and then the final result would be 3*A1.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(A1), where A1 is 1 + 3*(A2), and A2 is 1 + 3*(A3), etc., down to A9 = 1 + 3.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should write each step down sequentially. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost expression:\n\nA9 = 1 + 3\n\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4.\n\nSo, A9 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, A8 = 1 + 3*A9.\n\nSince A9 is 4, that becomes:\n\nA8 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so A8 is 13.\n\nNext, A7 = 1 + 3*A8.\n\nSubstituting A8 = 13:\n\nA7 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAlright, A7 is 40.\n\nMoving outward, A6 = 1 + 3*A7.\n\nSubstituting A7 = 40:\n\nA6 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nSo, A6 is 121.\n\nContinuing this way, A5 = 1 + 3*A6.\n\nA6 is 121, so:\n\nA5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nA5 is 364.\n\nNext, A4 = 1 + 3*A5.\n\nSubstituting A5 = 364:\n\nA4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nA4 is 1093.\n\nThen, A3 = 1 + 3*A4.\n\nA4 is 1093, so:\n\nA3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nA3 is 3280.\n\nMoving outward, A2 = 1 + 3*A3.\n\nA3 is 3280:\n\nA2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nA2 is 9841.\n\nNow, A1 = 1 + 3*A2.\n\nA2 is 9841:\n\nA1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nA1 is 29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*A1, which is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication step because it's crucial. 29524 times 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000*3 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\nNext, 500*3 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\nThen, 20*3 = 60, so 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\nFinally, 4*3 = 12, so 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step builds upon the previous one, leading to the final result of 88,572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each layer was a simple calculation, and by breaking it down step by step, it wasn't too bad. I just had to make sure I kept track of each substitution correctly and didn't mix up the layers. It's like peeling an onion; each layer reveals the next one, and eventually, you get to the core. In this case, the core was the innermost parentheses, and each subsequent layer added more complexity until we reached the final result.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me double-check a couple of steps. Let's pick A3 and A2.\n\nA3 was calculated as 1 + 3*A4, where A4 was 1093. So, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nThen A2 is 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nA1 is 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let me compute that again. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*29524: As I did before, it's 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps check out.

    "text": " Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward is Layer 2, up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking at the expression, the innermost part is 1+3, right? Because the very last parenthesis is (1+3). So, Layer 1 would be (1 + 3). Then Layer 2 would be 3*(1 + Layer1). Then Layer3 would be 3*(1 + Layer2), and so on until Layer9. Wait, but actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is multiplied by 3. Let me think again. Maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work outward, calculating each step as I go. So, let's start with the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4. Let's note that down as Layer 1: Layer1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(Layer1)). So, Layer2 = 1 + 3*(Layer1). Since Layer1 is 4, Layer2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer2 is 13. Now, moving out another layer, Layer3 = 1 + 3*(Layer2). So, Layer3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Got it. Layer3 is 40. Next, Layer4 = 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer4 is 121. Then, Layer5 = 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer5 is 364. Moving on, Layer6 = 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate that: 3*364 is 1092, so Layer6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer6 is 1093. Next, Layer7 = 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so total is 3000+270+9=3279. Then Layer7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer7 is 3280. Now, Layer8 = 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then Layer8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer8 is 9841. Finally, Layer9 = 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, Layer9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let's calculate that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer1: 1+3=4. Layer2: 1+3*4=13. Layer3: 1+3*13=40. Layer4: 1+3*40=121. Layer5: 1+3*121=364. Layer6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see: Each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a(n-1), starting from a(1)=4. So, the recurrence is a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1)=4. Let's see if that holds. a(1)=4, a(2)=1+3*4=13, a(3)=1+3*13=40, which matches what I did before. So, the sequence is 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524. Then, the final result is 3*a(9)=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a(n) = c*a(n-1) + d is a(n) = c^n * a(0) + d*(c^n - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, in this case, our recurrence is a(n) = 3*a(n-1) + 1, right? Because a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), which can be written as a(n) = 3*a(n-1) + 1. So, the standard form is a(n) = c*a(n-1) + d, where c=3 and d=1. The general solution for such a recurrence is a(n) = (a(0) - d/(c-1)) * c^n + d/(c-1). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. The homogeneous solution is a_h(n) = A*c^n, and the particular solution is a_p(n) = K, a constant. Plugging into the equation: K = c*K + d => K - c*K = d => K*(1 - c) = d => K = d/(1 - c). Wait, but in our case, c=3, so K = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, the general solution is a(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a(1)=4. Wait, but wait, in our problem, a(1)=4. So, when n=1, a(1)=4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a(9))=3*( (3^10 -1)/2 )= (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula for the linear recurrence, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me assign each layer a number to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one out is Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. That way, I can compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving out to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13. Next, Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate 3*121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, this might be a bit tricky. Let me break it down: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Now, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to slip up. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to confirm: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after going through each layer step by step, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me check the last multiplication once more. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. Okay, so I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working outward. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost 3 by Layer 9:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1, then moving outward, each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking again, the very outermost layer is 3 times (1 + 3(...)), so maybe Layer 1 is the innermost, and each Layer n is built by adding 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). Let me check that. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nSo, Layer 2: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*Layer9. So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer step by step again, just to double-check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the original problem again to make sure I counted the layers correctly. The original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let's count the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until we have nine layers, I think. Wait, but when I counted earlier, I had nine layers, each being (1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, the outermost is 3*(layer9). So, perhaps the count is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is different. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), so let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each (1+3(...)) is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another (1 + 3(...))\n...\nContinuing until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, each time, it's a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. (1 + 3*(Layer1)) \u2192 Layer2\n3. (1 + 3*(Layer2)) \u2192 Layer3\n4. (1 + 3*(Layer3)) \u2192 Layer4\n5. (1 + 3*(Layer4)) \u2192 Layer5\n6. (1 + 3*(Layer5)) \u2192 Layer6\n7. (1 + 3*(Layer6)) \u2192 Layer7\n8. (1 + 3*(Layer7)) \u2192 Layer8\n9. (1 + 3*(Layer8)) \u2192 Layer9\n\nYes, so that's nine layers, each building upon the previous. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, as I computed earlier, Layer9 is 29524, so 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each layer again, just step by step, to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13: 13*3 is 39. Then 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120. 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121: 121*3. Let's compute 120*3=360, plus 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, Layer9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again to be thorough.\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 =7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n5 * 3 =15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 =27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n\u00d7         3\n\n------------\n\nLet's compute:\n\n4 * 3 =12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 =6 +1=7\n\n5 * 3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've missed any layers or miscounted. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1+3(...), and each time, the innermost is (1+3), so each layer adds one more 3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, as I've computed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, starting with a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13,\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40,\n\nand so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B =1 \u2192 -2B=1 \u2192 B= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier. So, Layer9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked each step, used both iterative computation and a closed-form formula to arrive at the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost: Let\u2019s say the innermost part is Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me start computing each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that was straightforward. Layer 1 is 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121: 363\n\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: Let's see, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092\n\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279\n\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840\n\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nCompute that: 3*29524. Let's compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that. It's easy to make a mistake in such long calculations. Let me check each step again.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute this again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, carryover 1\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nHmm, just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. It might save time if I recognize a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works perfectly. So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have directly used this formula for each layer. That would have saved time, especially if there were more layers.\n\nBut since the problem only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, although it was a bit time-consuming and prone to arithmetic errors. Using the formula is much more efficient.\n\nSo, knowing that Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with each layer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer starting from the innermost part:\n\n- **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, that seems manageable. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me write each layer down and compute it.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... Let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is... 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is... Let me compute that. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... Hmm, let's compute that. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is actually 88572. Let me verify that with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer was computed step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, and each time substituting the computed value into the next layer. Finally, multiplying the last layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. It's easy to miscalculate with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each layer checks out, so the final result should be 88572.\n\nI guess another way to think about this is that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series, but since it's nested, it's more of a recursive computation. Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which kind of resembles a geometric progression with a ratio of 3, but the addition complicates things a bit.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write this as a recurrence relation, it might look like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. But in this case, we're starting from the innermost layer, so each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. So, it's a linear recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous term multiplied by 3 and then adding 1.\n\nIf I wanted to generalize this, the nth term would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence relation might give a closed-form expression, but since there are only nine layers, it's more straightforward to compute each one step by step.\n\nBut just for fun, maybe I can try to find a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let's see:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works for each layer. So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula to find the value of layer 9 directly. That might have saved some time, but since I was unsure at first, computing each layer step by step was a safer approach.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using the formula gives the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result of 88572.\n\nI think I've got this. The key was recognizing the pattern and breaking it down into manageable layers. It was a bit tedious with nine layers, but methodically computing each one ensured accuracy. Alternatively, recognizing the recurrence relation allowed me to find a formula, which could be especially useful if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, step-by-step computation was feasible.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is that each layer's value is significantly increasing, which makes sense because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, leading to exponential growth. So, the numbers get large very quickly, which is why the final result is over 88,000.\n\nIn summary, by carefully unwrapping each layer from the inside out and either computing each step manually or using a derived formula, I was able to solve the problem without getting lost in the complexity of the nested expressions.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, with each layer defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). Using a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula to compute Layer 9 directly. Finally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, resulting in the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{next layer})\\), repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Define each layer**:\n   - Layer \\(n\\) = \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer}(n-1)\\), starting with Layer 1 = \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(29524\\)\n\n4. **Final computation**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me assign a variable to each layer to make it easier. Let's say:\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is based on the previous one. Let me call the innermost expression as a base case and build up from there. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from above). Let's compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, that's 1 plus 3 times 4, which is 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, we again have 1 + 3*(previous result). So let's compute that.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so each time, we're taking 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me continue this process step by step.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, if I counted correctly, I should have nine layers here. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen moving out:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, the innermost is 4, and each layer out adds another 3 times the previous result plus 1. So, after computing all nine layers, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times that value. So, the original expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me do that multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the total value is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I correctly computed each layer. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the intermediate steps. Let me go through each layer again.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because 29524 * 3.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me check again because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me recount the layers in the original expression to ensure I didn't miss any.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \u2013 that's the first layer.\n\n2. Inside that, 3(1+3(...)) \u2013 second layer.\n\n3. Then another 3(1+3(...)) \u2013 third.\n\n4. Another \u2013 fourth.\n\n5. Fifth.\n\n6. Sixth.\n\n7. Seventh.\n\n8. Eighth.\n\n9. Ninth.\n\nThen, after the ninth layer, it's closed with ))))))))). So, yes, there are nine layers. So, my earlier computation of nine layers is correct.\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. It might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To be thorough, let me check my steps once more:\n\n1. Identified that the expression is a nested recurrence with nine layers.\n\n2. Computed each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, resulting in a_9 = 29524.\n\n3. Applied the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation, which also gave a_9 = 29524.\n\n4. Multiplied by 3 to get the final result, 88,572.\n\nAll steps seem consistent and checked out. I don't see any errors in the computations or reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a sequence \\( a_n \\) where each term is given by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from the innermost layer. \n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[ a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   a_2 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13, \\\\\n   a_3 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40, \\\\\n   a_4 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121, \\\\\n   a_5 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364, \\\\\n   a_6 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093, \\\\\n   a_7 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280, \\\\\n   a_8 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841, \\\\\n   a_9 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. The entire expression is 3 times the result of the outermost layer:\n   \\[ 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Layer 1 is 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364.

So, putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 and carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 and carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 and carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 2*3=6. So yes, 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.

    "text": " Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So, this layer simplifies to 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. So, that's 121. Continuing outward, next layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Hmm, that's getting big. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093. Wow, okay. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute that. 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 is 3280. That's a pretty big number. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Wow, that's a huge number. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 is 29524. That's a really big number. Now, the next layer out: 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that. 3*29524: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12.

Let me compute that. 3*88573: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265,719.

So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nFirst, let's start with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives us 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is... let's see, 364*3. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093.

So Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3.

Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the later layers where the numbers get large. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think I did all the steps correctly. Each layer builds on the previous one, and by working from the inside out, I was able to compute each layer's value without getting lost. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me check one of the layers again. Let's pick Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 was 364, so 3*364 is indeed 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093. Correct. How about Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 was 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. So, all the layers seem to check out. Therefore, the final result should be 88,572. I feel confident about this answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. That sounds manageable. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 3 is then 1 + 3 times Layer 2: 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3: 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4 = 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate 3*121 first. 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*Layer 7 = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer 8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29000 is 87000, 3*524 is 1572. So, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplication steps. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous one. That recurrence relation is similar to a geometric sequence, but with a constant addition each time. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote L_n as Layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, my formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let me denote each inner expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost one and E9 is the outermost. So, starting from E1: E1 = 1 + 3. Then, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9. Then, the entire expression would be 3*E9. Wait, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(...), so maybe E9 is the innermost one, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...) around it. Let me clarify that. Let me try to parse the expression correctly. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me define each step:\n\n1. Innermost: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3*(E9). So, after computing E9, I need to multiply it by 3. Let me check that again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, the outermost operation is 3*(E9), where E9 is 1 + 3*E8. So, yes, E9 is the innermost expression, and the outermost is 3*E9. So, after computing E9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's do this step by step: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression equals 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because this seems like a lot, and I might have made a mistake in computing E9. Let me go through each step again carefully.\n\nStarting from E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about whether this sequence follows a known pattern. Each term is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since this is a finite sequence with 9 terms, maybe it's easier to compute each step as I did before. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each step is similar to a geometric series. Let's see: E1 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, after computing E9 as 29,524, the final result is 3*29,524 = 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without doing each step manually. Let's consider the general form of such nested expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Here, n=9. Each layer adds another 3*(...) inside. So, the general formula for such a nested expression can be found using the formula for a geometric series. Let's denote the entire expression as S. Then, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for S in terms of n. Let's consider that each time we add a layer, we're effectively multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, after k layers, the value is E_k = 1 + 3*E_{k-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is E_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for E_k.\n\nGiven E_k = 1 + 3*E_{k-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is E_k^h = C*3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume E_k^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition E_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, E_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check for k=1:\n\nE_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.\n\nE_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches.\n\nE_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is E_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for k=9, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, E_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I broke down the expression into layers, computed each one step by step, and then used a general formula for the recurrence relation to find E_9. Both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed until the outermost layer is reached. Using the recurrence relation, each layer can be represented as \\( E_k = \\frac{3^{k+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the innermost layer (k=1), this gives 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by substituting k=2 up to k=9. The final value of the innermost expression is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? Let me compute each part: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think this is correct because each step built upon the previous one, and I double-checked each multiplication to ensure accuracy. It's a bit tedious, but breaking it down made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " Let me try to break it down step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving out one layer, it's 3 times that result, and then added to 1. Wait, no, let me clarify. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the inside, the innermost is (1 + 3), then the next layer out is 1 + 3*(innermost), then the next is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and so on. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that approach. Let's number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9. Wait, actually, let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count: starting from the innermost, there are nine layers because each time we have a 3 multiplying the next layer. Wait, no, let me check again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, after the first 3, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(Layer 9). So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on, down to Layer 1 being (1 + 3).\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let's start.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nSo, adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check with another method to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 =6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent each layer as a recurrence relation. Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1 for n from 2 to 9.\n\nSo, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, which is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nApplying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, L9 = (3^10 - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation formula also gives the same result, which reinforces that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a base-3 number or some pattern, but I think the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation both confirm the result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute each layer again, just to ensure no arithmetic errors:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems consistent every time. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer up to the ninth, resulting in the ninth layer being 29,524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's denote each inner expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E9 is the innermost one. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, E8 = 1 + 3(E9)\n\nE7 = 1 + 3(E8)\n\nAnd so on, until E1, which would be the outermost expression, and then the entire problem is 3 times E1. Let me confirm that: the problem is 3(E1), where E1 is 1 + 3(E2), and E2 is 1 + 3(E3), etc. So, if I compute each E from E9 up to E1, I can find the value. Let's start computing each E step by step.\n\nStarting with E9:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThat's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, E8:\n\nE8 = 1 + 3(E9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so E8 is 13. Next, E7:\n\nE7 = 1 + 3(E8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so E7 is 40. Continuing this way, E6:\n\nE6 = 1 + 3(E7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems right. Next, E5:\n\nE5 = 1 + 3(E6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, moving on to E4:\n\nE4 = 1 + 3(E5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nHmm, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. That's a big number, but it's manageable. Next, E3:\n\nE3 = 1 + 3(E4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, 3*1093: let me check that multiplication. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nNow, E2:\n\nE2 = 1 + 3(E3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLet me verify 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. That's correct.\n\nFinally, E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3(E2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3*9841: Let me calculate that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(E1), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Now, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7     3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier steps because that's a lot of computation. Let me go through each E again to confirm.\n\nE9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nE1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe there's a pattern here. Each E seems to be following a certain sequence. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each step, just to confirm.\n\nLooking at the structure, each E is defined as E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}, starting from E9 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, each E is built from the next one, so E8 = 1 + 3*E9, E7 = 1 + 3*E8, etc. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nLet me consider the general form. Suppose we have E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}, and we know E9 = 4. Then, E8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, E7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nThis seems like each term is 3 times the previous term minus something? Wait, let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Wait, but in this case, each E is 1 + 3*next E. So, it's a bit different.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express this as a recurrence relation and solve it.\n\nLet me denote E_k as the k-th term, starting from E9.\n\nGiven that E9 = 4.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is E_{k} = 1 + 3*E_{k+1}, with E9 = 4.\n\nWe can model this as a linear recurrence. Let's try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is E_{k} - 3*E_{k+1} = 0, which can be rewritten as E_{k} = 3*E_{k+1}.\n\nWait, but that's not standard because usually, we have E_{k+1} in terms of E_k. Let me adjust the indices.\n\nLet me consider E_{k} = 1 + 3*E_{k+1}.\n\nLet me rearrange this as E_{k+1} = (E_k - 1)/3.\n\nThat's a linear recurrence, but it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term -1/3.\n\nThe standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_{k+1} = (E_k)/3.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r = 1/3, so the homogeneous solution is E^{(h)}_k = C*(1/3)^k.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (-1/3), we can assume a constant particular solution E^{(p)}_k = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = (A - 1)/3\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n3A = A - 1\n\n3A - A = -1\n\n2A = -1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_k = C*(1/3)^k + (-1/2)\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. Wait, but in our case, the initial condition is E9 = 4.\n\nSo, when k = 9, E_9 = 4.\n\nThus, 4 = C*(1/3)^9 + (-1/2)\n\nLet me solve for C:\n\nC*(1/3)^9 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, C = (9/2) * (3)^9\n\nCompute (3)^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, C = (9/2)*19683 = (9*19683)/2\n\nCompute 9*19683:\n\n19683 * 9:\n\nCompute 19683 * 10 = 196830\n\nSubtract 19683: 196830 - 19683 = 177147\n\nSo, C = 177147 / 2 = 88573.5\n\nWait, but that seems odd because our initial condition is at k=9, and E_k is an integer for all k from 9 upwards. So, having a fractional C might not make sense here. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, let's check the particular solution again. I assumed E^{(p)}_k = A, a constant. Let me substitute back into the recurrence:\n\nE^{(p)}_{k+1} = (E^{(p)}_k - 1)/3\n\nIf E^{(p)}_k = A, then:\n\nA = (A - 1)/3\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n3A = A - 1\n\n2A = -1 => A = -1/2\n\nThat seems correct. So, the particular solution is -1/2.\n\nThen, the general solution is E_k = C*(1/3)^k - 1/2\n\nApplying E9 = 4:\n\n4 = C*(1/3)^9 - 1/2\n\nSo, C*(1/3)^9 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2) * 3^9 = (9/2)*19683 = (9*19683)/2 = 177147/2 = 88573.5\n\nHmm, but 88573.5 is a fractional coefficient, which when multiplied by (1/3)^k would give a fractional term. But our E_k's are all integers, so perhaps this approach isn't the best here, or maybe I made a mistake in setting up the recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model it differently. Let's consider that each E_k is 1 + 3*E_{k+1}, and we have 9 layers. So, starting from E9 = 4, and going up to E1, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express E1 as a sum involving powers of 3. Let me try expanding E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nBut E2 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*E3\n\nSimilarly, E3 = 1 + 3*E4, so:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*E4) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*E4\n\nContinuing this way, each time expanding the innermost term:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8*E9\n\nSince E9 = 4, we can write:\n\nE1 = (1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8) + 3^9*4\n\nNow, the sum 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8 is a geometric series with ratio 3 and 9 terms (from 3^0 to 3^8). The sum of a geometric series is (r^n - 1)/(r - 1). So, sum = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nSo, E1 = 9841 + 3^9*4 = 9841 + 19683*4.\n\nWait, 19683*4: let's compute that.\n\n19683 * 4:\n\n19683 * 2 = 39366\n\n39366 * 2 = 78732\n\nSo, 19683*4 = 78732.\n\nThus, E1 = 9841 + 78732 = 88573\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed E1 step by step, I got E1 = 29524. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, no, actually, let's see. If E1 is 1 + 3*E2, and E2 is 1 + 3*E3, etc., up to E9 = 4, then the expansion I did above is correct. So, perhaps my step-by-step computation was wrong.\n\nWait, let me check the step-by-step computation again.\n\nStarting from E9 = 4.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so according to this, E1 = 29524, but according to the geometric series approach, E1 = 88573. There's a conflict here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the geometric series approach. Let me go back.\n\nI wrote E1 as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9*4.\n\nBut actually, when I expand E1, each step adds another term, but perhaps the number of terms is different.\n\nWait, let's try expanding E1 step by step using the recursive formula.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*E3\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*E4) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*E4\n\nContinuing this way, each time we expand, we add another term.\n\nSince there are 9 layers from E1 to E9, E1 will have 9 terms in the expansion.\n\nWait, but E9 is 4, which is 1 + 3, so perhaps the expansion is:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9*(1 + 3)\n\nWait, because E9 = 1 + 3*E10, but E10 doesn't exist here; E9 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3, so E9 = 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of E1 as:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nWith nine 1's and nine 3's. So, the expansion would have terms 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9*(1 + 3). Wait, but 1 + 3 is 4, so 3^9*4.\n\nThus, E1 = sum_{k=0}^8 3^k + 3^9*4\n\nWhich is the same as before: sum = (3^9 - 1)/2 + 3^9*4\n\nWait, so sum = (19683 - 1)/2 + 19683*4 = 19682/2 + 78732 = 9841 + 78732 = 88573\n\nBut according to the step-by-step computation, E1 = 29524. So, there's a contradiction. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nThe original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. Up to the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, each 1 + 3(...) is a separate layer, so from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. So, E9 is the innermost, and E1 is the outermost. Therefore, when I expanded E1, I should have 9 terms, each with a power of 3 up to 3^8, plus 3^9*E9, which is 3^9*4.\n\nBut when I computed E1 step by-step, I got 29524, but according to the expansion, it should be 88573. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps my step-by-step computation was wrong. Let me go through it again.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so according to this, E1 = 29524, but according to the expansion, it's 88573. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion approach. Let me try computing E1 using the expansion:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9*4\n\nCompute each term:\n\n3^0 = 1\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, sum from 3^0 to 3^8 is (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841\n\nThen, 3^9*4 = 19683*4 = 78732\n\nSo, E1 = 9841 + 78732 = 88573\n\nBut according to step-by-step, E1 = 29524. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the expansion. Let me check the step-by-step computation again.\n\nWait, in the step-by-step, E1 is computed as 1 + 3*E2, where E2 = 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. But according to the expansion, E1 is 88573. There's a clear discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the expansion. Let me think again. When expanding E1, each time I expand, I should get an additional term. Let me try to write E1 in terms of E9.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*E3\n\nSimilarly, E3 = 1 + 3*E4, so:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*E4) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*E4\n\nContinuing this way, each substitution adds another term, so after 9 substitutions, we'd have:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9*E9\n\nSince E9 = 4, that's:\n\nE1 = (3^9 - 1)/2 + 3^9*4\n\nWhich is 9841 + 78732 = 88573\n\nBut in the step-by-step, I get E1 = 29524. So, clearly, one of these is wrong. Let me check where.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of terms. Let me count the number of layers again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. Up to the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, each 1 + 3(...) is a layer, so from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. So, E9 is the innermost, and E1 is the outermost, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nBut in the step-by-step computation, I computed E1 as 29524, but according to the expansion, it's 88573. There's a problem here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation. Let me check E2 again.\n\nE9 = 4\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so according to this, E1 = 29524, but according to the expansion, it's 88573. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion approach. Let me try computing E1 using both methods.\n\nWait, let me compute E1 using the expansion:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9*4\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\n4 + 9 = 13\n\n13 + 27 = 40\n\n40 + 81 = 121\n\n121 + 243 = 364\n\n364 + 729 = 1093\n\n1093 + 2187 = 3280\n\n3280 + 6561 = 9841\n\n9841 + 19683*4 = 9841 + 78732 = 88573\n\nWait, but in the step-by-step, E1 is 29524, which is much smaller. So, perhaps the expansion approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the expansion. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when I expand E1, I'm getting E1 = sum_{k=0}^8 3^k + 3^9*E9, but in reality, each substitution should only go up to E9, which is 4.\n\nBut in the step-by-step, E1 is built up as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each step adds another layer, but in the expansion, I'm adding all the terms up to 3^8, plus 3^9*E9.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct expansion is E1 = sum_{k=0}^8 3^k + 3^9*E9\n\nWhich would be (3^9 - 1)/2 + 3^9*E9\n\nBut E9 is 4, so:\n\n(19683 - 1)/2 + 19683*4 = 9841 + 78732 = 88573\n\nBut according to the step-by-step, E1 is 29524, which is way smaller. So, perhaps the expansion approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of layers again.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach 1 + 3(...) is a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then (1 + 3(...))\n3. Each time we go out, it's another layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: the outermost (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, E1 is the outermost layer, which is 1 + 3*E2, and E2 is 1 + 3*E3, etc., up to E9 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the expansion approach should give E1 = sum_{k=0}^8 3^k + 3^9*E9, which is 88573, but according to the step-by-step, it's 29524. There's a problem here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion approach. Let me try a smaller example to see where I went wrong.\n\nLet's take a smaller version of the problem, say with only two layers:\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nAccording to the step-by-step method:\n\nE2 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nTotal = 3*13 = 39\n\nAccording to the expansion method:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2*E3, but E3 doesn't exist here. Wait, no, in this case, with two layers, E2 = 4, so E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches.\n\nBut using the expansion approach for two layers:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2*E3, but E3 is the innermost, which is 4. So, E1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2*4 = 4 + 9*4 = 4 + 36 = 40, which is wrong because the correct value is 13.\n\nWait, so the expansion approach is giving the wrong answer for a smaller case, which means I must have misapplied it.\n\nWait, in the two-layer case, the correct E1 is 13, but the expansion gives 40. So, my expansion approach is flawed.\n\nWait, let me try to expand E1 correctly.\n\nIn the two-layer case:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE2 = 1 + 3\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3*(4) = 13, which is correct.\n\nBut if I try to expand E1 as 1 + 3 + 3^2*E3, but E3 is 4, which is not correct because E3 doesn't exist in this case. Wait, perhaps the expansion approach is only valid when there are more layers.\n\nWait, no, in the two-layer case, E2 is the innermost, which is 4, so E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. The expansion should be:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is correct.\n\nWait, so in the two-layer case, the expansion is correct: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nWait, but in the two-layer case, the innermost is E2 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is 3^1 + 1, but in the expansion, it's 1 + 3 + 9, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the expansion in the original problem. Let me try again.\n\nIn the original problem, with nine layers, E1 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E3\n\n...\n\nE9 = 1 + 3\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))\n\nExpanding this, each time we expand, we add another term. So, for nine layers, E1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9*(1 + 3)\n\nBut 1 + 3 is 4, so E1 = sum_{k=0}^8 3^k + 3^9*4\n\nWhich is (3^9 - 1)/2 + 3^9*4\n\nWhich is 9841 + 78732 = 88573\n\nBut in the step-by-step, with nine layers, I get E1 = 29524, which is different.\n\nWait, but in the two-layer case, the expansion works correctly. So, why is there a discrepancy in the nine-layer case?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation. Let me check again.\n\nStarting with E9 = 4\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*109"

So, starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3( ) Wait, but actually, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? Because after that, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check the original expression again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, actually, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of 3s. Each time, we have a 3 multiplied by the next layer. So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. So perhaps it's a recursive-like structure where each layer depends on the next. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, that seems a bit high, but let's check. Wait, 3*13 is indeed 39, plus 1 is 40. Okay, moving on. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, that's getting big. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Wow, that's a jump. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So after computing L9, which is 29524, the total expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's do 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the total expression would be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because the numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back step by step. Starting from the innermost: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900; 60*3=180; 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080; 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, L6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000; 90*3=270; 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270; 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000; 200*3=600; 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600; 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, L8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, L9 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29,524. Let's compute that. 29,524*3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait a second, but let me think again. Each time, the layers are being multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. So, the structure is such that each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, and working outwards. Each step, we're computing the next layer by taking 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, that seems consistent. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Maybe recognizing this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. This is similar to a geometric series but nested. Let me see if I can express it recursively. Let\u2019s define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, in this case, the innermost layer is f(1) = 4, then f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, the total expression is 3*f(9), since there are 9 layers. Wait, but in the original problem, the outermost layer is 3*(f(9)), right? Because the innermost is f(1)=4, then f(2)=13, up to f(9), and then multiplied by 3. So, the total expression is 3*f(9). So, if I can find a formula for f(n), that would make it easier instead of computing each layer. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for f(n). The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + C, where A is a constant determined by the initial condition, and C is a constant particular solution. Let me find C. Suppose f(n) = C is a constant solution, then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: f(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, f(9)= (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, the total expression is 3*f(9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could express the total expression as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 =3*59048/2=3*29524=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. Then, (59049 -1)=59048, divided by 2 is 29524, multiplied by 3 is 88572. Yep, that seems right. I don't see any errors in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)  \n...  \nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)  \nAnd finally, the entire expression is 3(Layer 9). \n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the expression starts with 3 times (1 + 3 times something). So maybe the layers are a bit different. Let me count how many times 3 is multiplied. Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So perhaps there are eight layers inside the initial 3(...). Let me check: the innermost is (1 + 3), then each time we go out, we have another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, actually, there are nine layers. But the expression is 3*(layer 9), where layer 9 is 1 + 3*(layer 8), and so on down to layer 1, which is 1 + 3. Hmm, that seems correct. So, to compute this, I should start from layer 1 and work my way up to layer 9, then multiply by 3. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:  \nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nSo, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. So, adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the final result should be 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify my calculations because I might have made an error somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to check for any mistakes.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000 + 279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000 + 2400=29400, +123=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again. 29524*3:\n\nCompute 29524*3:\n- 20000*3=60000\n- 9000*3=27000\n- 500*3=1500\n- 20*3=60\n- 4*3=12\n\nNow, add them together:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I was computing each layer, I assumed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). But looking back at the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(...), and finally, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, my approach was correct because I computed each layer starting from the innermost, which is layer 1, up to layer 9, and then multiplied by 3. So, I think my answer is right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a pattern.\n\nLet's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the sequence goes 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nLooking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find a recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B = right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me start computing each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12; adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9; adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840; adding them gives 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3; adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses.

Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, the outermost expression is 3*(something), where that something is Layer 9. Hmm, so maybe I should compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2 using Layer 1, and so on, until I get to Layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3. Let me try that approach. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.

Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12.

Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThis seems to follow the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nI can try to find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me write it as:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is L_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so L_9 is (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*59048/2= (3/2)*59048.\n\nCompute 59048 divided by 2: 59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 29524*3=88572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with each layer. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step or use a closed-form formula. \n\nUsing the closed-form solution for the nth layer, \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), we find the outermost layer (n=9) to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, actually, looking again, the expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, perhaps there are 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Hmm, actually, no. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.

Wait, so that's 9 layers? Or maybe 8? Because the innermost is just 1 + 3, without another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer. So starting from the first one, that's 1, then each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let me see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, from the first 3, it's 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and that continues until the innermost part, which is 1 + 3). So, how many layers is that?

The original expression is 3*(...), where the ... is up to Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that because it's easy to make a mistake in counting the layers or in the multiplication. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miscount. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1: 4\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for such nested expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and this repeats multiple times, it might be a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about that. Suppose we have a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. So, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + particular solution.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolve for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the Layer 9 result we got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we also get 88572, which confirms our earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to ensure I didn't make a mistake there. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can also compute the entire expression using the formula for a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit different. The closed-form we derived seems appropriate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, starting from 1. Wait, no, actually, starting from 1 + 3*... So, it's a bit different. But regardless, the recurrence relation approach worked well.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let's define each inner expression as follows: Let\u2019s say E1 is the innermost expression: E1 = 1 + 3 Then, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 E3 = 1 + 3*E2 ... and so on, up to E9, since there are nine layers. Wait, actually, looking back at the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is multiplied by 3 after the innermost one. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost 1 + 3 and work my way out, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me try that approach. So, starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(E1). So, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Next layer out: E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Then, E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3*(E9). So, let's compute that: 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, but let me double-check that because the original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which we just computed as E9 = 29524. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way because each step builds on the previous one, and a small mistake early on could throw off the entire result. Let me go through each step again to verify.\n\nStarting with E1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*E9 = 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3. Break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might be a bit messy. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12.

    "text": " Let me try that. Let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, (1 + 3) = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from the innermost layer)). Since the innermost was 4, this next layer would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, and then 1 + 12 = 13. So, that layer gives me 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from the previous layer)). The previous result was 13, so this would be 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, and then 1 + 39 = 40. So, this layer is 40. Hmm, so each time I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. Let me see if this pattern continues. The next layer would be (1 + 3*40). Calculating that: 3*40 = 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121. Next layer: (1 + 3*121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, 364. Next layer: (1 + 3*364). Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Okay, so that's 1093. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093). Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, that's 3280. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280). Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, that's 9841. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841). Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that's 29524. Now, moving to the outermost layer: (1 + 3*29524). Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9524*3: Let me break that down. 9000*3=27000, 524*3=1572. So, 27000 + 1572 = 28572. Then, adding that to 60000: 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Now, add 1: 1 + 88572 = 88573. So, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is 88573. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times that. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Wait, no, that's breaking it down wrong. Let me do it correctly. 88573 * 3. Let me compute digit by digit:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n\n3*5 = 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n\n3*8 = 24, plus the carried 1 is 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n\n3*8 = 24, plus the carried 2 is 26, write down 6, carry over 2\n\nBut wait, 88573 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it as 8 8 5 7 3.\n\nSo, starting from the right:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write 1, carry 2\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2\n\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carry 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carried 2.\n\nSo, the result is 265719.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n88573 * 3:\n\nFirst, 3*3=9\n\n3*7=21, write 1, carry 2\n\n3*5=15 + 2=17, write 7, carry 1\n\n3*8=24 + 1=25, write 5, carry 2\n\n3*8=24 + 2=26, write 6, carry 2\n\nThen, since there are no more digits, write 2.\n\nSo, the number is 265719.

Alternatively, 88573 * 3 can be computed as (80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3) * 3 = 240000 + 24000 + 1500 + 210 + 9 = 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719.

    "text": " Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost parentheses first. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so I can replace the innermost parentheses with 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me keep going. Next layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, that's 121. Next: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(previous result). So, 3*88573.

Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Next, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Finally, 3*88573 = 265719. Hmm, so that seems correct. But I feel like such a large number might not be accurate because the problem didn't seem that complex, but maybe it is. Let me check each step again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct. Next layer: 1 + 3*4. 3*4=12, 1+12=13. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*13. 3*13=39, 1+39=40. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*40. 3*40=120, 1+120=121. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*121. 3*121=363, 1+363=364. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*364. 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1+1092=1093. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 1+3279=3280. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 1+29523=29524. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*29524. 29524*3: Let's compute this carefully. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. Then, 1+88572=88573. Correct. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*88573. Let's compute that again. 88573*3: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding these: 240000+24000=264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 265,719. I think I did that correctly. Each step built upon the previous one, and I checked each multiplication carefully. So, even though the number seems large, the process seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, starting with the innermost (1 + 3) and proceeding outward. After computing each layer, the result is used in the next outer layer. This process continues until the entire expression is simplified, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{265719}$"

    "text": " Let me try that. Let's label each layer from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. Wait, actually, starting from the innermost, that would be Layer 1, and each subsequent layer wraps around it. So, the innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then, Layer 2 wraps around that: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 wraps around Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1, then Layer 2, etc., I can build up the solution. Let me try that approach. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That seems straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 times the outermost (1 + ...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. Let me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Each step follows logically, and I don't see any arithmetic errors upon reviewing.

Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, interesting. Let's do Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... Let me calculate that. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093. So, 3*1093. Let me compute that. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280. So, 3*3280. Let me compute that. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841. So, 3*9841. Let me calculate that. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524.

Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.

Let me verify that multiplication. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down digit by digit:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15.

Wait, let me count the digits correctly: 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7, carryover 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place: 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten thousands place: 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.

    "text": " Let me number the layers from the inside out. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one out is Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is (1 + 3). Layer 2 is 3 times (1 + 3 times Layer 1). Layer 3 is 3 times (1 + 3 times Layer 2). And this pattern continues up to Layer 9, which is the outermost part. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 3 times (1 + 3 times Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, let's compute that: Layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 3*(1 + 3*Layer 2). Layer 2 is 39, so: Layer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 3*Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189. Wow, that's a jump. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 3*Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704. That's a pretty big number. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 3*Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339. Okay, this is getting huge. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 3*Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 3*Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489. Wow, that's massive. Layer 9: 3*(1 + 3*Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404. Wait a second, that seems really large. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: (1+3)=4. Correct. Layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4)=3*(1+12)=3*13=39. Correct. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39)=3*(1+117)=3*118=354. Correct. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354)=3*(1+1062)=3*1063=3189. Correct. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189)=3*(1+9567)=3*9568=28704. Correct. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28704)=3*(1+86112)=3*86113=258339. Correct. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258339)=3*(1+775017)=3*775018=2325054. Correct. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054)=3*(1+6975162)=3*6975163=20925489. Correct. Layer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20925489)=3*(1+62776467)=3*62776468=188329404. Hmm, seems consistent. So, according to this, the value of the entire expression is 188,329,404. But wait, that feels a bit too large. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original problem has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, Layer 1 is the innermost (1+3), and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, I think I did count them correctly, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: each term is 3*(1 + 3*previous term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}). That's a recursive formula. Let me write that down: a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}) with a_1 = 4. So, if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might save me time. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be written as: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 3. Solving for K: K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_h + a_p = C*3^n - 3/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1 into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 \u2248 1.8333. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. Let me simplify this. (11/6)*3^n can be written as (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n. Alternatively, since 3^n = 3*3^{n-1}, but maybe it's better to compute it as is. Let me compute a_n for n=9 using this formula. a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2. First, compute 3^9. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So, 3^9=19683. Then, (11/6)*19683. Let's compute that. 19683 divided by 6 is 3280.5, then multiplied by 11: 3280.5 * 11. Let me compute 3280.5 * 10 = 32805, plus 3280.5 = 36085.5. So, (11/6)*19683 = 36085.5. Now, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. So, a_9 = 36084. Wait, that's different from what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Earlier, I got 188,329,404, but according to this formula, it's 36,084. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my earlier calculations. Wait, no, I think I messed up the initial condition. Let me go back to the recurrence relation. The original recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}). So, a_n = 3 + 9*a_{n-1}. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, no: 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}) = 3*1 + 3*3*a_{n-1} = 3 + 9*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence is a_n = 9*a_{n-1} + 3. Hmm, that's different from what I had before. Earlier, I thought it was a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, but actually, it's a_n = 9*a_{n-1} + 3. That's a crucial mistake. So, my previous approach was incorrect because I miswrote the recurrence relation. Let me correct that. The correct recurrence is a_n = 9*a_{n-1} + 3. So, now, let's solve this recurrence properly. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 9*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 9 = 0, so r=9. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_h = C*9^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 9*K + 3. Solving for K: K - 9K = 3 => -8K = 3 => K = -3/8. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*9^n - 3/8. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*9^1 - 3/8 => 4 = 9C - 0.375 => 9C = 4 + 0.375 = 4.375 => C = 4.375 / 9. Let's compute that. 4.375 divided by 9. 4.375 / 9 = (35/8)/9 = 35/(8*9) = 35/72 \u2248 0.4861. So, C = 35/72. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8. Let's simplify this. (35/72)*9^n can be written as (35/72)*9^n. Alternatively, note that 9^n = (9)^n, so we can write it as (35/72)*(9^n). Let me compute a_9 using this formula. a_9 = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8. First, compute 9^9. 9^1=9, 9^2=81, 9^3=729, 9^4=6561, 9^5=59049, 9^6=531441, 9^7=4782969, 9^8=43046721, 9^9=387420489. So, 9^9=387,420,489. Now, (35/72)*387,420,489. Let me compute that. First, compute 387,420,489 divided by 72. Let's see, 72*5,000,000=360,000,000. Subtract that from 387,420,489: 387,420,489 - 360,000,000 = 27,420,489. Now, 72*380,000=27,360,000. Subtract that: 27,420,489 - 27,360,000 = 60,489. Now, 72*839=60,489 (since 72*800=57,600, 72*39=2,808; 57,600+2,808=60,408; wait, that's 60,408, which is 81 less than 60,489). Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute 387,420,489 /72. Let me use a calculator approach. 72*5,380,000=72*5,000,000=360,000,000; 72*380,000=27,360,000; total so far: 360,000,000 +27,360,000=387,360,000. Subtract from 387,420,489: 387,420,489 - 387,360,000=60,489. Now, 72*839=60,408 as before. So, 72*5,380,839=387,420,489. Therefore, 387,420,489 /72=5,380,839. So, (35/72)*387,420,489=35*5,380,839. Now, compute 35*5,380,839. Let's break it down: 35*5,000,000=175,000,000; 35*380,839= let's compute 35*300,000=10,500,000; 35*80,839= let's compute 35*80,000=2,800,000; 35*839=35*(800+39)=35*800=28,000 +35*39=1,365=28,000+1,365=29,365. So, adding up: 2,800,000 +29,365=2,829,365. Then, 10,500,000 +2,829,365=13,329,365. Now, total 35*5,380,839=175,000,000 +13,329,365=188,329,365. So, (35/72)*9^9=188,329,365. Now, subtract 3/8: 188,329,365 - 3/8. 3/8=0.375, so 188,329,365 -0.375=188,329,364.625. But since we're dealing with integers in the original problem, the decimal part must come from the subtraction. Wait, but in reality, the particular solution was K=-3/8, so when we subtract 3/8, it's a fractional number, but our original problem is built with integers. However, in our earlier step-by-step computation, we ended up with an integer, 188,329,404, which is close to this value. Wait, but according to the closed-form formula, it's 188,329,364.625, which is not an integer, but our step-by-step gave us 188,329,404. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check my step-by-step computation again to see where I went wrong. Let's go back to the step-by-step:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)=4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4)=3*(1+12)=3*13=39.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39)=3*(1+117)=3*118=354.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354)=3*(1+1062)=3*1063=3189.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189)=3*(1+9567)=3*9568=28704.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28704)=3*(1+86112)=3*86113=258339.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258339)=3*(1+775017)=3*775018=2325054.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054)=3*(1+6975162)=3*6975163=20925489.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20925489)=3*(1+62776467)=3*62776468=188329404.\n\nWait, so according to the step-by-step, Layer 9 is 188,329,404, but according to the closed-form formula, it's 188,329,364.625. The difference is 188,329,404 - 188,329,364.625 = 39.375. Hmm, that's exactly 39.375, which is 39 and 3/8, which is 315/8. Wait, that's interesting because in the closed-form, we have -3/8, so maybe the discrepancy is due to the way the initial condition was applied. Let me check the closed-form formula again. The general solution was a_n = C*9^n - 3/8. Then, applying a_1=4: 4 = C*9 - 3/8 => C = (4 + 3/8)/9 = (35/8)/9 = 35/72. So, a_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8. Let me compute a_9: (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8. As above, 9^9=387,420,489. 35/72 * 387,420,489 = 188,329,365. Then, subtract 3/8: 188,329,365 - 0.375 = 188,329,364.625. But in the step-by-step, we have 188,329,404. The difference is 39.375, which is 315/8. Wait, but 315/8 is 39.375. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation. Let me check Layer 9 again. Layer 9 is 3*(1 + 3*Layer 8). Layer 8 was 20,925,489. So, 3*Layer 8 = 3*20,925,489 = 62,776,467. Then, 1 + 62,776,467 = 62,776,468. Then, 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404. That seems correct. So, according to the step-by-step, it's 188,329,404, but according to the formula, it's 188,329,364.625. There's a discrepancy of 39.375. That suggests that either the formula is incorrect or the step-by-step has an error. Wait, but the formula was derived correctly. Let me check the recurrence relation again. The original recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}) = 3 + 9*a_{n-1}. So, a_n = 9*a_{n-1} + 3. So, the recurrence is correct. The general solution was a_n = C*9^n - 3/8. With a_1=4, we have 4 = C*9 - 3/8 => C = (4 + 3/8)/9 = (35/8)/9 = 35/72. Therefore, a_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8. So, a_9 = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8 = 188,329,365 - 0.375 = 188,329,364.625. But according to the step-by-step, it's 188,329,404, which is 39.375 more. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the step-by-step is correct and the formula is missing something. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the initial condition. Let me check the initial condition. The innermost layer is Layer 1: (1+3)=4. So, a_1=4. Then, a_2=3*(1 + 3*4)=39. a_3=3*(1 + 3*39)=354. Let me compute a_2 using the formula: a_2 = (35/72)*9^2 - 3/8. 9^2=81. So, (35/72)*81 = (35*81)/72. 81 divided by 72 is 1.125. 35*1.125=39.375. Then, subtract 3/8=0.375: 39.375 -0.375=39. So, a_2=39, which matches the step-by-step. Similarly, a_3=(35/72)*9^3 -3/8. 9^3=729. (35/72)*729=35*(729/72)=35*(10.125)=354.375. Subtract 0.375: 354.375 -0.375=354. So, a_3=354, which matches. Similarly, a_4=(35/72)*9^4 -3/8. 9^4=6561. (35/72)*6561=35*(6561/72)=35*(91.125)=35*91.125=35*90=3150 +35*1.125=39.375=3150+39.375=3189.375. Subtract 0.375: 3189.375 -0.375=3189, which matches. So, the formula works for a_2, a_3, a_4, etc. So, why is there a discrepancy at a_9? Let me compute a_9 using the formula more carefully. a_9=(35/72)*9^9 -3/8. 9^9=387,420,489. (35/72)*387,420,489=35*(387,420,489/72). Let's compute 387,420,489 divided by 72. 72*5,000,000=360,000,000. 387,420,489 -360,000,000=27,420,489. 72*380,000=27,360,000. 27,420,489 -27,360,000=60,489. 72*839=60,408. 60,489 -60,408=81. 72*1=72. 81-72=9. So, total is 5,000,000 +380,000 +839 +1=5,380,840. But we have a remainder of 9, so it's 5,380,840 + 9/72=5,380,840 + 1/8=5,380,840.125. Therefore, 387,420,489 /72=5,380,840.125. Then, multiply by 35: 5,380,840.125 *35. Let's compute 5,380,840 *35: 5,380,840*30=161,425,200; 5,380,840*5=26,904,200. Total=161,425,200 +26,904,200=188,329,400. Then, 0.125*35=4.375. So, total is 188,329,400 +4.375=188,329,404.375. Now, subtract 3/8=0.375: 188,329,404.375 -0.375=188,329,404. So, a_9=188,329,404, which matches the step-by-step computation. Wait, so earlier I thought the formula gave 188,329,364.625, but actually, when computed correctly, it's 188,329,404. So, my earlier mistake was in the calculation of (35/72)*9^9. I must have miscalculated that part. So, the correct value is indeed 188,329,404, which matches both the step-by-step and the formula. Therefore, the final answer is 188,329,404. So, after correcting the formula application, both methods agree. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 3 times (1 plus 3 times the next nested term). By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each step as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 4) = 39\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 39) = 354\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 354) = 3189\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 3189) = 28704\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 28704) = 258339\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 258339) = 2325054\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 2325054) = 20925489\\)\n9. Outermost layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 20925489) = 188329404\\)\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{188329404}\\)."

    "text": " Let me denote each layer as follows to keep track: Let\u2019s say the innermost part is Layer 1: (1 + 3) Then Layer 2 would be: 3(1 + 3) But wait, no, actually, each layer is 3 times (1 + 3 times the next layer). So maybe it's better to think of each layer as a function that depends on the previous one. Let me try to define it recursively. Let\u2019s let a_n represent the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 a_2, a_2 = 1 + 3 a_3, and so on, until a_9 = 1 + 3. Wait, no, that might not be the right way. Actually, looking at the expression, each a_i is 1 + 3 times the next a_{i+1}. So, starting from the innermost, which is a_9: a_9 = 1 + 3. Then, a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9, a_7 = 1 + 3*a_8, and so on until a_1. Finally, the entire expression is 3*a_1. So, to compute this, I need to compute a_9 first, then a_8 using a_9, then a_7 using a_8, and so on, all the way up to a_1, and then multiply that by 3. That seems manageable. Let me start computing each layer step by step. Starting with a_9: a_9 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that was simple. Now, moving to a_8: a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Next, a_7 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, getting bigger. Then, a_6 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, that's growing quickly. Let me keep going. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*a_1, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, maybe it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let's do that: 29524 * 3. 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9*3 = 27. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carry-over. Let me write it out step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Okay, that seems right. So the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses, I computed each layer step by step, each time substituting the value of the next layer into the current one. I went from a_9 up to a_1, then multiplied a_1 by 3. Each step involved multiplying the previous layer's value by 3 and adding 1. Let me verify a couple of the intermediate steps to ensure accuracy.\n\nStarting with a_9 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a_1 = 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nI think that's all correct. Each step seems to check out, so I feel confident that 88572 is the right answer. It's interesting how each layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1, leading to exponential growth. It makes sense that the numbers get so big so quickly. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression without having to compute each layer manually. Maybe something like a geometric series or a recurrence relation? Let me think about that for a second.\n\nIn this case, each a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i+1}, with a_9 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_i. Let me try to see the pattern. Starting from a_9:\n\na_9 = 4\na_8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_6 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I notice that each term is roughly 4 times the previous term minus something. Let me check:\n\na_8 = 13, which is 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, 13 = 3*4 +1.\n\nSimilarly, a_7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, 40 = 3*13 +1.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nIt's clear that each term is 3 times the next term plus 1. So, the recurrence relation is a_i = 3*a_{i+1} +1, with a_9 =4. Alternatively, if we consider the sequence in reverse, starting from a_1, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using characteristic equations or something, but that might be overcomplicating things for this problem since we only have nine layers. However, it's an interesting observation. So, in general, for such expressions with n layers, the value would grow exponentially, specifically following a pattern similar to 3^n. But in this case, since we have a specific number of layers, computing each step manually was feasible.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer adds another factor of 3. So, the innermost layer is 4, then each subsequent layer is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, it's like 4, 13 (which is 3*4 +1), 40 (which is 3*13 +1), and so on. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the nth term can be expressed as (3^{n} -1)/2, but let me check if that holds.\n\nWait, let me test that formula with the known values. Let's say n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1. But a_9 is 4, so maybe the formula is offset. Let me see. If I consider that a_9 corresponds to n=1, then maybe a_i = (3^{i-8} -1)/2 + something. Hmm, perhaps not the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the general solution is a_i = (3^{9 - i +1} -1)/2. Let's test for i=9: (3^{1} -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1, but a_9 is 4. So that doesn't fit. Maybe I need to adjust the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is a_i = (3^{k} -1)/2, where k is the number of layers from that point. For example, a_9 has 1 layer, so (3^1 +1)=4? Wait, (3^1 +1)=4, which matches a_9=4. Then, a_8 would be (3^2 +1)=10, but a_8 is 13, so that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Each a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i+1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation of the form a_i = 3*a_{i+1} +1. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nAssuming that the recurrence is a_i = 3*a_{i+1} +1, with a_9 =4. Let me reverse the indices to make it easier. Let me let b_k = a_{10 -k}, so that b_1 = a_9=4, and the recurrence becomes b_k = 1 + 3*b_{k-1}, with b_1=4.\n\nNow, this is a standard linear recurrence: b_k - 3*b_{k-1} =1. The homogeneous solution is b_k^h = C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume b_k^p = A. Plugging into the equation: A -3*A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is b_k = C*3^k -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition: b_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, b_k= (3/2)*3^k -1/2= (3^{k+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, b_k= (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Since b_k= a_{10 -k}, then a_i= b_{10 -i}= (3^{10 -i +1} -1)/2= (3^{11 -i} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for i=1, a_1= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation of a_1=29524. Perfect! So, the formula is a_i= (3^{11 -i} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_1=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Which matches our earlier result. So, using the formula, we can compute the result directly without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's pretty cool. It's always nice when a pattern can be expressed with a formula, especially when dealing with nested expressions like this.\n\nSo, to summarize, by recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, we can find a closed-form expression for a_i, which allows us to compute the result more efficiently, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually was manageable, though time-consuming.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. It's always good to cross-verify using different methods to ensure that the result is accurate. In this case, both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula gave the same result, so I feel even more certain that it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the next term. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. \n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let's label each layer for clarity. Let me define a sequence where each term corresponds to a layer. Let's say: Let\u2019s define a sequence where a\u2081 is the innermost expression, and then each subsequent a\u2082, a\u2083, up to a\u2089 is built upon the previous one. So, starting from the innermost part: a\u2081 = 1 + 3. Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081. Then, a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082, and so on, until a\u2089. Then, the entire expression is 3a\u2089. That seems like a good plan. Let me write that down:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3  \na\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081  \na\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082  \na\u2084 = 1 + 3a\u2083  \na\u2085 = 1 + 3a\u2084  \na\u2086 = 1 + 3a\u2085  \na\u2087 = 1 + 3a\u2086  \na\u2088 = 1 + 3a\u2087  \na\u2089 = 1 + 3a\u2088  \nFinal result = 3a\u2089\n\nOkay, so now I can compute each a\u2081 through a\u2089 step by step. Let me compute each one.\n\nStarting with a\u2081:  \na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081. Since a\u2081 is 4, then:  \na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082. a\u2082 is 13, so:  \na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, a\u2084 = 1 + 3a\u2083. a\u2083 is 40, so:  \na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nMoving on to a\u2085 = 1 + 3a\u2084. a\u2084 is 121:  \na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext, a\u2086 = 1 + 3a\u2085. a\u2085 is 364:  \na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nThen, a\u2087 = 1 + 3a\u2086. a\u2086 is 1093:  \na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext, a\u2088 = 1 + 3a\u2087. a\u2087 is 3280:  \na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nFinally, a\u2089 = 1 + 3a\u2088. a\u2088 is 9841:  \na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3a\u2089, so let's compute that:  \nFinal result = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWait, let me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000  \nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000  \n500 * 3 = 1500  \n20 * 3 = 60  \n4 * 3 = 12  \nAdding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because 29524 * 3 might not be 88572. Let me compute it step by step.\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n---------  \nStarting from the right:  \n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.  \n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.  \n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.  \nSo, reading the result from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88572. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another method. Let's break down 29524 into 29000 + 524.  \n29000 * 3 = 87000  \n524 * 3 = 1572  \nAdding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing a\u2081 through a\u2089. Let me go through each step again.\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, all steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a\u2099 instead of computing each term step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nThe recurrence is a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a\u2099 - 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a\u2099 = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C  \nC - 3C = 1  \n-2C = 1  \nC = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a\u2081 = A*3\u00b9 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4  \nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms.\n\nFor n=1: a\u2081 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a\u2082 = (3\u00b3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a\u2083 = (3\u2074 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a\u2084 = (3\u2075 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: a\u2085 = (3\u2076 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works for the first few terms. Therefore, we can trust it.\n\nSince we have a\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^{10} is 59049. So, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result now. It was a bit tedious computing each a\u2099 step by step, but verifying with the closed-form formula helped ensure that I didn't make any mistakes along the way. It's interesting how these nested expressions can be tackled either by iterative computation or by finding a general formula. In this case, since the number of layers was manageable (only nine), both methods were feasible, but for more layers, the formula would definitely be more efficient.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is that each a\u2099 is growing exponentially because of the factor of 3 each time. That makes sense because each term depends on the previous one multiplied by 3, leading to a rapid increase. So, even though we started with a small number like 4, after nine iterations, it balloons into 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 gives over 88,000. It's a good reminder of how exponential growth can quickly lead to large numbers.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to represent this entire expression as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about expanding the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand it all the way, it's going to be a sum of terms where each term is 3 raised to some power, multiplied by 1, but I need to figure out the exact coefficients.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series would help here. Since each a\u2099 is defined as a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3, but with an added constant each time.\n\nBut since we already have a closed-form formula, maybe it's not necessary to go into that direction unless required. But it's an interesting observation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as follows:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E\u2081 = 1 + 3. Then, E\u2082 = 1 + 3E\u2081, E\u2083 = 1 + 3E\u2082, and so on, up to E\u2089. Then, the entire expression is 3E\u2089. So, it's the same as the a\u2099 terms I defined earlier.\n\nSo, whether I call them a\u2081 through a\u2089 or E\u2081 through E\u2089, the approach is the same.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead to the same result, so I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and define a sequence a\u2099 where each term builds on the previous one.\n\n2. Compute each term step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n3. Verify the computations by using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation.\n\n4. Confirm that both methods yield the same result.\n\n5. Reflect on the exponential growth of the terms and consider alternative approaches, such as geometric series, though in this case, the recurrence method sufficed.\n\nSo, after all that, I think I'm certain that the answer is 88572. It was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and applying recurrence relations. It also highlighted the importance of checking work through alternative methods to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with repetitive computations that can be prone to arithmetic errors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by recognizing the repeating pattern and define a sequence \\(a_n\\) where each term builds on the previous one.

    "text": " Let me number the layers from the inside out for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression. So, I'll compute each layer step by step. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 3*29524. Let's break it down differently: 29524 * 3. 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
