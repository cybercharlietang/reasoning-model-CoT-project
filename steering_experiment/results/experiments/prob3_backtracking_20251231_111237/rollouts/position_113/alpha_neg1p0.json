Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct.

Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me check: The innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1 = 4. Then Layer 2 is a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to Layer 9. So, a_9 would be the value at the 9th layer, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.
