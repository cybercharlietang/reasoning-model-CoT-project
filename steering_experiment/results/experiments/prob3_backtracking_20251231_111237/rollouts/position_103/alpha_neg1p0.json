Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer.

Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches our earlier computation. Similarly, Layer 2 would be a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13, which also matches. So, this formula seems correct. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches our earlier computation. Then layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, which also matches.

    "text": " A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches my earlier calculation. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which also matches. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would correspond to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049; 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any arithmetic errors. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). After computing each layer up to the 9th, I get 29524. Multiply that by 3 to get the final result: 88572. Alternatively, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I find that the expression simplifies to (3^{11} - 3)/2, which is 88572. So, both methods confirm the same answer.

Therefore, equate coefficients: For 3^n: A = A, which is always true. For constants: B = 3B + 1. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.

Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.

Just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but it's finite. The expansion would be a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}. Wait, no, because each term is multiplied by 3, so actually, the expansion would be a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}. But that's a geometric series with sum (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly what we got earlier. So, for n=9, the sum is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k). Wait, but no, because each layer is nested, not summed directly. But since each a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that's (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to get the same answer. Therefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation, or recognizing the geometric series pattern\u2014we arrive at the same result.

Let me check this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For Layer 1 (n=1): (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2 (n=2): (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3 (n=3): (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4 (n=4): (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression. Either way, the result is 88572. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

    "text": " A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, LHS: A*3^n + B = RHS: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to check using a different method to ensure accuracy. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find each layer's value. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form solution. Using this formula, we compute the innermost layer and propagate outward, ultimately multiplying the outermost layer by 3 to obtain the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
