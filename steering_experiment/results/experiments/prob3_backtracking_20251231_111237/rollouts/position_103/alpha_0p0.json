Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

So we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works.

Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit different. However, the recurrence approach worked well here. So, to summarize, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1, leading up to the 9th layer being 29524.

Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.

Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Alternatively, using the standard multiplication method: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each until reaching the outermost layer, then multiply by 3. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to confirm the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer, a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier calculation. So, that's a good confirmation. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could save time, but since I was able to compute each layer step by step without error, that method worked too. So, after computing each layer, I arrived at 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88572.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.

Just to be thorough, let me check with another approach. Let's see, each time we're doing 1 + 3*previous, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. The formula we derived earlier is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). There are 9 layers of 1 + 3*... So, using the formula, E = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result.

For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Thus, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct again. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. But since I already have the formula, that's probably the quickest way. However, computing each layer step by step is also straightforward, especially since there are only nine layers.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1: a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. Then layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. Similarly, layer 3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the total number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost. So, the total expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but in this case, since it's a nested expression, the closed-form solution we derived earlier is more appropriate. Either way, computing each layer step by step gives the same result as using the closed-form formula.

Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our previous result. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it gives the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we compute each nested layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, set the left side equal to the right side: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I had used the formula from the start, I could have saved some computation time. But since I was computing each layer step by step, it worked out. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
