Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have messed up the carry-over. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 step by step. Let's see: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88,572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29,524 * 3 is 88,572? Let me confirm using another method. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572. Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in any step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct.

Hmm, that seems consistent. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.

Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo reading the digits from bottom to top: 8 8 5 7 2.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial multiplication. Let me try again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing the digits in order: 8 (from the ten-thousands place), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So that's 87572. But when I did the alternative method, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check which one is correct.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nAh, so the correct result is 88572, not 87572.

Let me verify each layer step by step because maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.

But when I broke it down into parts, I got 88572. There's a conflict here. Let me check with a calculator to be sure.\n\nWait, I can't use a calculator, but let's do it manually again.\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, the correct result is 88572. Therefore, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was incorrect because I misaligned the digits. The correct way is 88572.\n\nSo, to summarize, starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which gives us 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. Each step builds on the previous one, and by carefully computing each layer, I avoid mistakes. It's easy to make an arithmetic error, especially with larger numbers, so double-checking each step is crucial.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost expression, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 0*3=0. So yes, 88572. Wait, but let me double-check with another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 +1=7, write 7. 0 + 5 = 5, write 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. 5 + 2 = 7 +1=8, write 8. 2 + 0 = 2, write 2. So, 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I computed each layer correctly. Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. I think I did it correctly. Another way to check is to notice that each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). If I think about it, each layer is similar to a geometric series or something. But since the number of layers is finite (nine layers), computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Suppose I have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))). If it's infinite, it converges to a/(1 - b), but in this case, it's finite, so it's a bit different. But since we have nine layers, maybe there's a pattern or formula for the nth layer. Let me see. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5)/2 -1/2=243/2 -1/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. I think that's solid. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a recurrence relation formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the nested structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{previous term})\\), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

I must have made a mistake in the earlier step-by-step multiplication. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back a bit. When I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88,572. But let me make sure that each layer was computed correctly because if any of those layers were wrong, the final answer would be off.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step to verify:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 7 earlier, I wrote 3,280, but when I was doing the step-by-step multiplication, I think I might have miscalculated somewhere, but the breakdown into components seems correct.\n\nSo, to recap, each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost, which is 4. Then each subsequent layer is built on that, and finally, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, after computing all layers up to Layer 9, which is 29,524, and then multiplying by 3, I get 88,572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, it's more of a recursively defined expression. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has nine layers, it's easier to compute each step manually as I did before.\n\nBut just for fun, let me see if I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when doing multiple layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are accurate. Each step follows logically, and I didn't skip any layers. It's a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer helps prevent mistakes. I can also see a pattern here where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is a geometric progression of sorts. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. If it were more layers, I might look for a formula or a recursive relation to compute it more efficiently. But for now, step by step works fine.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is like a function f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), starting from f(1) = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is just applying this function again. So, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This recursive formula might help in understanding the growth pattern, but since we only have nine layers, it's not necessary to find a closed-form solution. However, it's interesting to note that each layer grows exponentially because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is a linear recurrence relation. The closed-form solution for such a recurrence would be something like f(n) = (3^n - 1)/2, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Let me test it with n=1: f(1)=4. Using the formula: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, let's think about it again. The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. Let's try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be f_h(n) = A*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant, say f_p(n)=C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. So the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition f(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test it for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4, which matches. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40, which matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, it would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, this method also confirms the result. It's reassuring to see that both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same answer. This makes me confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the expression into its constituent layers and computing each one step by step, and then verifying with a formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrived at the final answer of 88572. It was a bit time-consuming, but taking it one layer at a time helped prevent mistakes. I also learned that recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence can be a powerful tool for solving such problems more efficiently, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus three times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer and proceed outward until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4  \n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13  \n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40  \n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121  \n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364  \n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093  \n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280  \n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841  \n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:  \n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me some time. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it that way to confirm. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 to a_9. Wait, actually, in our problem, the innermost layer was a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. Then, each subsequent layer is a_{n} where n increases by 1. So, the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which is reassuring. This confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a linear recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost term and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost term by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Use each result to compute the next layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost term by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe I made a mistake in the breakdown. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

But wait, let me check if my Layers were computed correctly because 88572 seems quite a large number, and maybe I messed up the layers somewhere. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check once more. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, and then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a geometric series perhaps? Let me see. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, I notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 => C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me just double-check my multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.

Let's see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Alternatively, the nth term can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I also arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series where each layer adds another power of 3. Let me see: If I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))). Each time, you're adding another 3 inside. So, when you expand all the parentheses, you get 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))). If I let the innermost term be 1 +3, then each layer adds another 3*previous term +1. But I think the approach I took earlier is solid, so I'll stick with it.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute it again just to be absolutely sure. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication earlier.\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n3*3=9 +2=11, write down 1, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdd them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step and using a closed-form formula to verify, we find that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer computation step by step.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. So each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9, which we found to be 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since in this problem there are only 9 layers, computing each step manually was manageable, though time-consuming. However, recognizing the pattern and applying the formula is a better approach for scalability.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^10=(3^5)^2=243^2=59049. So, that's correct.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n\n9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8, carry 0\n\nSo, the product is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, and using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the innermost value and work our way outward. After computing all layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation confirms the solution.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to write it out step by step, but that might get messy. Alternatively, since I have a formula for a_n, I can use that. Since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, solve the recurrence relation, or use the formula, I end up with the same result: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the expression is a nested recurrence relation where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$.

Maybe a geometric series or something.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nComparing both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B.\n\nSo, B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4.\n\nSo, 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nNow, our problem has 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it without manually going through each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer manually and get the same result as the formula, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've considered both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach, and both lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm pretty sure that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Solving this recurrence relation, we find a closed-form solution \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, this gives \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3, we get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next nested term)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:** Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Compute Each Subsequent Layer:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\).\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\).\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\).\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\).\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\).\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\).\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe result of the computation is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Alternatively, 30000*3=90000, so 29524 is 476 less than 30000, so 29524*3=90000 - (476*3)=90000 -1428=88572. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.

Wait, no, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, let me write it as 29,524.

Let me go through each layer again just to make sure I didn't make an error in one of the steps. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as L_n where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our previous calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, so it's a geometric series with a multiplier. But since I already got the same result through both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify my calculations because sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might make a mistake. Let me check each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here. Let me think about this.\n\nThe expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n... and so on up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis kind of recurrence can be solved to find a closed-form expression, which might make it easier to compute without calculating each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n = 1, a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, the formula works for the first few terms. Therefore, we can use this formula to compute a_9.\n\nCompute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\n3^10 is 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} =177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nSame result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the outermost result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3 times that is 88572. Hmm, but I have a feeling that the answer might be different because sometimes when you have multiple layers, especially with multiplication, it's easy to miscount the layers or the operations. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, let's compute that: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, a_9 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me verify the calculation of 3*29524 once again. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. Next digit: 9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, writing it all together: 8 (from the last digit), 9, 7, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, let me write it properly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15 \u2192 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27 \u21927, carry 2. 9*3=27 +2=29 \u21929, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading from top to bottom: 8 9 7 7 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me write it as:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x         3\n   ------------\n     8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 4*3=12, so write 2, carry 1. Then 2*3=6 +1=7. Then 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Then 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Then 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. By solving each layer step by step and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using the formula for the nth term of a geometric series, we determine the outermost layer's value before multiplying by 3 to get the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3 * 3 = 9 + 2 = 11, write down 11. So, putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572. Let's compute that: 87000 + 1000 = 88000, then +572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because each layer depends on the previous one, so a small error in one layer could propagate. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841 * 3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the original problem again. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine layers, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses: Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and another parenthesis. Let me count the number of times \"1+\" occurs. Starting from the first 1+ inside the first parenthesis, each layer adds another. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). How many layers are there? Let me see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many sets of (1+3(...)) are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see: After the first 3(, there are 8 more opening parentheses before the innermost 1+3. Wait, let me count: The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, then inside that, another 1+3(, and so on. So, the number of layers is 9, because each time we have a new (1+3(...)). So, layer 1: innermost (1+3), layer 2: next one out, up to layer 9: the outermost. So, my earlier computation was correct with 9 layers, ending at Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But wait, let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3(, each ( is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, actually, each ( after the first 3( is a new layer, so the total number of layers is 9. So, my initial approach was correct, computing up to Layer 9. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again, maybe using a different approach to cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works perfectly. So, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} manually. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Correct. So, 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated 9 times, resulting in the outermost layer being 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the next nested term. There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 87572? Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 29524 * 3 more carefully. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 87572. Wait, that seems correct? Hmm, but let me verify using another method. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that's different from the 87572 I got earlier. So I must have made a mistake in my initial multiplication. Let me check where I went wrong. When I did the digit-by-digit multiplication:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n2 (from 4\u00d73=12, carryover 1)\n7 (from 2\u00d73 +1=7)\n5 (from 5\u00d73=15, carryover 1)\n7 (from 2\u00d73 +1=7)\n7 (from 9\u00d73=27, carryover 2)\n8 (from 2\u00d73 +2=8)\n\nSo writing it as 87572, but when I broke it down, I got 88572. Clearly, there's a discrepancy. Let me check each step again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing. Let me write it properly with each digit's place:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- Units place: 4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n- Ten-thousands place: 9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 87572. But when I did the expanded form, I got 88572. Hmm, that's inconsistent. Let me check the expanded form again.\n\nWait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So 20000\u00d73=60000, 9000\u00d73=27000, 500\u00d73=1500, 20\u00d73=60, 4\u00d73=12. Now, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo that's 88572. But when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572. So where is the mistake? Let me check the digit positions again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write 29524 as:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo when I multiply each by 3:\n\n- Units: 4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, no carryover.\n- Hundreds: 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands: 9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo writing it out, starting from units: 2, then 7, 5, 8, 8. So the number is 88,572. Wait, that's 88572, which matches the expanded form. So I must have made a mistake in my initial digit-by-digit multiplication by perhaps misplacing a digit. So the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-by-digit earlier, I thought it was 87572, but now I see it's 88572. So I must have misplaced the digits when I first wrote it down. So the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me confirm once more. If Layer 9 is 29,524, then 29,524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, to recap, I started by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1,093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 3,280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 9,841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly counted the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. So I think I correctly computed up to Layer 9, which is 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d7Layer7. Layer7 is 3,280. So 3\u00d73,280 = 9,840, plus 1 is 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen 3\u00d729,524: Let me compute 29,524 \u00d7 3 again to be sure.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d73 =12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927.\n5 \u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo writing it from top to bottom: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, when I broke down 29,524 into 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4, I saw that 3\u00d729,524 is 88,572. So that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out, I arrive at the final answer of 88,572.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any errors in my calculations now, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost Layer):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation here. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, we have C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides, we get D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost layer is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a recursive structure. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. This kind of recursive sequence might have a closed-form solution. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let me compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work. However, recognizing the pattern and solving the recurrence relation is a powerful technique that can save a lot of time, especially for more complex or larger problems. So, in summary, by breaking down the problem step by step, computing each layer from the inside out, and then verifying with a formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrived at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by recognizing a repeating pattern and using a recurrence relation. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 3 * 3 = 9 + 2 = 11, write down 11. Wait, that's not the right way either. Maybe I should do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake.\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nBut let me check using another method to be sure. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake earlier when computing each layer. Let me go back step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems to be computed correctly. Then, multiplying by 3 at the end gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 1+3(...), that's a new layer. Let me count:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer because the problem has nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the arithmetic again because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have n=9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I got earlier by computing each layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute a_9 using the formula again:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: Compute the innermost parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2**: Use the result from Layer 1.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3**: Use the result from Layer 2.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4**: Use the result from Layer 3.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5**: Use the result from Layer 4.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6**: Use the result from Layer 5.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7**: Use the result from Layer 6.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8**: Use the result from Layer 7.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9**: Use the result from Layer 8.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n    - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\nSo, writing it from top to bottom: 8 (from 2\u00d73+2), then 7 (from 9\u00d73), 7 (from 5\u00d73), 5 (from 2\u00d73), 7 (from 2\u00d73), and 2 (from 4\u00d73). Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, no, the digits are:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- Units place: 2\n- Tens place: 7\n- Hundreds place: 5\n- Thousands place: 7\n- Ten-thousands place: 8\n\nSo, the number is 88572. Wait, but 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, I thought that was the innermost part, but actually, let me check how many layers I computed. I started with Layer 1 as 1+3=4, then Layer 2=13, Layer3=40, Layer4=121, Layer5=364, Layer6=1093, Layer7=3280, Layer8=9841, Layer9=29524. So, that's nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer9, so 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me recast the problem as a recursive function. Let\u2019s define a function f(n) where f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, f(1)=4, f(2)=1 + 3*4=13, f(3)=1 + 3*13=40, f(4)=1 + 3*40=121, f(5)=1 + 3*121=364, f(6)=1 + 3*364=1093, f(7)=1 + 3*1093=3280, f(8)=1 + 3*3280=9841, f(9)=1 + 3*9841=29524. So, that seems correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. Wait, but let me compute f(9) again to make sure.\n\nf(1)=4\nf(2)=1 + 3*4=13\nf(3)=1 + 3*13=1 + 39=40\nf(4)=1 + 3*40=1 + 120=121\nf(5)=1 + 3*121=1 + 363=364\nf(6)=1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093\nf(7)=1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280\nf(8)=1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841\nf(9)=1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (from 2\u00d73+2), then 7 (from 9\u00d73), 7 (from 5\u00d73), 5 (from 2\u00d73), 7 (from 2\u00d73), and 2 (from 4\u00d73). Wait, that seems off because when you write it down, the digits should be in the correct places. Let me write it vertically:\n\n     29524\n   \u00d7    3\n   --------\n     88572\n\nYes, that looks right. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I compute 29524 \u00d7 3, I get 88572, but let me check with another method. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again, step by step, to make sure I didn't make any errors in the earlier steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, the first multiplication by 3 is at the very end, after all the layers. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It's a geometric series or something similar. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps it's a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nIn this case, k = 3, c = 1. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.

Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Wait, that's different from my previous result. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the multiplication earlier. Let me try again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 9*3=27+2=29, write 9, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So that's 89532. But when I did it the other way, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. I must have messed up the breakdown. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 9*3=27, write down 7, carry 2. Next digit: 9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So putting it together: 89532.

So now I'm confused because two different methods give me two different results. That means I made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me check which one is correct. Let's compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. So that's 88572. Therefore, my initial step-by-step multiplication was wrong. The correct result is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check this because I might have messed up the addition as well. Let me add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 4+4=8, 2+2=4, 5+5=10, carry over 1. 9+9=18 +1=19, carry over 1. 2+2=4 +1=5. So that's 59048. Then adding 59048 + 29524: 8+4=12, write 2, carry 1. 4+2=6 +1=7. 0+5=5. 9+9=18, write 8, carry 1. 5+2=7 +1=8. 9+ nothing=9. So that's 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let's go back to the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Let me recompute each layer step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I might have just made a mistake in my initial multiplication, but after verifying with addition, it checks out.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 3 * 2 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I think I might have made a mistake in the breakdown. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations for each layer because if I made a mistake in one of the layers, the final answer would be off. Let me go through each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems to check out. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Alternatively, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let me try to model this. Let's define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But in our case, a_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. Let me check what a_0 would be. If n=1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, but a_1 is given as 4, so 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. So, the general solution is a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^n * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Simplifying, a_n = 3^n + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, a_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result using a different method, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiply by 3. But in any case, the final result is 88572. I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer after verifying it through both iterative computation and using the recurrence relation formula.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost expression and then compute the final result by multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, starting from the innermost layer.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - Layer 3: a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - Layer 4: a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - Layer 5: a\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - Layer 6: a\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: a\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: a\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Recurrence Formula**: Recognizing the pattern, the nth term a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Compute the Final Expression**: Multiply the result by 3, as the entire expression is 3*a\u2089.\n   - Final Result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier computations because the numbers are getting quite large, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Specifically, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution as a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirmed my earlier step-by-step computation. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a geometric progression. Since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), and if I keep expanding it, it's similar to a geometric series.\n\nLet me try expanding the innermost part:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, that's 1 + 3*(previous total). So, each time, it's adding 3 times the previous sum plus 1. But perhaps, if I think of it as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, if I denote S_n as the sum up to n terms, then each layer is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}.\n\nBut that's the same recurrence as before. So, regardless, the closed-form solution gives me a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let's see:\n\nIf I expand the entire expression, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds 1 + 3*(previous). So, when fully expanded, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nWait, that seems to be the pattern. So, each layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, but starting from 1 instead of 3^0=1. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's check:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, in general, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, which is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches our earlier closed-form solution.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times this sum, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expression without layers, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Each time, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*something.\n\nBut regardless of the approach, whether step-by-step computation, using recurrence relations, or recognizing it as a geometric series, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication step again because sometimes when numbers get large, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's compute 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each step and verifying, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find the solution step by step.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Recognize the Geometric Series**: Each layer \\(a_n\\) can be expressed as \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).

Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3 * 29524 = 87572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We know that a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, for n=0, if we consider a_0, it would be 1 + 3*a_{-1}, but that might not make sense here. Alternatively, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4. Then each subsequent layer wraps around, so Layer 9 would be a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=87572. So, the final answer is 87572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Wait, that's different from 87572. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Wait, wait, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. But earlier, I computed 3*29524=87572. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation. Let me check where I went wrong. Wait, in the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is (3^{10}-1)/2. So, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. So, 3^{11}=177147, so 177147-3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. But earlier, when I computed 3*29524, I got 87572. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 =12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 =6 +1=7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15, write down5, carry over1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28, write down8, carry over2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 87572.\n\nBut according to the formula, it should be 88572. So, I must have made a mistake in computing a_9. Wait, let me check a_9 again. a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049-1=59048. 59048/2=29524. So, that's correct. Then, 3*29524=87572. But according to the formula, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, there's a conflict here. That suggests that either my formula is wrong or my manual computation is wrong. Let me check the formula again. The formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=87572. But according to the alternative formula, (3^{11}-3)/2=88572. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Correct. So, (3^{11}-3)/2=177144/2=88572. But when I compute 3*29524, I get 87572. So, where is the mistake? Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the outermost: 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nInside that, it's 3(...), which is another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me write it out with indentation:\n\n3(\n  1 + 3(\n    1 + 3(\n      1 + 3(\n        1 + 3(\n          1 + 3(\n            1 + 3(\n              1 + 3(\n                1 + 3(\n                  1 + 3\n                )\n              )\n            )\n          )\n        )\n      )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nSo, counting the layers, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1, then each \"1 + 3(...)\" adds a layer. So, how many layers? Let's see: from the innermost, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", and then the outermost 3*(...). Wait, no, the outermost is 3*(...), which contains 9 layers inside. So, the innermost is layer 1:1+3, then layer 2:1+3*(layer1), up to layer9:1+3*(layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, in terms of the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*a_9=87572. But according to the alternative formula, (3^{11}-3)/2=88572. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 3*29524 again carefully. 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15, write down5, carry over1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28, write down8, carry over2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 87572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=87572. Then, why does the formula give 88572? Let me check the formula again. The formula was derived for a_n=1+3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=87572. The alternative approach where I considered the entire expression as (3^{11}-3)/2 might be incorrect because that formula assumes that the entire expression is a single layer, but in reality, the expression is 3*(a_9), not a_{10}. So, the correct approach is to compute a_9 and then multiply by 3, giving 87572. Therefore, the final answer should be 87572. Wait, but let me confirm with another method. Let me compute the expression step by step manually, just to be sure. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 =4.\n\nNext layer:1 +3*4=13.\n\nNext:1 +3*13=40.\n\nNext:1 +3*40=121.\n\nNext:1 +3*121=364.\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3:29524*3=87572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think the formula approach might have been misapplied earlier. The formula gives a_n for each layer, but the entire expression is 3*a_9, not a_{10}. So, the correct answer is 87572. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression as a single recurrence, starting from the innermost, but I think the way I did it manually is correct. Therefore, I conclude that the final answer is 87572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost layers step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Start with the innermost parentheses:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:**\n   - Final result: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 87572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value of the expression is \\boxed{87572}."

Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry over 0.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry over 2.\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9 + 2 = 11 \u2192 write 11.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3 \u00d7 29524 should be 88572. Let me verify with another method. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n29,524 \u00d7 3 = (30,000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Let's see: Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, up to the outermost, which is the first layer. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is the last one, which is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, in my earlier calculation, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But let me make sure I didn't skip any layers. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the value grows exponentially, which is why the final number is so large. Let me just check each layer's calculation to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, I think I've double-checked each step, and all the calculations seem correct.

So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might not be the case because sometimes when you have multiple layers, there might be a pattern or formula that can be applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression.\n\nThis looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\nUp to a_9, since there are 9 layers.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponentiation. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243*243:\n\n243 * 200 = 48,600\n\n243 * 40 = 9,720\n\n243 * 3 = 729\n\nAdding them up: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^10 is 59,049, so (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, all steps check out.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that the entire expression is a geometric series with ratio 3 and 9 terms, but since it's nested, the formula I used earlier is more appropriate.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern that fits a linear recurrence relation, we can efficiently compute the result. The expression simplifies using the formula for a geometric series, leading to the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Define Recurrence Relation**: Let a_n represent the value at each layer, starting from the innermost. The relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The general solution for the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is found to be a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Innermost Layer**: For n=9, compute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."
