Let me check: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So, reading from top, it's 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, finally, the entire expression is 3*29524.

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 2 * 3 = 6. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524. 79048 + 9524: 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572. So yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))), with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is built by the previous one. Let's let a_n be the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the problem reduces to finding a_9 where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I still get the same result, which reinforces that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. If I expand it, it might form a geometric series. Let me try to write out the expansion. Starting from the innermost: a_1 = 1 + 3. a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Wait a minute, this looks like powers of 3. Indeed, each a_n seems to be the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}. Because a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1. a_2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2. a_3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. The sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r = 3, so sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Which is exactly what we found earlier. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and 3*a_9 = 88572. Therefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, or recognizing the geometric series\u2014I arrive at the same result. This consistency across different methods makes me confident that the answer is correct. So, after carefully working through the problem, breaking it down, and verifying each step, I conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

Let me recount:\n\nWait, 29524 is 5 digits, so when multiplied by 3, it's possible to get a 6-digit number. Let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9 + 1 = 10 \u2192 write 0, carry 1\nBut wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4.

Then, after that, there's no more digits, but we had a carryover of 2 before? Wait, no, after 9\u00d73=27, we write 7 and carry 2. Then, the next digit is 2 (from 29524), which is the ten-thousands place. So 2\u00d73=6 + carryover 2 = 8, write 8. Then, since there are no more digits, we're done.

Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. I think that's right. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step builds on the previous one, and I verified each layer's computation. Multiplying by 3 at the end also checked out when I broke it down digit by digit and using the expanded form.

Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, I'm a bit confused because when I compute each layer, it seems like each layer is growing exponentially, which makes sense because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the growth is rapid. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. I recall that expressions of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or perhaps using recursion. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.

Wait, let me check that again because I might have miscalculated. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each step because sometimes when you do a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, this seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is what I did earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^(h) = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^(p) = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, either way, whether computing step by step, using the recurrence, or using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.

Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = (29000 + 524) \u00d7 3 = 29000\u00d73 + 524\u00d73 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572. Let's add those: 87000 + 1000 = 88000, 88000 + 572 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a geometric series or some recursive pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such expressions. The general form seems to be a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can write it as a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me find c such that this holds. Expanding the right side: 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. So, we have a_n + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Rearranging, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 2c. But from the original recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, 3*a_{n-1} + 2c = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which implies 2c = 1, so c = 1/2. Therefore, a_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2). This means that the sequence b_n = a_n + 1/2 is a geometric sequence with ratio 3. So, b_n = b_1 * 3^{n-1}. Given that a_1 = 4, then b_1 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, b_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9/2)*3^{n-1} = (3^{2}/2)*3^{n-1} = (3^{n+1})/2. Therefore, a_n = b_n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the outermost layer being 29,524.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, expanding the entire expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be represented as a sum of 3^n terms. But since each layer is built upon the previous, it's more efficient to use the recurrence relation approach, which we've already done. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the initial layers, so I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break down the expression starting from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next term})$.

Wait, let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 5*3=15+2=17, write 7, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8.

Hmm, but wait a minute, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. So that's correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I did the multiplication, I had to carry over multiple times, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Let me try a different approach: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can use another method, like recognizing a pattern. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 12 = 13. L(3) = 1 + 3*L(2) = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_p(n) = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*L(9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Wait, let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to look at it, confirming the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9 * 3 = 27, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So yes, that gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check if I correctly computed each layer. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again to ensure there were no errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, except for the innermost layer, which is just 1 + 3. So, perhaps another way to approach this is by recognizing a pattern or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2, it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach, I arrived at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 0 * 3 = 0. 0 * 3 = 0. 0 * 3 = 0. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 0*3=0, write 0. 0*3=0, write 0. 0*3=0, write 0. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yeah, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't skip any steps or miscalculate. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3 + B. Also, for the recurrence, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging in, let's assume a particular solution is B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Then, using the initial condition: 4 = A*3 + (-1/2) => A*3 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the outermost layer before the final multiplication is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. However, for practice, let's see if we can find a formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for such equations.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUse the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost, we arrived at the final result. Additionally, recognizing the recurrence relation allowed us to find a general formula, which confirmed our step-by-step computation. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer until we reach the outermost one. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nMultiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me check that again because when I did it step by step, I thought it was 88572, but let me confirm. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry 1, write 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, carry 1, write 5. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, carry 2, write 8. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to check. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1=4. This is a recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + L_0, but in this case, L_1=4, and each subsequent layer adds another multiplication by 3. Wait, actually, the standard solution for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1). Let me check that. Let's see, for n=1, L_1 = a + b*L_0, but in our case, L_1=4, which is 1 + 3*1=4. Wait, but in the problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, so maybe L_1=4, and each subsequent layer is L_{k} =1 + 3*L_{k-1}. So, for k=2, L_2=1 +3*4=13, which matches. So, the recurrence is L_k =1 +3*L_{k-1}, with L_1=4. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^{k} + C, where C is a constant. To find C, let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_k^h = A*3^k. The particular solution can be found by assuming L_k^p = B, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: B =1 +3*B => B -3B=1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k -1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_k= (3/2)*3^k -1/2= (3^{k+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with k=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For k=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer k, L_k=(3^{k+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so k=9. Therefore, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. That's a good check. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same final answer. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Each layer computation: 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524. Multiplying the last one by 3 gives 88572. Yes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation and the derived formula, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 3 * 3 = 9, write down 9. Wait, that seems off. Let me try again, maybe I missed a digit. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that matches. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, each layer is defined recursively by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, so the homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step correctly, and both methods give the same answer, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result. I think that's it. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and both the recursive step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula approach led me to the same answer. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the value of the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute each nested layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is 29,524, so let me write it as 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. 29,524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88,572. Hmm, but 29,524 * 3: Let me compute it another way. 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, I think I made a mistake in the earlier layers because I was counting the layers incorrectly. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then, each 1+3(...) adds another layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers correctly. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of layers by the number of times 1+3 appears. From the innermost, we have 1+3, then each time we add another 1+3(...). Let me list them:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, so I had 9 layers, and then the final multiplication by 3. So, in my initial calculation, I went up to Layer 9 as 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But let me verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again because I think I might have made a mistake there. Layer 6 is 1,093, so Layer 7 is 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. That's correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3,280 = 9,840. 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9,841 = Let's compute 9,841 * 3. 9,000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, the final step is 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems to be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging in the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, for n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: a_2 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nThen, from equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2,187 - 1)/2 = 2,186/2 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6,561 - 1)/2 = 6,560/2 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19,683 - 1)/2 = 19,682/2 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the innermost layer a_1 is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the formula. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is a_9, is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be expressed as 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177,147\n\nSo, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. That's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a geometric series. The final result is computed as follows:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place):\n9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (ten thousands place):\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, but that doesn't match with my earlier thought. Let me check:\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was computing the layers, I thought Layer 9 was 29524, so multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my computations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long process.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nThis expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. It resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to find a general formula for such expressions.\n\nSuppose we define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + d/(c-1)) * c^{n-1} - d/(c-1).\n\nIn our case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the solution would be:\n\na_n = (a_1 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1)\n= (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2\n= (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nSimplifying:\n\n(9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9/2)*(3^{n-1}) = (3^2)/2 * 3^{n-1} = (3^{n+1})/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nStarting with a_1 = 4. Using the formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works for each layer.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1 (n=1), and the outermost is layer 9 (n=9). So, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers.\n\nIf I let x = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), but since there are nine layers, it's finite. So, perhaps it's better to model it as a finite geometric series.\n\nWait, but in the case of a finite geometric series, the sum S = a1*(r^n -1)/(r -1). But in this case, each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, which complicates things a bit.\n\nWait, but earlier, I saw that each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. So, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is building up a number in base 3. Because each time you have 1 + 3*something, which is like adding a digit in base 3. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here, but it's an interesting observation.\n\nWait, let me try to write out the numbers I got for each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 1 + 3\nLayer 2:13=1 + 3*4\nLayer 3:40=1 + 3*13\nLayer 4:121=1 + 3*40\nLayer 5:364=1 + 3*121\nLayer 6:1093=1 + 3*364\nLayer 7:3280=1 + 3*1093\nLayer 8:9841=1 + 3*3280\nLayer 9:29524=1 + 3*9841\n\nI can see that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is like a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that helps in computing it faster. Maybe not necessary here since we've already got the answer.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is 3*(layer 9), and layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 29524*3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2 with carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15 \u21925 with carryover1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928 with carryover2\n2*3=6 +2=8\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 30000*3=90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 3*29524=3*(30000 - 476)=90000 - 1428=88572. That's another way to compute it.\n\nYes, that works too. 3*29524=3*(30000 - 476)=90000 - 1428=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms it again.\n\nI think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check that multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each step because it's easy to make an arithmetic error here. Starting again from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Let me compute that again more carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Wait, wait, I think I messed up the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n      29524\n    x     3\n    --------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carried) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when I multiply:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo putting it together: 8 (from ten thousands), 8 (from thousands), 5 (from hundreds), 7 (from tens), 2 (from units). Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, no, the digits are:\n\nStarting from the right, the digits are:\n\n- Units: 2\n- Tens: 7\n- Hundreds: 5\n- Thousands: 8\n- Ten thousands: 8\n\nWait, that would be 88572? But 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly computed each layer. Because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate a layer and then the error propagates. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So the final multiplication is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I look at the original expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So the outermost operation is 3*(something). Therefore, after computing the innermost layers up to Layer 9, which is 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final result. So yes, 88572 is the answer.\n\nBut let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula for such nested expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a relation can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. So the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then we multiply by 3 to get the final result: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other. Each \"1+3(\" starts a new layer, and each \")\" closes it. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of layers:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nEach time we see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The first 3(1+3(...)) is the outermost layer, which is layer 9.\n2. Then inside that, another 1+3(1+3(...)) is layer 8.\n3. Continuing this way, we have 9 layers in total because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and we have 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nSo, yes, n=9, which gives us a_9=29524, then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it using two methods: step-by-step computation and finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations. Both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost layers, we find the value of the outermost layer, which is 29524. We then multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check my earlier steps again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or compute incorrectly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Hmm, that seems right, but let me check one more time. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about this. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we're dealing with Layer 9, which is a_9, let's compute that. a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So putting it all together: 87572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So yes, the result is 87572. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me verify using another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Wait, that's different. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my multiplication earlier. Let me do it again carefully. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carryover.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carryover.\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nSo, the result is 87572. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. That means I must have made a mistake in the addition method. Let me check that again. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524. Let's add them:\n\n29524\n+29524\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 + 4 = 8\n2 + 2 = 4\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carryover 1\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carryover 1\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Now, adding another 29524:\n\n59048\n+29524\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n0 + 5 = 5\n9 + 2 = 11, write down 1, carryover 1\n5 + 9 = 14 + 1 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, so now I'm confused because the multiplication gave me 87572 and the addition gave me 88572. There must be a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check the multiplication again. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\nSo, the digits are 8,7,5,7,2. Wait, that would be 87572. But the addition gave me 88572. So where is the error? Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Oh! So the correct result is 88572, which matches the addition method. So, where did I go wrong in the digit-by-digit multiplication? I think I must have miscounted the digits or misplaced a number. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7 \u2192 write down 7\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7 \u2192 write down 7\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 2\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8 \u2192 write down 8\nSo, writing the digits from top to bottom: 8,7,5,7,2. Wait, that would be 87572, but that's incorrect because the correct answer is 88572. I think I missed a digit. Wait, no, 29524 has five digits: 2,9,5,2,4. So when I multiply each digit by 3, starting from the right:\n\nDigit 1: 4 \u2192 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\nDigit 2: 2 \u2192 6 + 1 =7\nDigit 3:5 \u219215 \u21925, carryover 1\nDigit 4:2 \u21926 +1=7\nDigit 5:9 \u219227 \u21927, carryover 2\nDigit 6:2 \u21926 +2=8\n\nWait, but 29524 is a five-digit number, so when you multiply by 3, you should have five digits in the product, but I think I'm miscounting the digits. Let me write it out vertically:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   \u00d7       3\n   -----------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\nSo the product is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So earlier, when I thought I was getting 87572, I must have miscounted the digits or misplaced the carryover. So the correct final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check everything because this seems a bit time-consuming, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, going back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that all checks out. So the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer results in a specific number. Multiplying the outermost result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute 29,524 * 3 step by step. 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.

Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check all my layers because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the earlier steps, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^10=59,049. Therefore, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 =59,048/2=29,524. That's consistent with what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Start with the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result: 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n3. Repeat this process until reaching the outermost layer.\n4. Finally, multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3.\n\nUsing a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute incorrectly. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to save time instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function because the recurrence is linear and of the first order. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n-1}. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{0} - 1/2 => 4 = C - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2. Alternatively, since 9 = 3^2, we can write this as (3^{2} * 3^{n-1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, that seems promising. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result without computing each layer step by step. It's much faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But for this problem, since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable, though a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern and using the formula is more efficient. So, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the inside out, or by recognizing the pattern and using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result: 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just quickly verify the multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.

Let me write it out:\n\n   29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but when I add up the intermediate steps earlier, I thought 3*29524 would be 88572. Let me confirm with another method. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because each layer depends on the previous one, so if I messed up any step, all the subsequent layers would be wrong. Let me go through the layers again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each (1 + 3(...) is a layer. Let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers. I computed up to Layer 9, which is correct. So, yes, the final computation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve this, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this kind of nested expression, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. It seems like each layer is following the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} is 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. I think I've solved it correctly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the step-by-step approach. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since I've already computed each term manually, maybe it's not necessary here. However, it's good to recognize the pattern.

So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me substitute into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nNow, equate the left and right sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4.\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm 3^{10} is indeed 59049. Let me compute 3^7=2187, 3^8=2187*3=6561, 3^9=6561*3=19683, 3^{10}=19683*3=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=59049*3=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different methods all led to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me check that again because 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it that way. Let's define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, using the recurrence relation, I can compute each term as I did before, and it matches. Alternatively, the closed-form solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. But a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I have the wrong starting point. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different because each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me solve the recurrence relation properly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value. The innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer. Using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula derived from a recurrence relation, we confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series. Let me denote the innermost expression as a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This seems to follow the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is defined based on the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to the innermost term, a1 = 4. So, a1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost term is a9. So, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series with each term multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I let x be the innermost expression, then each layer is 1 + 3x, and so on. But since we have multiple layers, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. The total number of terms is 9, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, the sum can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. However, in this case, the structure is a bit different because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, perhaps it's better to model it as a recurrence relation as I did earlier. Either way, the result seems consistent. Let me just recap to make sure I haven't missed anything. The problem is to compute a deeply nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer, starting from the innermost 1 + 3. There are nine such layers, and the entire expression is multiplied by 3. By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I arrived at the outermost layer being 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Additionally, by modeling the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution, I confirmed that the outermost term is indeed 29524, leading to the same final result. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with nine layers. Let me think about whether this sequence follows a known pattern. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 ... L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents, let me confirm 3^10 and 3^11. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that's correct. I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. By computing each layer step by step or applying a closed-form formula, we find that the result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1) and moving outward:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Outer Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n4. **Alternative Verification Using Recurrence Formula:**\n   The layers follow the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4. Solving this gives L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. There's no more digits, so we're done. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check using another method to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that checks out.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again because that seems like a lot of layers and the numbers are growing quite rapidly. Maybe I miscounted the layers or miscalculated somewhere.\n\nStarting over, let's list each layer step by step, ensuring each computation is correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check each multiplication step again to make sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are growing so quickly. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, with these nested expressions, there's a geometric series or a recursive formula that can simplify the computation.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, we have:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, where a=1 and b=3 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by:\n\nL_n = (a)/(1 - b) + b^n * C, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but in this case, since b \u2260 1, the solution is:\n\nL_n = (a)/(1 - b) + C*b^n\n\nBut let me double-check that. Actually, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*b^n, and the particular solution is a constant, since a is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nAssume L_n^p = K, a constant.\n\nThen, K = a + b*K\n\nSolving for K: K - b*K = a => K*(1 - b) = a => K = a/(1 - b)\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = a/(1 - b) + C*b^n\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1: L_1 = 4\n\nSo, 4 = a/(1 - b) + C*b^1\n\nWe have a=1, b=3, so:\n\n4 = 1/(1 - 3) + C*3\n\nSimplify 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2\n\nSo, 4 = -1/2 + 3C\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (-1/2) + (3/2)*3^n\n\nSimplify 3^n as 3^n, so:\n\nL_n = (-1/2) + (3/2)*3^n = (-1/2) + (3^{n+1})/2\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nL_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 =3*29524=88572\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 3^10 again to be thorough.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then \\(3 \\times 29524\\). Calculating this:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let's compute it digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go back and check each layer again because 88572 seems quite large, and maybe I messed up somewhere. Let me recalculate each layer carefully. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so total is 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, so that's consistent. But I'm a bit unsure because the number seems quite large. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, starting from the first 3, then 1+3(...), and each subsequent 1+3(...) adds another layer. Let me count them: After the initial 3, there's 1+3(...), and inside that, another 1+3(...), and so on. Let me see: The expression is 3 followed by 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so that's 9 layers. So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each computed correctly. Therefore, 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a geometric series perhaps? Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify that. Let me see if that formula works for n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that's not matching. Maybe I made a mistake in the general solution. Let me derive it properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches Layer 3=40. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's a more efficient way to compute it without having to go through each layer manually. But since the problem was presented in a nested form, computing each layer step by step was a good way to verify the process and ensure that I didn't make any mistakes along the way. It's also a good exercise in understanding how nested expressions work and how recurrence relations can be applied to simplify such problems. I think I've got it now.

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, carryover 2, write 7. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but let me verify if I did all the layers correctly because 88572 seems a bit large, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but when I think about it, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So each layer is 1 more than three times the previous. So, starting from 4, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, yes, each step seems correct. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. I recall that expressions like this can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's see. The recursion is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without calculating each layer step by step. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. However, if there were more layers, the formula would be much more efficient. But in this case, both methods lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the final result is 88572. I think I've double-checked my work enough times, so I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the formula confirms the result. So, yeah, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the formula for the nth term of this recursive sequence, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all layers, the final result is multiplied by 3 to get the answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. **Compute each layer from the innermost outward**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Wait, no, actually, the digits are 2,9,5,2,9,5,2,4. Wait, maybe I miscounted the digits. Let me check the number 29524. It's a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nWait, no, 29524 is actually 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0\n\nSo writing it out:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry 0\n5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carry 1\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928, carry 0\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me check with another method. 30000 \u00d7 3 = 90000, so 29524 is 30000 - 476. So 29524 \u00d73 = 90000 - (476 \u00d73). 476 \u00d73 = 1428. So 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364. Let's compute 364 \u00d73: 300\u00d73=900, 60\u00d73=180, 4\u00d73=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093. Let's compute 1093 \u00d73: 1000\u00d73=3000, 90\u00d73=270, 3\u00d73=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280. Compute 3280 \u00d73: 3000\u00d73=9000, 200\u00d73=600, 80\u00d73=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841. Compute 9841 \u00d73: Let's do it step by step. 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524.

Perfect, that matches. So yes, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and I double-checked each step. So I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

But let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because one wrong layer could throw off the entire calculation.

Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, starting from 1, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's similar to a recursive sequence. Let me define it as such. Let a_n be the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a formula for a_n. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's list out the a_n values: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 13\na_3 = 40\na_4 = 121\na_5 = 364\na_6 = 1093\na_7 = 3280\na_8 = 9841\na_9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term minus something. Let me check:\n\na_2 = 13, which is 3*4 + 1 = 13. Correct.\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Alternatively, 3*13 +1 = 40. Correct.\nSimilarly, a_4 = 3*40 +1 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier terms:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in calculation. Let's recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this more carefully:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, reading from bottom to top, we get 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it using another method to verify. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(...)\" sections. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the 1+3, there's another ( starting. Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then, moving out, the next is 1+3(...)\n3. Each time, another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of layers:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Each time you have a \"1+3(\" except for the innermost. So, let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...), each time adding another layer. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was correct, resulting in 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula to see if it matches my previous calculations.\n\nUsing a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer computed using the formula matches the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the final result is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize it as a nested recurrence relation. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the closed-form solution for such a recurrence, we find each layer's value up to the ninth layer, resulting in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Let's list each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check Layer 8 and Layer 9.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. That's correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the number is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to compute each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step is manageable. But for practice, let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1=4. So, L_1=4, L_2=13, L_3=40, L_4=121, L_5=364, L_6=1093, L_7=3280, L_8=9841, L_9=29524. Then, the total is 3*L_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, this recurrence can be represented as a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nEach L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nThen, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition. Let's say n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula holds. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it without going through each layer, but since I had to compute each layer manually before, it's good to know both methods.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could save time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, with nine layers, step-by-step computation is feasible.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Let me just recap the steps:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n3. Use the recurrence relation to find a general formula, which confirms the value of Layer 9.\n4. Multiply Layer 9 by 3 to get the final result.\n5. Verify each step to ensure accuracy.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe label each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
