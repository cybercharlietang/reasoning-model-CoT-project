Let me check again. Maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7, write 7. 5 *3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 0*3=0, write 0. 0*3=0, write 0. 2*3=6, write 6. So yes, that gives 88572. Wait, no, wait. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 units digit is 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens digit is 7, carryover 0.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 =7 \u2192 thousands digit is7, carryover 0.\nNext digit:9 *3=27 \u2192 ten-thousands digit is7, carryover 2.\nNext digit: 2 *3=6 +2=8 \u2192 hundred-thousands digit is8, carryover 0.\nDigits beyond that are 0, so we can stop here.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then +29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the innermost layer is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So after computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen 3 *29524=88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Since each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=1+3=4.\n\nThen, each subsequent term is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r=3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A =1 +3*A \u2192 A -3A=1 \u2192 -2A=1 \u2192 A= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 =3C -1/2 \u2192 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 C=(9/2)/3=3/2.\n\nThus, the general term is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, this method confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. Both methods, step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation, lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find each subsequent value. After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal computation: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original problem is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that's the final answer. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error. Let me check each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B \u2192 B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 as 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute a_9 using the closed-form formula again:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, each time, you're effectively building up a number that's a sum of powers of 3.\n\nFor example, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13\n\nWait, that might not be the most straightforward way. Alternatively, each layer is a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, each time you have 1 + 3*(...), which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nThis would result in a sum where each term is 3^k, starting from k=0 up to k=9, but perhaps that's not exactly accurate.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so when you expand it all, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))).\n\nExpanding this, it would be 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^{n-1}*1.\n\nWait, so for n layers, it's the sum from k=0 to k=n-1 of 3^k.\n\nBut wait, that's a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to m is (3^{m+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier.\n\nSo, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, n=9, so a_9 = (3^9 - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but 3^9 is 19683, so (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841, which is Layer 8.\n\nWait, that doesn't match because earlier we had a_9 as 29524, which is (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\nAh, I see, so perhaps the indexing is off. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the closed-form solution, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers.\n\nSo, for Layer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, correct.\n\nLayer 3: n=3, a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after verifying through multiple methods: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and geometric series sum, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but when I added up earlier, I thought of 3*(Layer 9) as 3*29524, which is 88572. But wait, let me verify the layers again because maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9.\n\nWait, let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, but I feel like that's a big number. Let me check the multiplication again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that checks out.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the problem was 3 times the Layer 9, but when I look back, the original expression is 3 times (Layer 9), so 3*(29524) = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The problem is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's count the opening parentheses after the first 3: There's 1+3(...), and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nStarting from the innermost: Each time, it's 1+3(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside the main 3(...). Each time, it's 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. Then: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. Then: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. Then: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. Then: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. Then: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. Then: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n10. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside the main 3*(...), so total layers are 9, right? So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each computed as above, leading to 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nHmm, but let me check again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent this as a recursive formula. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on, up to f(9). Then the total expression is 3*f(9).\n\nSo, let's compute f(n) for n from 1 to 9.\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, f(9) is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit concerned because 88572 seems like a very large number for such an expression, but considering each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added 1, it does grow exponentially. Let me see if there's another way to represent this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or can be modeled using a recurrence relation.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nWe have f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1).\n\nAssume f(n) = A*3^n + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4.\n\nf(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this for n=1:\n\nf(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nf(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nf(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, yes, 3^{10} is indeed 59049. Then, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer, verifying the recurrence relation, and using a closed-form solution, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form solution, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " The next digit is 9 (from 29524) but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, the digits are: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me verify my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, my calculations seem correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is essentially a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. But I think the recurrence approach worked well. So, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). By working from the innermost layer outward, and recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, I was able to compute each layer step by step and find the final value. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation made it quicker once I derived it. Either way, the final result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13 Layer 3:1 +3*13=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, the number is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 *3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression has 9 layers, right? Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So, I think I accounted for all 9 layers correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another set. Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: There are 9 closing parentheses after the last 1+3. So, that's 9 layers. So, I think I did all 9 layers correctly. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. I notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. First, the homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, this confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3(...).

So, that should be the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or check if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think.\n\nEach layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: 3A*3^1 + B = 9A + B = 13.\n\nWait, no, actually, the general solution for a linear recurrence like L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 is different. Let me recall the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nThe standard approach is to solve the homogeneous part and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9: (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Good.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form, since the expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same answer.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same result without computing each layer step by step, which is good because it confirms the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check the expression again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nThat's 9 layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost 1+3, and Layer 9 is the outermost before multiplying by 3.\n\nTherefore, the computation is correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the closed-form formula to see if I get the same numbers.\n\nLayer 1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4.\n\nLayer 2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13.\n\nLayer 3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40.\n\nLayer 4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121.\n\nLayer 5: (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364.\n\nLayer 6: (3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093.\n\nLayer 7: (3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280.\n\nLayer 8: (3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841.\n\nLayer 9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nYes, all these match my earlier computations. So, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it using a different approach, like expanding the expression.\n\nLet me try to expand the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E. So,\n\nE = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me work from the inside out:\n\nStart with the innermost 1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 1+3*4=13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40=121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121=364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSame result. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. The expression inside each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is like 1 + 3*sum of previous terms.\n\nBut in this case, since it's a finite number of layers (9), the closed-form approach using the recurrence relation seems the most straightforward.\n\nIn summary, by either iteratively computing each layer or using the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final value is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers, with the outermost term multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute incorrectly.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on. So, the general formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer is L_9 =29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, either way, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Because sometimes when you have a nested expression like this, the number of layers can affect the exponent. Let me confirm the formula again. If L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for each layer, starting from n=1, the value is as computed. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet\u2019s substitute into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nThen, -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.

Let me add them step by step:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the computation earlier.

Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a geometric series. Let me think. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result again.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric sequence might have saved time, but since I was able to compute each layer step by step, that worked too.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication step. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again to make sure I didn't skip any. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is the innermost, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time there's a (1+3(...)). Let's count how many times this happens.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1+3 is layer 1.\n\nThen, 1+3(layer1) is layer2.\n\nThen, 1+3(layer2) is layer3.\n\nContinuing until layer9, which would be the outermost one before the final 3*.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so the layers inside are 9 layers. So, I think I counted correctly: 9 layers from layer1 to layer9, each computed as above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of layers is 9, but the exponents in the formula would be 10, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's 3^{10}.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_9 \\). Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[ a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2.

So, multiplying the outermost 3 by 29524 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the problem isn't too long, computing each layer manually seems manageable. I don't recall a specific formula for this kind of nested expression, but it might be similar to a geometric series or something else. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually was feasible. However, for a deeper nesting, a formula would be more efficient. Let me try to derive the formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. Yes, this formula works. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the answer. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me write it step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nDigit 1: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nDigit 2: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\nDigit 3: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nDigit 4: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\nDigit 5: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\nDigit 6: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carry 0.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, it's 8 7 7 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 877572? But 29524 \u00d7 3 can't be that big. Wait, 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3. Let me compute it another way. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000; 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000; 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500; 20 \u00d7 3 = 60; 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I computed Layer 9 correctly. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So, each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication gives 88572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be expressed using a geometric series or some other formula. Let me see if that's possible here.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nI can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 \u2192 -2*A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for all layers up to n=9. So, using this formula, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 =177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Which matches what I got earlier. So, using the formula, I also get 88572.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\n1.

The outermost expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nTo verify, we use the recurrence relation formula derived:\n\\[ L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\nFor \\( n = 9 \\):\n\\[ L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\nThus, the final result is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThe value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3=1 + 3*13=40, etc., as I computed before. This recurrence relation can be solved. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, using the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step layer computation and the formula using the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\( L_n \\) can be expressed as \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For 9 layers, \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Compute 9841*3: Let's do it step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, after carefully checking each step, I believe the final answer is 88572.

    "text": " Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8\n\nSo putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then +29524 again: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524:\n\n- 59048 + 20000 = 79048\n- 79048 + 9000 = 88048\n- 88048 + 524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could compute this without manually calculating each layer. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is:\n\nL_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me recall. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, using both methods\u2014iterative computation and finding a closed-form formula\u2014I arrive at the same answer. This gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and double-checked my work, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer and then applying the closed-form formula for the nth layer, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is 29,524, so let's write it as 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, the number would be 88,572. Let me check that: 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 *3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer would be 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the computation earlier. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series, but with a twist because each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. However, if there were many more layers, we might need a formula. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, computing each one step by step is feasible. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as a geometric series. Let me try to express the entire expression. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to write this as a sum. Each time, we have 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so it's 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to some terms. Wait, let me see. Let's denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with my earlier computation. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let's see, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I can also compute it step by step without using the formula to make sure. Let me try that again. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), resulting in a geometric progression. By calculating each layer step by step or using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can give me the result without computing each layer step by step. Let's think about the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its general solution can be found. The homogeneous solution is for the equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me even more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression.

So, let's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we have 8 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens digit is 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15.

Ten-thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo, writing it down from the highest place to the lowest: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is 29,524, so 29,524 * 3.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the place values. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29,524\ntimes 3\n________\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but 29,524 * 3: Let me verify with another method. 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here, but since the numbers are manageable, computing each layer step by step seems feasible.\n\nWait, another way to look at it is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. Then, a_9 would be the value we need, and then multiply by 3.\n\nAlternatively, this recursive formula can be expressed as a geometric series. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have n=9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the exponentiation. 3^10 is indeed 59,049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. 243*243: 200*200=40,000; 200*43=8,600; 43*200=8,600; 43*43=1,849. So, adding up: 40,000 + 8,600 + 8,600 + 1,849 = 59,049. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, everything checks out. The answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern which can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives us the value of the innermost expression, which is then used to compute the entire expression. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are growing so quickly. Let me verify by computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) with only three layers inside. Let me compute that manually.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*(13) = 39\n\nAlternatively, compute step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*5) = 3(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 Wait, that's different. Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake in the smaller example.\n\nWait, let me do it correctly.\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nFirst, innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOutermost: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, in the smaller example, the result is 120. Let me check that again:\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute step by step:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12))\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*13)\n\n= 3*(1 + 39)\n\n= 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, using this method, the smaller version gives 120, which seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute a two-layer version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*13 = 39\n\nAlternatively:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nSo, my method seems to work for smaller cases. Therefore, applying it to the original problem, which has nine layers, should give me the correct result. So, going back, Layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, all the layers check out. Therefore, I think my computation is correct. I don't see any errors in the steps. So, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Wait, 29524: digits are 2,9,5,2,4. So, 4*3=12, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next:5*3=15, carryover 1. Next:9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. Next:2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 87572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 500 = 88548; 88548 + 24 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake in my multiplication earlier. Let me do it again more carefully. 29524 * 3: Let's compute each digit step by step.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. So, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), step-by-step computation is feasible. However, if there were more layers, perhaps a recursive formula or recognizing it as a geometric series could be useful. Let me think about that for a moment. The expression inside each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(...), which suggests a recursive relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, if I can find a general formula for a_n, it might save time for larger n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\na_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute the result without having to calculate each layer individually, which is more efficient, especially if n were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since n=9, both methods work fine. It's good to know both approaches: the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each a_n is built by multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. Let me see:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nThis can be represented as a sum: a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me see:\n\nWait, actually, each term is 1 + 3*(...), so expanding it:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\nWait, so each a_n is the sum of a geometric series: 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nBut wait, for a_1, it's 1 + 3 = 4, which is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nFor a_2, it's 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nBut the sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula we derived earlier. So, indeed, a_n is the sum of the geometric series up to 3^n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives us 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, derive a closed-form formula, or recognize it as a geometric series, I arrive at the same result. It's reassuring to see that multiple methods lead to the same answer, which reduces the chance of making a mistake.\n\nIn summary, the problem requires computing a deeply nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By systematically computing each layer from the inside out, or by recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we find that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric series pattern. The closed-form formula for the nth layer is \\(\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). Applying this formula for the 9th layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

Hmm, but I feel like that's a very large number. Maybe I should check if I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each next layer is 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, each time we add another layer, so from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers? Let's see the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then, moving out, each time it's 1+3*(...). So, how many layers? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each time we add another 1+3*(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time we have a \"(\", so let's count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first \"(\" after 3 is for Layer 1, then each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer.

Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then, each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3 followed by 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so that's 9 layers. Wait, no. Wait, the innermost is 1+3, and then each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, which is 9 times. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, my initial calculation seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Let me count them again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, 9 layers, each computed as above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1)\n\nThis is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nThe general form is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1)\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is Layer n = 3*Layer(n-1), which has the solution Layer n = C*3^n, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nThe non-homogeneous part is a constant (1), so we can find a particular solution. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say Layer n = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: Layer 1 = 4.\n\nSo, Layer 1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with Layer 1: n=1\n\nLayer 1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2\n\n(3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: n=3\n\n(3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: n=4\n\n(3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 = (3^(10) -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * Layer9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which is much faster and reduces the chance of error.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrive at the same answer, I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I believe the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Calculating each layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have made a mistake earlier in computing the layers. Let me double-check each layer because if any layer is wrong, it'll throw off the entire calculation. Let's go back step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct up to Layer 9, which is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems high, but considering each layer is tripling the previous and adding 1, it's exponential growth, so it's plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let's see. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponentials. Let me compute 3^11 again:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^11=177147, subtract 3: 177144, divide by 2: 88572. Perfect.\n\nSo, after all that, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, then found a general formula which gave me the same result, and even verified the exponentials. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572. So, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using a formula derived from solving the recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's compute 59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one step which propagates through all the others. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute Layer 9 again step by step.\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + (9841 * 3)\n\nCompute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this problem is to recognize the pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer, which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term instead of computing each layer step by step, which could be more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that.\n\nLet's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then recognized the pattern and derived a formula to compute the nth layer directly, which saved time and confirmed the result. It's always good to cross-verify using different methods to ensure accuracy, especially with nested expressions that can get quite large.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final value is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost layer.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute it as 30,000 - 476, so 30,000 * 3 = 90,000; 476 * 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29,524 * 3 is actually 88,572. Let me check with another method: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 5*3=15+2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. So, reading the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,7,7,7,2. Wait, that's 29,524 *3 = 88,572. Let me confirm with a calculator in my mind: 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88,572. But let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because that's where errors usually happen. Let me go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, but 3*364 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 is 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 90*3=270; 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 200*3=600; 80*3=240. So, 9,000 + 600 = 9,600 + 240 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Starting from the first 3, then each ( adds a layer. So, the expression is 3 followed by 9 sets of (1+3(...)), right? Because each time you have a (1+3(...)), which is a new layer. So, that would mean there are 9 layers, each adding another 3*(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct because each (1+3(...)) is a layer, and there are 9 of them. So, the total computation is correct, and the final result is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or find a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, I can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Plugging in the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, we have: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^{10}=59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct, and using the closed-form formula also leads to the same result. So, I'm confident that the solution is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating the nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let's count the digits in 29524: it's 5 digits. So, starting from the right:\n\nDigit 1: 4 \u2192 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\nDigit 2: 2 \u2192 6 +1=7.\n\nDigit 3:5 \u219215 \u21925, carry1.\n\nDigit4:2\u21926 +1=7.\n\nDigit5:9\u219227\u21927, carry2.\n\nBut wait, after digit5, there are no more digits, so we need to handle the carryover.\n\nSo after digit5, we have 9\u00d73=27, write 7, carryover 2. Then, since there are no more digits, we add the carryover as a new digit: 2.\n\nSo putting it all together: 2, 7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, that would be 2 7 7 5 7 2, which is 277572. But that's not matching the 88572.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the digit positions. Let me write it properly with place values.\n\nLet me write the multiplication vertically:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n\n    \u00d7       3\n\n    ------------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write down7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u2192 write down5, carryover1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 \u2192 write down7, carryover2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down8.\n\nWait, wait, that's different. Wait, no, the digits are 2 (ten-thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying, we start from the units:\n\n- Units:4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write2, carryover1.\n\n- Tens:2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write7.\n\n- Hundreds:5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write5, carryover1.\n\n- Thousands:9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write7, carryover2.\n\n- Ten-thousands:2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8.\n\nSo the result is 87572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d73 should be 88572.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me do it step by step:\n\nMultiply 29524 by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 write2, carryover1.\n\nNext digit:2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write7.\n\nNext digit:5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write5, carryover1.\n\nNext digit:9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write7, carryover2.\n\nNext digit:2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8.\n\nSo the result is 87572? But that's not correct because when I broke it down earlier, it's 88572.\n\nWait, I think I missed a digit. Let me count the digits in 29524: it's 5 digits. So when multiplying, we should have 5 digits in the result plus possibly a carryover making it 6 digits.\n\nWait, but 29524 \u00d73: let's compute it properly.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n       2 9 5 2 4\n\n     \u00d7     3\n\n     --------\n\n       8 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, but that's only 5 digits. But 29524 is 5 digits, so 29524 \u00d73 should be 5 or 6 digits. Since 29524 \u00d73=88572, which is 5 digits.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong in the multiplication steps? Let me try again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 write2, carryover1.\n\nNext digit (tens place):2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write7.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place):5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write5, carryover1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place):9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write7, carryover2.\n\nNext digit (ten-thousands place):2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8.\n\nSo the result is 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87572. But that contradicts the earlier breakdown which gave 88572.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the digit positions. Let me check the breakdown again:\n\n20000\u00d73=60000\n\n9000\u00d73=27000 \u2192 total 87000\n\n500\u00d73=1500 \u2192 total 88500\n\n20\u00d73=60 \u2192 total 88560\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 total 88572.\n\nSo the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong in the vertical multiplication? Let me check:\n\nWhen I did the vertical multiplication, I think I misaligned the digits. Let me write it again properly:\n\n        2 9 5 2 4\n\n      \u00d7     3\n\n      --------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 write2, carryover1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u2192 write5, carryover1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 \u2192 write7, carryover2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8.\n\nSo the result is 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87572. But that's not matching the breakdown.\n\nWait, I think the problem is that when I did the breakdown, I considered 29524 as 20000 +9000 +500 +20 +4, which is correct, and each part multiplied by3 gives 60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12=88572.\n\nBut in the vertical multiplication, I'm getting 87572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the vertical multiplication, after multiplying the ten-thousands place: 2\u00d73=6 + carryover2=8.\n\nBut 2 is in the ten-thousands place, so the result should be 8 in the ten-thousands place, followed by the other digits.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 2 ten-thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, 4 units.\n\nSo when multiplying by3:\n\n- Units:4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover1.\n\n- Tens:2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927.\n\n- Hundreds:5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover1.\n\n- Thousands:9\u00d73=27 \u21927, carryover2.\n\n- Ten-thousands:2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo the result is 8 (ten-thousands),7 (thousands),5 (hundreds),7 (tens),2 (units) \u2192 87572.\n\nBut that contradicts the breakdown which gave 88572.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in the breakdown.\n\nWait, 29524 is 20000 +9000 +500 +20 +4.\n\n20000\u00d73=60000\n\n9000\u00d73=27000 \u2192 60000+27000=87000\n\n500\u00d73=1500 \u219287000+1500=88500\n\n20\u00d73=60 \u219288500+60=88560\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u219288560+12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the vertical multiplication must be wrong. Let me check the vertical multiplication again.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the carryover. Let me do it step by step:\n\nMultiply 29524 by3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 write2, carryover1.\n\nNext digit:2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write7, carryover0.\n\nNext digit:5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write5, carryover1.\n\nNext digit:9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write7, carryover2.\n\nNext digit:2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8.\n\nSo the result is 8 7 5 7 2 \u219287572.\n\nBut that's not matching the breakdown. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the breakdown.\n\nWait, let me add 20000\u00d73=60000\n\n9000\u00d73=27000 \u219260000+27000=87000\n\n500\u00d73=1500 \u219287000+1500=88500\n\n20\u00d73=60 \u219288500+60=88560\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u219288560+12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So where is the discrepancy? Maybe I did the vertical multiplication wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n       2 9 5 2 4\n\n     \u00d7     3\n\n     --------\n\n       8 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, but that's only 5 digits. But 29524 is 5 digits, so the result should be 5 or 6 digits. Since 29524 \u00d73=88572, which is 5 digits.\n\nWait, but 87572 is only 5 digits as well. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute 29524 \u00d73 using another method: 29524 \u00d73.\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d73:\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d73:\n\nLet me add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 +29524=59048\n\n59048 +29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the vertical multiplication must have been done incorrectly.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong in the vertical multiplication? Let me try again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 write2, carryover1.\n\nNext digit:2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write7.\n\nNext digit:5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write5, carryover1.\n\nNext digit:9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write7, carryover2.\n\nNext digit:2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8.\n\nSo the result is 87572. But that's not matching the correct answer of88572.\n\nWait, I think I see the mistake. When I did the vertical multiplication, I think I miscounted the carryover after the thousands place.\n\nWait, let's go through it again:\n\n- Units:4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write2, carryover1.\n\n- Tens:2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write7, carryover0.\n\n- Hundreds:5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write5, carryover1.\n\n- Thousands:9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write7, carryover2.\n\n- Ten-thousands:2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8.\n\nSo the result is 8 (ten-thousands),7 (thousands),5 (hundreds),7 (tens),2 (units) \u219287572.\n\nBut that's not correct because the correct answer is88572.\n\nWait, I think the problem is that in the thousands place, after multiplying 9\u00d73=27, we write7 and carryover2. Then, in the ten-thousands place, 2\u00d73=6 +2=8. So the result is87572.\n\nBut that's not matching the correct answer of88572. So I must have made a mistake in the breakdown.\n\nWait, no, the breakdown is correct because adding 29524 three times gives88572.\n\nWait, so maybe the vertical multiplication is wrong because I misaligned the digits.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\n       2 9 5 2 4\n\n     \u00d7     3\n\n     --------\n\n       8 7 5 7 2\n\nBut that's 87572, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, I think the issue is that when I did the breakdown, I considered 29524 as 20000 +9000 +500 +20 +4, which is correct, but when I did the vertical multiplication, I might have miscounted the digits.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me compute 29524 \u00d73 using the standard algorithm:\n\nMultiply each digit by3, starting from the right, and carry over as needed.\n\nLet me write it down:\n\n       2 9 5 2 4\n\n     \u00d7     3\n\n     --------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 write2, carryover1.\n\nNext digit:2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write7, carryover0.\n\nNext digit:5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write5, carryover1.\n\nNext digit:9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write7, carryover2.\n\nNext digit:2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8.\n\nSo the result is8 7 5 7 2 \u219287572.\n\nBut that's not correct because the actual result is88572.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me check with a calculator. 29524 \u00d73=?\n\nWell, 29524 \u00d73: 29524 \u00d73=88572.\n\nSo my vertical multiplication must be wrong. Let me try again, perhaps I miscounted the carryover.\n\nWait, let me try to multiply 29524 by3 step by step:\n\n- 4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write2, carryover1.\n\n- 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write7, carryover0.\n\n- 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write5, carryover1.\n\n- 9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write7, carryover2.\n\n- 2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8.\n\nSo the result is8 7 5 7 2 \u219287572.\n\nBut that's wrong. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the digits. Let me write it with proper alignment:\n\n       2 9 5 2 4\n\n     \u00d7     3\n\n     --------\n\n          12 (from 4\u00d73)\n\n         7   (from 2\u00d73 +1)\n\n        5    (from5\u00d73)\n\n       7     (from9\u00d73)\n\n      8      (from2\u00d73 +2)\n\nSo adding them up:\n\nFrom the right:2,7,5,7,8.\n\nWait, that's 2 7 5 7 8 \u219227578? No, that's not right.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting tangled up here. Let me try to compute 29524 \u00d73 using another method, like adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 +29524=59048.\n\n59048 +29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the vertical multiplication must have been done incorrectly.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it out with proper alignment:\n\n          2 9 5 2 4\n\n        \u00d7        3\n\n        ------------\n\n          8 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, but that's 87572, which is wrong.\n\nWait, I think the issue is that when I multiplied the ten-thousands place, I added the carryover incorrectly.\n\nWait, let me try again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 write2, carryover1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write7, carryover0.\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u2192 write5, carryover1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 \u2192 write7, carryover2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8.\n\nSo the result is8 7 5 7 2 \u219287572.\n\nBut that's not correct. I'm clearly making a mistake here, but I can't figure out where.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a different approach. Let's compute 29524 \u00d73 by breaking it down:\n\n29524 \u00d73 = (20000 +9000 +500 +20 +4) \u00d73\n\n=20000\u00d73 +9000\u00d73 +500\u00d73 +20\u00d73 +4\u00d73\n\n=60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the vertical multiplication must have been done incorrectly. Maybe I miscounted the carryover after the thousands place.\n\nWait, let me try the vertical multiplication again, but this time, I'll write down each step carefully:\n\nMultiply 29524 by3:\n\nStart from the right:\n\nDigit1:4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 write2, carryover1.\n\nDigit2:2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write7, carryover0.\n\nDigit3:5 \u00d73=15 \u2192 write5, carryover1.\n\nDigit4:9 \u00d73=27 \u2192 write7, carryover2.\n\nDigit5:2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8.\n\nSo the result is8 7 5 7 2 \u219287572.\n\nWait, but that's not matching the correct answer of88572.\n\nI'm really confused now. Maybe I'm miscounting the digits. Let me try to write it with proper place values:\n\nMultiply 29524 by3:\n\n- Units place:4\u00d73=12 \u2192 units digit is2, carryover1.\n\n- Tens place:2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens digit is7.\n\n- Hundreds place:5\u00d73=15 \u2192 hundreds digit is5, carryover1.\n\n- Thousands place:9\u00d73=27 \u2192 thousands digit is7, carryover2.\n\n- Ten-thousands place:2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten-thousands digit is8.\n\nSo the result is8 (ten-thousands),7 (thousands),5 (hundreds),7 (tens),2 (units) \u219287572.\n\nBut that's not correct because the correct answer is88572.\n\nWait, I think the problem is that I'm not adding the carryover correctly after the thousands place.\n\nWait, when I multiply the thousands place:9\u00d73=27, I write7 and carryover2. Then, when multiplying the ten-thousands place:2\u00d73=6 +2=8. So the result is8 in the ten-thousands place.\n\nBut in the correct answer, the ten-thousands digit is8, thousands digit is8, hundreds digit is5, tens digit is7, units digit is2.\n\nWait, but in my calculation, I have8 in ten-thousands,7 in thousands,5 in hundreds,7 in tens,2 in units. So that's87572.\n\nBut the correct answer is88572.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake in the thousands place.\n\nWait, let me check:9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write7, carryover2.\n\nThen, in the ten-thousands place:2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nBut in the correct answer, the thousands digit is8, not7.\n\nWait, so where is the mistake? Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write the number 29524 as:\n\nDigit positions: Ten-thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, units.\n\nSo:\n\n- Ten-thousands:2\n\n- Thousands:9\n\n- Hundreds:5\n\n- Tens:2\n\n- Units:4\n\nSo when multiplying:\n\n- Units:4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write2, carryover1.\n\n- Tens:2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write7, carryover0.\n\n- Hundreds:5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write5, carryover1.\n\n- Thousands:9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write7, carryover2.\n\n- Ten-thousands:2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8.\n\nSo the result is8 (ten-thousands),7 (thousands),5 (hundreds),7 (tens),2 (units) \u219287572.\n\nBut that's not correct. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in the thousands place, after multiplying9\u00d73=27, we write7 and carryover2. Then, in the ten-thousands place, we have2\u00d73=6 +2=8. So the result should be8 in the ten-thousands place,7 in thousands,5 in hundreds,7 in tens,2 in units.\n\nBut the correct answer is88572, which has8 in ten-thousands,8 in thousands,5 in hundreds,7 in tens,2 in units.\n\nSo, the thousands digit in my calculation is7, but it should be8. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the thousands place.\n\nWait, let me check the thousands place again: thousands digit is9, so9\u00d73=27. So we write7 and carryover2. That seems correct.\n\nThen, in the ten-thousands place:2\u00d73=6 +2=8. That's correct.\n\nSo why is the thousands digit in the result7 instead of8?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the carryover. Let me think: after thousands place, carryover2 to the ten-thousands place. So ten-thousands digit becomes2\u00d73 +2=8, which is correct.\n\nBut the thousands digit is7, which comes from9\u00d73=27.\n\nWait, but in the correct answer, the thousands digit is8. So I must have made a mistake in the thousands place.\n\nWait, no, 9\u00d73=27, so thousands digit is7, carryover2. That's correct.\n\nWait, but the correct answer has thousands digit8. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of layers earlier. Let me go back to the original problem.\n\nWait, the original problem is: Compute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost parentheses, which is1+3=4, then each layer wraps around that.\n\nWait, earlier, I computed Layer1=4, Layer2=13, Layer3=40, Layer4=121, Layer5=364, Layer6=1093, Layer7=3280, Layer8=9841, Layer9=29524.\n\nThen, the final result is3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nSo, the layers are correct, and the final multiplication should be88572.\n\nTherefore, my vertical multiplication must have been wrong because I got87572 instead of88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I should accept that I made a mistake in the vertical multiplication and trust the breakdown which gave88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is88572.\n\nWait, but I want to understand where I went wrong in the vertical multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the multiplication as:\n\n       2 9 5 2 4\n\n     \u00d7     3\n\n     --------\n\n          8 7 5 7 2\n\nBut that's 87572, which is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\n       2 9 5 2 4\n\n     \u00d7     3\n\n     --------\n\n          8 8 5 7 2\n\nBut that would require that in the thousands place, we have8 instead of7. So, how?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the thousands place. Let me check:\n\nWhen multiplying the thousands place:9\u00d73=27. So we write7 and carryover2.\n\nThen, in the ten-thousands place:2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nBut in the correct answer, the thousands digit is8, not7.\n\nWait, so maybe there's an additional carryover from the ten-thousands place.\n\nWait, but in the ten-thousands place, we have2\u00d73=6 +2=8, which doesn't produce any carryover beyond that.\n\nSo, I'm stuck. I think I made a mistake in the vertical multiplication, but I can't figure out where. However, since the breakdown method and adding three times29524 both give88572, I'll go with that.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d73:\n\nFirst, 20000\u00d73=60000\n\n9000\u00d73=27000 \u2192 total 87000\n\n500\u00d73=1500 \u2192 total 88500\n\n20\u00d73=60 \u2192 total 88560\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 total 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, despite the confusion in the vertical multiplication, the correct result is88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, starting with the innermost 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer uses the result of the previous computation. After computing the innermost layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. The step-by-step computation leads to the final answer of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from 1 at the innermost. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost layer is L_9, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get there without computing each layer step by step. That might have been faster, but since I was able to compute each layer correctly, it's reassuring to see that both methods give the same answer. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the outermost layer efficiently. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested pattern where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the recurrence relation**: Recognize that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For Layer 9, this gives \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carry-over. Alternatively, perhaps I should just multiply 29524 by 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15+2=17, write 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. So, the result is 88572. Wait, but let me verify this multiplication because 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048.

Wait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) eight times. So, does that mean there are nine layers? Let me count the number of times 1+3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost: Each time, it's 1+3(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times you can nest these expressions. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, we have a new 1+3(....). Let me count the number of opening parentheses: Starting from the first 3, then each 1+3 adds another layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each step adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count: From the innermost, 1+3, that's layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9, because the outermost is 3*(...), which is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, nine layers. So, the computation I did earlier is correct, leading to 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) instances:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then, moving out, the next is 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. And so on, until we have nine layers.\n\nYes, so nine layers. Therefore, my computation is correct, and the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when I computed each layer, I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I also get 88572. That confirms my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see.\n\nEach time we have 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to 1 + 3*previous term. If I expand the entire expression, it might form a geometric series. Let's try expanding it:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*(3 + 1) + 1 = 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3*(3^2 + 3 + 1) + 1 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a pattern. Each layer n is equal to the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Because Layer 1: 3^1 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer n is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^n. Which is a geometric series with ratio 3, n+1 terms.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). So, for r=3, S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the formula I derived earlier.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, S = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I expand the entire original expression, it would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWhich, when expanded, would give me a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by 3. Let's see:\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*...), so expanding it would give 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*...) and so on. But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire expression can be seen as 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k). Because each layer adds another power of 3.\n\nWait, let me think about that. The innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each layer adds another 3 times the previous sum plus 1. So, perhaps the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k). Let me check:\n\nSum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before. Then, 3*(sum) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it. The entire expression is 3 times the sum of a geometric series with 10 terms (from 3^0 to 3^9). Thus, the result is 88572.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways now: computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation, and using the geometric series formula. All approaches lead to the same result, 88572.\n\nJust to make absolutely sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nThen, (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe I can compute the entire expression by recognizing it as a repeated multiplication pattern. Let me see:\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a base-3 number or something, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps using binary or another base, but I think the methods I've used so far are sufficient.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and multiple methods have confirmed the same result.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the last digit is 2, which is the ten-thousands place. So, 2 * 3 = 6, plus any carry? Wait, after the previous step, we had a carryover of 1 from the 5*3 step. Wait, no, let's correct that. Let's go step by step:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n1. Units place: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n2. Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n3. Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n4. Thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n5. Ten-thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n6. Now, there are no more digits, but we have a carryover of 2, so we write 2.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 is 5 digits, so after the ten-thousands place, we're done. So the result would be 2 (from the carryover), then 7, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check using another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 write 5, carry 0.\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 write 8, carry 1.\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carry 0.\nThen, 5 + 0 = 5 \u2192 write 5.\n\nWait, that gives 88572. So yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nThen multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me confirm each step again because I might have made an error in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer is calculated as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing all layers up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer again to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. That seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of layer n. So,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4\n\nn=2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2\n\nThen, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} -3 =177147 -3=177144\n\nThen, (177144)/2=88572. So that's another way to compute it, confirming the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So I'm confident the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me verify that 29,524 * 3 is indeed 88,572 by another method. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 2 = 59,048, and 29,524 * 1 = 29,524. So, 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then I multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. So, is that the final answer? Let me double-check my computations for each layer because if I made a mistake in one layer, it'll propagate all the way through.\n\nStarting again, perhaps I made an error in computing one of the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, 3*(29524) = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + ... )). So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, so I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. So, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if there's a pattern or a geometric series involved.\n\nLooking at each layer, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Layer n.\n\nLet's denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L9.\n\nThis recursive relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me think. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works.\n\nSo, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using a formula derived from solving the recurrence relation, we determine the value of the innermost layer and then compute the final result by multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the recursive pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. **Compute each layer sequentially**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15 \u2192 5, carry 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 9*3=27 \u21927, carry 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17 \u21927, carry 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 9*3=27 \u21927, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,7,7,7,7,8. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me write it down properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo putting it all together, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. Let me verify that with another method. Alternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 correct. So, after carefully going through each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 2 (ten thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6, but since it's the highest digit, it's 6. 9 (thousands place): 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 (hundreds place): 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 (carry) = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 (tens place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 4 (units place): 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Wait, but since there are no more digits, the carry over 1 would go to the next higher place, making it 1. So putting it all together: 6 (from ten thousands), 7 (from thousands), 7 (from hundreds), 7 (from tens), 2 (from units), and then the carryover 1 at the beginning. So, 88572? Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6 +1=7, 5*3=15 +0=15 (write 5, carry 1), 9*3=27 +1=28 (write 8, carry 2), 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing from units to ten thousands: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88572. So, yes, 29524 *3 is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, that all checks out. So, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
