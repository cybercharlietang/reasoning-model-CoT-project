Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me check: The innermost is layer 1: a_1 = 4, then layer 2 is a_2, up to layer 9: a_9. So according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049.

Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with our earlier computations.

Now apply initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.

Now, our problem has 9 layers. Wait, actually, let me clarify: the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step. That's more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, either method works. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just verify with another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 threes. So, it's 3 times a sum where each term is 3 raised to some power. But perhaps that's complicating it. Alternatively, using the formula we derived, it's straightforward. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct, as before. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute one more layer manually to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the recurrence. Let's compute a_4 using both the step-by-step and the formula. Step-by-step: a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Formula: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct. Similarly, a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Which is what I had. So, the formula is correct, and thus the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, which also gave me the same result. Either way, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows us to derive a closed-form formula, confirming the result. The final computation gives the answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. Therefore, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2.

Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.

So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I were to compute this without using the formula, I could recognize that each layer is just the previous term multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent term is 3*previous +1. But in any case, since the formula gives the same result, I'm confident that 88572 is correct.
