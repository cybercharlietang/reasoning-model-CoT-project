Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572.

So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier.

Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9.

Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches a_2=13. Good. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

That's the same as we computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms our earlier result.

Let's compute a_1 using the formula: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049.

When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, but wait, let me see: The innermost layer is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, etc., up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches the earlier computation. So, that's a good check. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and since it's a linear recurrence, solving it gives a closed-form solution, which is much faster than computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since it's only 9 layers, both methods work. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just verify once more by computing each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572 Yep, that's consistent.

Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using both step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, ultimately leading to the final result after multiplying by 3. \n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => 0 = 1 + 2B => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value we computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, I can compute 3^10 to confirm: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 Yes, that's correct. So (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which gives me confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated 9 times, leading to the 9th layer being 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. So, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.
