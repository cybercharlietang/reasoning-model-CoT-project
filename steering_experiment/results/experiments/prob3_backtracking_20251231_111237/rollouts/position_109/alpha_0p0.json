    "text": " A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract B from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just check the calculations once more to be thorough.

Yep, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.

So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works.

Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049.

So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I computed earlier. So, this method also gives the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), which can be seen as each term being multiplied by 3 and adding 1. This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio, in this case, 3, plus a constant term. The formula for such a series is known, and as I derived earlier, it's a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, using this formula for n=9 gives the same result. Therefore, both methods lead to the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct. So, to recap, I started by computing each layer step by step, which took me through 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, starting from the innermost 1 + 3. Then, I double-checked my work by deriving a closed-form formula for the nth layer, which gave me the same result. Finally, I multiplied the outermost layer by 3 to get the final answer. Throughout this process, I made sure to verify each step to avoid arithmetic errors, especially since the numbers get quite large. It's easy to make a mistake in multiplication with such large numbers, so taking it step by step and double-checking each layer was essential. I also considered alternative methods, like using recurrence relations, to confirm the result, which is a good practice when dealing with nested expressions or sequences. In conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying my results using a different method, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

But B = -1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I didn't realize the recurrence, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so each layer is growing exponentially. But computing each step manually also worked. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that. 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before! So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.

So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the initial terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.
