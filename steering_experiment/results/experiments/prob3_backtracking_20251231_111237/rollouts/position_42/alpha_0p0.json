Then, 3 * 29524: Let's compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if there's a formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote the innermost term as a1, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on up to a9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. This is similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, actually, a1 is the innermost term, which is 1 + 3, so a1 = 4. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as before. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found as a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution is needed. Let's solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4. When n=1: a1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches a2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a3=40. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Thus, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches the step-by-step computation. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to calculate each layer. That's more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we can use the formula for the nth term of such a sequence. The innermost term is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Using the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), where \\( n = 9 \\), we find the innermost value and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\n2. **Use the recurrence formula**: The nth term \\( a_n \\) can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the innermost term**: For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times \\( a_9 \\), so \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Let me see if there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Plugging in the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} Let's assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the equation: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2 So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an error when dealing with so many layers. Let me go back through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but in my earlier steps, Layer 1 was 4, Layer 2 was 13, etc. So, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. But wait, if I think of this as a geometric series, maybe I can find a closed-form formula instead of computing each layer manually. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio. But in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation of r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. At n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead me to the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572. Let me just check once more using another approach, perhaps by expanding the expression step by step. Let me write the entire expression again, but replacing each inner expression with its computed value.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as Layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me see if that's possible. The recursive relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's also compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution, L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substituting A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula, but since I was able to compute each layer step by step without error, I think that's solid. Another way to think about it is that each layer is effectively building a geometric progression. Each time, you're adding 1 and then scaling by 3, which is similar to expanding a geometric series. But in this case, since it's finite (only 9 layers), the step-by-step approach works fine. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything: 1. Identify the structure: each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). 2. Start from the innermost layer (Layer 1) and compute each subsequent layer up to Layer 9. 3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3 to get the final answer. 4. Verified each layer's computation and cross-checked with a general formula for the recurrence relation. 5. Both methods led to the same result, so the answer is consistent. Therefore, I'm pretty sure that the computed value is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, let's find a homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has solution A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier values to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. This seems to be a geometric sequence or something similar, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the innermost is layer 1, so the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my previous calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

    "text": " 3 * 20 = 60 3 * 4 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, the total would be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I might have made an error somewhere. Let me go back and check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, multiplying that by 3: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, yes, 88,572 seems to be the correct result. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, the result is 88,572. That matches my previous calculation. Hmm, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I think I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this problem as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but given that it's only nine layers deep, computing each layer step by step seems manageable and less error-prone than trying to find a general formula, especially since I might not remember the exact formula for such a nested expression. But just for fun, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could represent this. Let me think: Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This looks like a linear recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*a^n, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, can be found by assuming a constant solution L_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, using the formula also leads me to the same answer, which is reassuring. This problem, while appearing complex with all those nested parentheses, can be efficiently solved by recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the linear recurrence relation. But since the number of layers is manageable, computing each step manually is also feasible, albeit a bit time-consuming and prone to arithmetic errors if one isn't careful. In any case, both methods lead to the same result, so I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward until we reach the outermost layer. Multiplying the result of the outermost layer by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute from the innermost layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 27 + any carry, but there's a carryover of 2 from the previous step? Wait, no, let me do it properly:\n\nActually, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, the carryover 2 becomes 27. So, writing it all together: 27,752? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88,572, as I thought earlier. Wait, no, actually, when I write it step by step:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNow, since we're at the end, write the carryover 2 as 27. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, that's 88,572. So, that's correct. Hmm, so my initial calculation was right. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each layer again.\n\nWait, let me check Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093 \u00d7 3 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280 \u00d7 3: 3000\u00d73=9000, 280\u00d73=840, so 9000+840=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841 \u00d73: 9000\u00d73=27,000, 800\u00d73=2,400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 29,523 +1 =29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 29,524 \u00d73: 29,524 \u00d73.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 \u00d73:\n\n29,524 \u00d73:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me check again how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1 +3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3(...). So, let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times 3(...) appears. From the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, because each time you go out, you add another 3(...). So, I think I did 9 layers correctly.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572, that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive formula where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, let's solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K =1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think this confirms that my step-by-step calculation was correct.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4 (correct). Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 (correct). Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 (correct). Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 (correct). Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 (correct). Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524=88572. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me think if there's a closed-form formula for this kind of recursion. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can recognize it as a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's another way to arrive at the same answer, using the recurrence relation formula. That might have saved some time instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were much larger. But for nine layers, it's manageable either way. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result.

Did I count the layers correctly? The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Counting the number of layers: Each time after the 3, there's a new (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers? Let me see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1). Layer3: 1+3*(Layer2). ... Up to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that's 9 layers inside, each adding 1+3*(previous layer), and then multiplied by 3. So, my calculation of 9 layers is correct, leading to Layer9=29524, then 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as Layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write it down:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. I can solve it to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing step by step and using the recurrence relation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication again: 29524 *3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Wait, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524). So 29524*3: Let's compute 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +72=88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering the nested multiplication by 3 each time, it might be correct. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula that can help compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on. It seems like each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is a_1, and the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, which is the same as before. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is building up a geometric series. Each term a_n = 1 + 3*(previous term). If I unroll the expression, it's similar to expanding a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. If I let the entire expression be E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) where the inner part has 8 layers. But since each layer is similar, maybe I can express E in terms of itself, but it's a bit tricky because each layer reduces the number of nested terms by one. Alternatively, since I already have a general formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and since the outermost layer is a_9, and the entire expression is 3*a_9, then E = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, this gives me further confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've checked it thoroughly enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the closed-form formula approach give the same result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.

Let me try another approach. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. I think that's correct. Maybe I can also recognize this as a geometric series or something, but given the structure, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is a linear recurrence. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2, but wait, let me check if that applies here. Wait, no, because our starting point is a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1. Hmm, maybe the formula is a bit different. Let me think. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, a_9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step follows logically, and I double-checked using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation.

Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840.

So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.

Yep, that's the same as before. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating things for just nine layers. But for practice, let me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each step. Starting again with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Hmm, same result. So maybe that's correct after all. But let me try another approach to see if I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is a recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrences of the form L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b. The solution is L(n) = a^(n) * L(0) + b*(a^(n) - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, but in our case, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, comparing, a = 3, b = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_p. So, L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents or divisions. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3 times that is 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 as 1 + 3, L2 as 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9. So, let's see if there's a recursive formula here. Let me define L(n) where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). With L(1) = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L(n). The recurrence relation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Therefore, L(9) = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution also leads me to the same answer, which is reassuring.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I think I did this correctly.

Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct).

So, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to be absolutely certain, maybe I can compute it using another method, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series, since each layer seems to be a multiple of the previous one. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with what I calculated earlier. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. But in this case, since it's nested, it's a bit different, but the recurrence relation approach worked well. So, yeah, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier computations. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But wait, let me count the number of layers again to make sure I didn't miss any or count extra. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3 (Layer 1)\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3) (Layer 2)\n3. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3)) (Layer 3)\n...\nContinuing until Layer 9: 1+3(1+3(1+3(...))) with 9 layers.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 9 layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, my earlier computation of Layer 9 being 29524 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this problem. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, the sequence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my earlier step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to verify using a different method to ensure there are no mistakes. So, whether I compute each layer manually or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the key steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n3. After computing up to Layer 9, multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n4. As a check, derive a formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations, confirming that the value at Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\n5. Multiply by 3 to get the final answer, 88572.\n\nThroughout this process, it's important to keep track of each step and verify the computations, especially since it's easy to make arithmetic errors with large numbers. Using the formula provided an excellent way to cross-verify the results, ensuring accuracy.\n\nAnother thing I might consider is whether there's a more efficient way to compute this, perhaps by recognizing a geometric series or another mathematical pattern. But given the structure of the problem, the recursive approach seems the most straightforward.\n\nIn summary, by methodically breaking down each layer and verifying with a mathematical formula, I arrived at the solution without any errors. It's a good reminder of how recognizing patterns and using recurrence relations can simplify what initially looks like a complex problem.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we find its value to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the ninth layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me verify that computation because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So writing it out: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, putting it all together, each layer is computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. After computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, multiplying by 3 gives the final answer of 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors in computation. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=13. Layer3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1 +3*40=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to compute this without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 +3 =4. Then, a_{n} = 1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Specifically, since each term is a linear function of the previous term, we can write a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 +3*K => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. This method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. But since there are only nine layers, both methods work fine. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just do a quick sanity check. Each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so the numbers should be growing exponentially. Starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, etc., each time roughly tripling. 3^9 is 19683, but since each layer is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, at n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which is about 59049/2, so that's correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives us about 88572, which is 3*29524. Yep, that seems right. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer triples the previous value and adds 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 3 * 20 = 60 3 * 4 = 12 Now, adding them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, putting it all together, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (That's correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct)\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. But wait, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using a formula for a geometric series or something? Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then we can see a pattern here. Let me write down the general formula for such a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find A and B. When n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for the homogeneous solution, as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate unless A is zero. But in our case, since we have a finite number of layers, maybe we can find a closed-form expression. Alternatively, let's compute a few terms to see if we can spot a pattern:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Each term is 1 more than three times the previous term. So, indeed, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The closed-form solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's test for n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 =1. But a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe my formula is off. Let's derive it properly.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1 =4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1. Solving for A: A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4=3C -1/2. Solving for C: 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the exponent. 3^10 is indeed 59049, right? Let me compute 3^10 step by step:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked all my steps, so I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer to see if I made a mistake. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute this again carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, that's correct. Wait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: Each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It's 1+3(...), so each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nEach time, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see, starting from the innermost, which is just 1+3, that's one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, in the original expression, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses: Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the first 3(, then inside, 1+3(, then inside that, another 1+3(, and so on. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3(\n\nWait, but in the original expression, after the first 3(, how many more 1+3( are there? Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3(, there are 8 more 1+3( before the innermost 1+3. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that, so total layers would be 9? Because the innermost is layer 1, then each subsequent is a new layer, so layer 9 is the outermost. Wait, but when I computed earlier, I had 9 layers, starting from 1+3 up to 1+3*(Layer 8). So, that would mean that the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each next layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me define it as a recurrence relation. Let a_n be the value of the nth layer, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, let's compute the terms up to a_9.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me think. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it explicitly. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant. Let me find C.\n\nAssuming the steady-state solution where a_{n+1} = a_n = C.\n\nThen, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the explicit formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the explicit formula works. Therefore, a_9 =29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. So, 3*a_9=3*(59048/2)= (3*59048)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each adding another layer. So, starting from the innermost 1+3, which is layer 1, up to layer 9, which is the outermost. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but it's a bit more complicated because each term is 1 + 3*something. But since we've already solved it using the recurrence relation and verified it with the explicit formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*(a_9) again. a_9=29524. So, 29524*3: 29524*3. Let's compute it digit by digit.\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n29524*3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.

Let's compute the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can try to see if there's a pattern or perhaps a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution can be found using the formula a_n = (a_1 + d/(c-1)) * c^{n-1} - d/(c-1). In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, plugging in, we get a_n = (4 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me check this formula against the known values to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (9/2)*3^{2} - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (9/2)*27 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let me compute that. First, compute 3^8: 3^1=3\n3^2=9\n3^3=27\n3^4=81\n3^5=243\n3^6=729\n3^7=2187\n3^8=6561\n\nSo, 3^8 = 6561. Now, plug that into the formula:\n\na_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(9/2)*6561 = (9 * 6561)/2.\n\nFirst, compute 9 * 6561:\n\nCompute 6561 * 10 = 65610, then subtract 6561 to get 65610 - 6561 = 59049.\n\nSo, 9 * 6561 = 59049.\n\nThen, 59049 / 2 = 29524.5.\n\nNow, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier for a_9. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the value inside the parentheses is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*a_9, which is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but that seems really big. Let me think again: each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each layer grows by a factor of 3 plus 1. It's a geometric progression, actually. Wait, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Suppose I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ... )). It's a repeated multiplication. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. That's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. Let me find C. When n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + C = 3A + C. Let's see what happens as n increases. For n=2, a_2=13= A*3^2 + C=9A + C. So, from n=1: 3A + C = 4. From n=2: 9A + C =13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: 6A=9 => A=9/6=3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + C=4 => 9/2 + C=4 => C=4 - 9/2= -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carryover 1. 2*3 = 6 +1 =7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step is manageable. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with multiple layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. That gives me confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I can also think of this expression as a geometric series with each term being multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see: The innermost term is 1+3=4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)). If I expand the entire expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))) nine times. If I think about expanding it all the way, it would be 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with eight layers. But that might not be helpful. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. But in this case, since each layer adds another 1, it's a bit different. The formula I derived earlier is more accurate. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

    "text": " 3 * 24 = 72 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, the total would be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers step by step to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this more carefully.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original problem is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, each Layer is 1 + 3*(previous Layer). So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, if Layer 9 is 29,524, then 3*29,524 is 88,572, which is correct.\n\nBut let me check if I correctly computed each Layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all Layers seem correct. Therefore, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute it another way. Let's see if there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without expanding each layer. Because computing each layer step by step might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are many layers.\n\nLooking at the expression, each Layer n is defined as:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(Layer (n-1))\n\nWith Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nThe recurrence is: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\nL(n) = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\nL(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\nL(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Layer n, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor Layer 1: n=1\n\nL(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: n=2\n\nL(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: n=3\n\nL(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: n=4\n\nL(4)= (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: n=5\n\nL(5)= (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: n=6\n\nL(6)= (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: n=7\n\nL(7)= (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: n=8\n\nL(8)= (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: n=9\n\nL(9)= (3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*L(9), and L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2\n\n3^11 is 177,147, so:\n\n(177,147 -3)/2 = 177,144 /2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, this confirms that the answer is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking down each layer from the innermost to the outermost and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a pattern. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we efficiently compute the result, leading to the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"
