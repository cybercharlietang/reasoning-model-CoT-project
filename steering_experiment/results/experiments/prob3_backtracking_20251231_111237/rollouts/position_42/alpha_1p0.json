Let me verify that multiplication again because 29524 is a big number. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing up to Layer 9, which gives 29524, multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is finite (9 layers), computing each step is straightforward. However, for practice, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, reading it from the top: 88572. So, yes, 88572 is correct. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because that seems like a huge number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers.

Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but maybe I should try a different approach to verify. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or some pattern. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. To find B, we can set up the equation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, set the left and right sides equal: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, the value is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, the innermost expression, which is Layer 9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3)...))). So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. But since it's nested, it's more like a geometric progression with multiple layers. However, using the formula we derived earlier, each layer n gives a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for the innermost layer, n=1, and for each subsequent layer, n increases by 1. Since the entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th layer, which we found to be 29524, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To be thorough, let me compute each layer again just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.

So, a_n = (4 + (1)/(3 - 1)) * 3^{n-1} - (1)/(3 - 1) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Simplifying, (9/2) * 3^{n-1} is the same as (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (9/2) * (3^{n}/3) )= (9/2) * (3^{n}/3) )= (3^{n} * 3)/2 = (3^{n+1}) / 2. Wait, that might not be the right way to simplify. Let me check again: (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (9/2) * (3^{n} / 3) )= (9/2) * (3^{n} / 3) )= (3^{n} * 3) / 2 = (3^{n+1}) / 2. Hmm, so a_n = (3^{n+1}) / 2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. That's correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step method and the recurrence relation approach led me to the same answer. So, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a recurrence relation, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute it again to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. Suppose we have an expression like a + r*(a + r*(a + r*(...))). This is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by r. The sum of such a series can be expressed as (a + r*a + r^2*a + ... + r^n*a) where n is the number of terms. But in this case, it's a bit different because each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer, where k starts from 1 as the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. So, we can write L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1} for k >= 2, with L_1 = 4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_k^h = C*3^k, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_k^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For k=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, k=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same result. So, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in adding or multiplying somewhere. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, each layer adds another 3*(previous layer). Let me count the number of layers correctly. Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), so let's count how many times 1 + 3*(... occurs. The expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that would mean 9 layers. Wait, but when I started, I thought Layer 1 was 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), etc., up to Layer 9. So, maybe I did compute up to Layer 9 correctly. But then the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. But let me verify the calculations step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but perhaps I didn't account for the initial 3 correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the layers are counted differently. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can express this as a recursive sequence. Let's define a function f(n) where f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each layer is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, f(1) = 4, f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to f(9). Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9). So, let's compute f(1) to f(9):\n\nf(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. The general form is f(n) = a*f(n-1) + b, which in this case is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1. The solution to such a recurrence relation is f(n) = (a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), but since here a=3 and the nonhomogeneous term is 1, the solution is f(n) = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that:\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 2/2 =1, but f(1) is 4, so that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test that:\n\nn=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches f(1)=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches f(2)=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches f(3)=40.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which matches f(4)=121.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364, which matches f(5)=364.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, which matches f(6)=1093.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, which matches f(7)=3280.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, which matches f(8)=9841.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches f(9)=29524.\n\nSo, the formula f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works perfectly. Therefore, f(9)=29524, and the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29524*3.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I should write it out properly.\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 *3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNow, the next digit is 2 (from 29524, which is the ten-thousands place), so 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 87572. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, 29524*3=88572? Wait, no, according to this step-by-step, it's 87572. Hmm, but earlier I thought it was 88572. I must have made a mistake in my initial multiplication.\n\nWait, let's check again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2 (from 29524, the ten-thousands place) *3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88572. That's inconsistent. Let me check with another method. Let's compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 +29524 = 88572. Wait, that's different. Wait, but 29524*3 should be 88572 because 30000*3=90000, and 29524 is 476 less than 30000, so 90000 - (476*3)=90000 -1428=88572. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572, which is wrong. So, I must have made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nSo, positions: ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, units.\n\nWait, when I multiply by 3:\n\n4 (units) *3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 (tens) *3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 (hundreds)*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 (thousands)*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 (ten thousands)*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units), which is 88572. Wait, that's correct. So, I must have miscounted the digits earlier.\n\nWait, in my initial step-by-step, I thought 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2, then 2*3=6 +2=8, so the digits would be 8 (from 2*3+2), then 7 (from 9*3=27), then 5 (from 5*3=15), then 7 (from 2*3=6+1), then 2 (from 4*3=12). So, the number would be 8 7 5 7 2, but that's only 5 digits, whereas 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the result should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Wait, but 29524*3=88572, which is 5 digits, starting with 8. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, so in my initial digit-by-digit multiplication, I think I misplaced the digits. Let me try again:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. So, the number is 88572. That's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more using another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572.

    "text": " 3 * 20 = 60 3 * 4 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again because 3 * 29524 should be straightforward. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check that because maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let's go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. So, that's correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when you do these step-by-step, it's easy to make a multiplication error. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each layer again more carefully. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient and less error-prone. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. a_3=1+3*a_2=1+39=40. a_4=1+3*a_3=1+120=121. a_5=1+3*a_4=1+363=364. a_6=1+3*a_5=1+1092=1093. a_7=1+3*a_6=1+3279=3280. a_8=1+3*a_7=1+9840=9841. a_9=1+3*a_8=1+29523=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's solve for A and B. From the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate the coefficients: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + (1 + 3B). Therefore, B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1= A*3^1 -1/2=3A -1/2=4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2=9/2. Therefore, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Now, 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, to compute 3*(3^{10}-1)/2, which is (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, 3^{11} -3=177147-3=177144. Then, divide by 2: 177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid now. I double-checked each layer, found a formula, and confirmed that the result is consistent. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final value before multiplying by 3 is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the result 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next nested term). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Final Answer**:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, perhaps breaking it down differently. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it together: 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. Wait, but let me verify with another method. Alternatively, using the standard multiplication: 29524 \u00d7 3: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me double-check the number of layers because if I have nine layers, each time I'm adding another 3*(previous layer) +1. Wait, let me recount. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time I have 1+3, and then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count how many times 1+3 is used. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time, it's 1+3(1+3(...)), so each time, the number of layers increases by one. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Starting from the innermost: 1+3. Then, moving out, each time another 1+3(...). So, let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on, until we have 9 layers. Wait, no, because each time we add a layer, we add another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost as Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it step by step again, more carefully. Let me list each layer with its value:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again. It's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, the next is 1+3(1+3)\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1+3(...)).\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3 followed by a parenthesis. Let me count the number of times 1+3 is followed by another 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3)\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nSo, each time, we're adding another layer. How many layers are there? Let me see: The expression has 9 layers because after the initial 3(1+3, there are 8 more layers of 1+3(...)). Wait, maybe not. Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of closing parentheses. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3 followed by a parenthesis. Let me count the number of times 1+3 is followed by another 1+3(...). The innermost is 1+3, then the next is 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), etc. So, the number of layers is 9 because each time, we add another layer until we reach the outermost 1+3(...)).\n\nWait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3 followed by a parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3:\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me look again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after 1+3, there's another opening parenthesis, except for the innermost one. So, how many opening parentheses are there after 1+3? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. Then, 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nSo, each layer adds one more opening parenthesis. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 expressions. Each 1+3 is followed by another 1+3(...) except for the innermost one. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then the next is 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), etc. So, the number of layers is 9 because after the initial 3(1+3, there are 8 more layers of 1+3(...)). Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Let me see:\n\nEach time, the expression is 1+3 followed by an opening parenthesis, except for the innermost one. So, the innermost is 1+3, then the next is 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), etc. So, how many times do we have 1+3 followed by an opening parenthesis? Let me count:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3(1+3, each time we have another 1+3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3:\n\n1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nWait, that can't be right because the innermost is just 1+3 without another opening parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, meaning that we have 9 instances of 1+3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Wait, but in the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each time we add another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, meaning that after the initial 3(1+3, there are 8 more layers. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the number of layers is 9, each starting from the innermost as Layer 1 up to Layer 9. So, in that case, the values I computed earlier should be correct, leading to the final answer of 88572. But just to make sure, let me recount the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, yes, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think the final answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident about this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2:1+3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3:1+3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4:1+3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5:1+3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6:1+3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f Yeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value at each layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... And so on, up to a_9. So, each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which in this case, c=1 and r=3. The closed-form solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + r^{n} * (a_0 - c/(1 - r)), but wait, since r > 1, the formula would be a bit different. Alternatively, the solution for a_n can be expressed as a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try solving the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the earlier computed layers: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10} first. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute one more layer using both the step-by-step method and the formula to ensure consistency. Let's take layer 4: Step-by-step: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*Layer3 =1 + 3*40=121. Using the formula: a_4=(3^{5}-1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect. So, the formula holds true for all layers, which gives me confidence in the result. Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is essentially building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Maybe not necessary, since the step-by-step and the recurrence relation both give the same result. So, I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Wait, actually, it's similar to the expansion of a number in base 3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. So, if I have nine layers, that would correspond to a_9, and the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, computing a_9 and then multiplying by 3 gives the result. Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9, since there are nine layers. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Now, let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1 =3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} =177147. Therefore, the expression becomes (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2 =88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I used two methods: computing each layer step by step and then using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I saw the layers, I thought maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. This expression is a form of a geometric series, perhaps? Let's see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. That recurrence relation might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. To find C, we set L_n = L_{n-1} = C, so C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works. So, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, using the formula, I can see that each layer follows L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which makes sense because each layer is a geometric progression with ratio 3. Therefore, the final result is indeed 88572. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the reasoning or calculations. It's a bit tedious to compute each layer manually, but using the recurrence relation helps confirm the result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me go through each layer again to verify: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, that seems consistent. Each step checks out, so I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... and so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we're dealing with a_9, which is the innermost layer, let's compute a_9 using this formula. a_9 = (3^{9+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before, so that's a good consistency check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I got earlier. So, this formula confirms that the result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression to see if that's possible. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let's denote the innermost expression as E_1 = 1 + 3. Then, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Similarly, E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, but when I expand E_3, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Let me see if I can express this as a sum: Each E_n can be expressed as 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, which is similar to the recursive formula before. But perhaps if I expand all the terms, I can see a pattern. Let me try expanding a few layers to see: E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nE_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\nE_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\nWait, that's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. Similarly, E_4 would be 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 = 130? Wait, no, because E_4 is 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. So, E_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, that's exactly the formula I derived earlier. So, E_n is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n. So, the sum S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for E_9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the geometric series, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think I've thoroughly checked my work here, both by step-by-step computation and by deriving a general formula using the properties of geometric series and recurrence relations. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nTo solve this, we can recognize the pattern as a recursive sequence where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}$.

Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering the expression is nested nine times, each time multiplying by 3, it might make sense. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct). Okay, seems like each step checks out. I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be used here to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. The general formula for such a recurrence relation can be found. For a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula: a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} + c/(1 - k). Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, k = 3, c = 1. Plugging into the formula, we get: a_n = (a_1 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3). Simplifying, 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. So, a_n = (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (9/2)*3^2 - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let's compute that: First, 3^8 is 6561. So, (9/2)*6561 = (9 * 6561)/2. Let me compute 9 * 6561: 6561 * 9: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. Adding those: 54000 + 4500 = 58500; 58500 + 540 = 59040; 59040 + 9 = 59049. So, (9 * 6561) = 59049. Then, 59049 / 2 = 29524.5. Then, subtracting 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct. I think I've solved the problem correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 is accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula.\n\nLet me denote the nth layer as L_n, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let's check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works.\n\nSo, since the expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Hmm, that's the same result as before. So, is 88572 the correct answer? It seems high, but considering each layer is multiplied by 3 each time, the numbers do grow exponentially. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer manually. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just verify once more to be absolutely sure. If I substitute n=9 into the closed-form formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " 3 * 20 = 60 3 * 4 = 12 Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because 3 * 29524 should be straightforward. Maybe I made a mistake in breaking it down. Alternatively, I can do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 2 * 3 = 6. So, putting it together: 88572. Hmm, that's the same result as before. But I feel like that's too large. Maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I have a feeling that the answer might be smaller. Maybe I miscounted the layers? Let me count the number of 3s in the original expression. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are nine opening parentheses, which would correspond to nine layers, right? Because each ( starts a new layer. So, that would mean Layer 1 to Layer 9, as I did before. So, perhaps 88572 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. This seems like a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for the nth term. Let me define a recurrence relation: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I did earlier. So, we're looking for a_9, and then multiplying by 3. To find a closed-form for a_n, we can solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the recurrence relation approach. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution I found is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test it for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which is correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which is correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, it's indeed 29524, and 3 times that is 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, if I didn't use the recurrence relation, and just computed each layer step by step, I also arrived at the same result, so that gives me more confidence. Therefore, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I might consider that each layer is following a pattern that can be represented recursively. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >1. So, we can compute each a_n as follows: a1=4, a2=1+3*4=13, a3=1+3*13=40, a4=1+3*40=121, a5=1+3*121=364, a6=1+3*364=1093, a7=1+3*1093=3280, a8=1+3*3280=9841, a9=1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems to confirm the earlier result. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C. Solving for C: C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1= (3^{2})/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a2=(3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9= (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a9=59049/2 -1/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent as well.

    "text": " Let me break it down: 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, the total would be 88572. But wait, let me double-check that because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it together: 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Wait, 3*364 is 1092? Let me check: 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Correct. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be modeled recursively. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the problem reduces to finding a_9 where each a_n is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms that the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. I think I've thought it through thoroughly and checked my work using two different methods: step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation. Both approaches led me to the same answer, so I can be sure that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing all nine layers, we find the ninth layer to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3.

So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Okay, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might allow me to compute it without calculating each layer. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, the 3 is multiplied by the next layer. So, if I write out the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). If I expand this, it would be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms? Wait, no, because each layer is multiplied by 3, but the number of layers is nine. Let me think again. Actually, each multiplication by 3 corresponds to a level. So, the total number of terms would be 9, with each term being 3^k where k goes from 1 to 9. Wait, but I need to check. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each time you have 1 + 3*(...), so when you expand it all, it's 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to 3^8*1, because each layer adds another power of 3. Then, the entire expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is a sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k. So, that sum is (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*(9841) = 29523. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier result. Hmm, maybe I messed up somewhere. Wait, no, because in the initial problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I think of the innermost as 1 + 3, which is 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 =13, and so on up to nine layers. So, the total expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the ninth layer. As per the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's correct. But when I tried to think of it as a geometric series, I got a different result. Let me see where I went wrong. I thought that the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is a geometric series sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841. Then, 3*9841 =29523. But that's not matching. So, where is the mistake? Let me see. Maybe the number of terms is different. Let me count the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses is one layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1), up to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8). So, the expression inside the outermost 3 is Layer9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. Then, 3*a_9 =88572. So, the mistake in the geometric series approach was probably in the number of terms. Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric series but with a twist. Alternatively, maybe I can model it as a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but the initial term is 1, and each subsequent term is multiplied by 3. So, the sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. That sum is indeed (3^9 -1)/2 =9841. But then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*S'), where S' is the sum. Wait, no, because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps the sum S is not exactly the same as the geometric series. Let me think again. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote the innermost expression as x_1 =1 +3. Then, x_2 =1 +3*x_1. x_3=1 +3*x_2, etc., up to x_9. Then, E=3*x_9. So, as we saw earlier, x_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, x_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, E=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I try to write E as a sum, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)))=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)))=3*(1 +3*(E')), where E' is a similar expression but with one fewer layer. Wait, but that might not be helpful because it's recursive. Alternatively, maybe I can express E in terms of itself, but since the number of layers is finite, it's better to compute it step by step or use the formula. So, in any case, the answer seems to be 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make a calculation error when multiplying 3*29524. Let me compute 29524*3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Now, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524.

Wait, but let me verify that because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let's do that: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But let me double-check my layers because that seems like a lot of steps, and I might have made an error in one of the earlier layers. Let's go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(...). So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, yes, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final answer. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the final answer is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a recursive formula. Let's see. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, etc. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier values. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. So, that's correct. Then, the final answer is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can also think about the expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. So, expanding the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). This is a finite geometric series with 9 layers. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3, it might be more complicated. However, using the recurrence relation and the formula we derived earlier seems more straightforward. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break it down by evaluating each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.

So, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, the value would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula confirms the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step using the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding step by step is manageable. But just for fun, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute it more quickly. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. Then the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the solution to the homogeneous equation plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, I still arrive at the same answer. That's reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is growing exponentially, which makes sense because each term is multiplied by 3 each time, leading to a geometric progression. So, the innermost term is 4, then 13, 40, etc., each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. But regardless of the approach, whether expanding step by step or using the recurrence relation, the final answer is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the computed value is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So starting after the first 3, each \"1+\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So my earlier count was correct. Each layer from 1 to 9, with layer 9 being the outermost. So, the calculation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to compute this without computing each layer manually. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Let's denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's non-homogeneous. The general solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier calculation. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then we multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure that my general formula is correct by checking with the earlier layers. For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works for the initial layers, so it's likely correct for layer 9 as well. Therefore, the final result is indeed 88572.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify.

Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3.

That seems correct. Wait, but another way to check is to recognize that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me think if there's a formula for such a recurrence. Let's denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, each layer is indeed following the pattern. Now, since the entire expression is 3 times L_9, which is 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, but wait, is there a mathematical formula to compute this without having to compute each layer step by step? Maybe a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is a nested multiplication, so perhaps it's a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me see: Let's consider that each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the recurrence relation is L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_k^h = A*3^k, and the particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524.

Let me just verify that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, especially in the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the steps. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. It looks like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, we have A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers: For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n has value L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this method also gives the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recursive pattern, I might have tried expanding each layer step by step, which is what I did first. But recognizing the pattern allows me to compute it more efficiently, especially if the number of layers were larger. In this case, since there are only nine layers, even computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but having a formula is definitely more efficient. Another way to think about this is to recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that. Each term inside the parentheses can be seen as a sum of a geometric progression. Let's see: Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I think of each layer as a term in a series, it's like a1 = 1 + 3*a2, a2 = 1 + 3*a3, and so on, until a9 = 1 + 3*a10, where a10 would be... Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a1 =1 +3, which is 4. Then a2=1 +3*a1, etc., up to a9. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. So, if I unroll the expression, it's like a1 =1 +3*a2, a2=1 +3*a3,..., a9=1 +3*a10, but since a10 doesn't exist, maybe it's just 1. Wait, no, in our original problem, the innermost layer is 1 +3, so a1=4, and each subsequent a_n is 1 +3*a_{n+1}, with a9 being the outermost layer. So, perhaps it's a finite geometric series. Let me think: If I have a1 =1 +3*a2, a2=1 +3*a3,..., a9=1 +3*a10, but a10 is just 1, because there's no more layers beyond that. Wait, in our case, the innermost layer is a1=1 +3=4, and a2=1 +3*a1, etc., up to a9=1 +3*a10, but a10 would be... Wait, actually, in our problem, the innermost layer is a1=1 +3, and there are nine layers, so a9 is the outermost layer. So, perhaps the total expression is 3*a9, where a9=1 +3*a8, and so on, down to a1=4. So, it's a finite recursion with nine terms. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: Each layer can be expressed as 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I consider the outermost layer, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))). Let me see if I can express this as a sum. Let me denote S as the entire expression, so S = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me try to express S in terms of itself. Notice that inside the first parentheses, we have 1 + 3*(another expression). Let me denote the part inside the first parentheses as T. So, S = 3*T, where T =1 +3*(another expression). But wait, the structure repeats, so maybe T is similar to S but with one fewer layer. Wait, actually, S has nine layers, so T would have eight layers. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't as straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I can think of each layer as adding another term in a geometric progression. Let me try to see: Starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 +3 =4. Then the next layer is 1 +3*4=13, which is 1 +3*4. The next is 1 +3*13=40, which is 1 +3*(1 +3*4). So, it's like each layer is adding another 3 multiplied by the previous result. So, in terms of a series, each layer is 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)). So, perhaps this can be expressed as a sum: S = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) Let me see if I can express this as S =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) But this seems recursive. Wait, perhaps S can be expressed in terms of itself. Let me try that. Let me define S as the entire expression, so S =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Now, notice that inside the first parentheses, after the first 1 +3*, there's another similar expression, which is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) up to eight layers. Let me denote that inner expression as S', which is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with eight layers. So, S =3*(1 + S'), and S' =3*(1 +3*(1 +...)) with seven layers, and so on. But this might not be helpful because each S' is similar but with fewer layers. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of each layer as contributing a term in a geometric series. Let me try to expand the entire expression step by step to see if it forms a geometric series. Let me start by expanding the innermost parentheses and work outward. Starting with the innermost: 1 +3 =4. Then, moving out one layer:1 +3*4=13. Then, next layer:1 +3*13=40. Next:1 +3*40=121. Then:1 +3*121=364. Next:1 +3*364=1093. Then:1 +3*1093=3280. Next:1 +3*3280=9841. Finally:1 +3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, each step is 1 +3*previous. So, each layer is a term in the sequence where each term is 1 +3*previous. As we saw earlier, this forms a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. The general formula for such a recurrence is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we derived earlier. So, for n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the result again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to see: Each layer adds another term where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see: If I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let's try to expand this step by step:\n\nFirst, the innermost part: 1 +3 =4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer:1 +3*4=13.\n\nNext layer:1 +3*13=40.\n\nNext:1 +3*40=121.\n\nNext:1 +3*121=364.\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, each step is 1 +3*previous, which we've already established.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 0 to 9, but I'm not sure. Let me try to see:\n\nIf I write the entire expression out, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let's try to distribute the 3s:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\nLet me compute the innermost first:\n\n=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4))))))) \n\nWait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, each time we have 1 +3*something, which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see:\n\nIf I have x =1 +3x', then x' =1 +3x'', and so on. So, each layer adds another term in the series. So, perhaps the total sum can be expressed as a geometric series with ratio 3.\n\nLet me try to see: The innermost term is 1 +3=4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 +3*previous. So, the sequence is 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524,88572.\n\nWait, but how does this relate to a geometric series? Let me see:\n\nEach term is 1 +3*previous term. So, each term is 1 +3*(previous term). So, if I denote the nth term as a_n, then a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is the same recurrence relation as before, leading to a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, the ninth term, a_9, is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression S, it's equal to 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) up to nine layers.\n\nWait, but if I think of S as the sum, then S =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with nine layers.\n\nBut actually, S is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the ninth layer.\n\nSo, perhaps the sum can be expressed as S=3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, S= (3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nThis is another way to express the result, using exponents.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize a recursive pattern where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of each layer as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))), it's a recursive structure. Maybe it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by a factor. In this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*previous. So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation might give me a formula to compute L_n without having to compute each layer manually. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 (correct). For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 (correct). For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 (correct). Okay, so this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).
