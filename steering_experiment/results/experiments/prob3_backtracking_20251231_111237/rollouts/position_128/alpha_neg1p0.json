Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To double-check, maybe compute a few layers using both methods to see if they match. For example, Layer 1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 Correct. Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 88572. So, yes, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence relation, we can efficiently compute each layer.

After computing up to the ninth layer, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Same result. So, that confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.

By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we determine the value at each step.
