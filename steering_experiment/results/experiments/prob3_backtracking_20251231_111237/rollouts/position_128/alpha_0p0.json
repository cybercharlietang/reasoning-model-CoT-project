By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Calculation:** Multiply the ninth layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think about how each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an added 1 each time. However, since the 1 is added at each step, it's a bit more complicated. But using the recurrence relation and solving it as I did above seems more straightforward. So, to recap, I computed each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and found that each layer's value is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. After computing up to the ninth layer, I multiplied by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the recurrence method confirmed the step-by-step computation.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. So, if I let S be the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))).

Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this until the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
