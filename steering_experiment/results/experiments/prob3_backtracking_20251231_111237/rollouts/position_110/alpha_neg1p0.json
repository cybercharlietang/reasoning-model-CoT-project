    "text": " Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract B from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence, and solving it as I did above. But since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step is feasible without needing a formula. However, recognizing the pattern can save time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for now, since it's manageable, computing each layer step by step is straightforward. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, all these steps seem correct. I don't see any arithmetic errors upon reviewing.

So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the earlier result.

The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses: each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is just 1+3, that's layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another. So, layer 1: 1+3, layer 2: 1+3*(layer1), ..., layer9:1+3*(layer8). So, yes, layer9 is the outermost one, which we compute as 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Alternatively, if I think about it as a geometric series, each term is multiplied by 3 each time, so the total would be a geometric series with ratio 3, but since it's nested, it's more of a geometric progression in the coefficients. But since I already have a closed-form solution, I think that's sufficient. So, to recap: 1. Start from the innermost parentheses, compute each layer step by step, each time substituting the previous layer's result into the next. 2. After computing up to layer9, which gives 29524, multiply by 3 to get the final result. 3. Alternatively, model the recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution, which confirms that layer9 is 29524, leading to the same final result.

Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Wait, just to make sure, I'll cross-verify with the step-by-step computation. Earlier, I computed each layer up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Now, using the formula, I got the same result, so that gives me more confidence. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3*4. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 9*4 = 1 + 3 + 12 = 16? Wait, no, that's not matching. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Wait, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the closed-form is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we found earlier. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, all methods point to the same answer. Therefore, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. Good. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as before. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1=4, which corresponds to n=1. Then each subsequent layer is n=2,3,...,9. So, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.

Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
