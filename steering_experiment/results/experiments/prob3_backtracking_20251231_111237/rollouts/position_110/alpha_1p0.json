    "text": " Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 =1 +3*a_1=1+12=13. Using the formula: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. Similarly, n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Which matches what I computed earlier. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my previous computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start without computing each layer. But since I was initially unsure, computing each layer step by step helped me verify the correctness. It's a good practice to cross-check using different methods to ensure that the answer is accurate.

Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we compute up to the ninth layer, which gives 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but in our problem, all a_n are integers. Maybe this approach is complicating things, or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is different. Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The standard form for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier, but since the number of layers isn't too large, computing each step was manageable. But it's good to know that there's a formula for such nested expressions. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, I arrived at the final answer of 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Let's use n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We know B = -1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, n=3: (81)/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Perfect, so the formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.

Maybe the homogeneous solution is correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in the particular solution. Alternatively, let's try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plug into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct, matches Layer 3. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, Layer k is (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2.

So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...).

When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

    "text": " Let's subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so 3^{9+1} = 3^10. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 3^11 = 177147 So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572. So, that matches the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

    "text": " Let's subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but our layers are integers. Maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence relation properly. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plug into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but I think the recurrence approach worked well here. Let me just verify the exponent in the general solution. Since the recurrence was a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from a_1 = 4. So, n=1: a_1=4=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, correct. n=2: a_2=13=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: a_3=40=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated as 1 + 3*(previous result). After computing all layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.
