So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication because I might have messed up the carries. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors in computation. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could have been applied here to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, it's similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. Wait, actually, each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for this. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, wait no, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw earlier. But in the problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) + 1. So, it's a linear recurrence of the form a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can use the method for solving linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3/2) - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches our earlier calculation. Good. So, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049/2) - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without going through each layer. That's a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. It's good to know both methods though: the step-by-step expansion and the closed-form formula. So, to wrap it up, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer. Finally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

So, writing it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again.

So, putting it together: 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4 (Layer1). Then Layer2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from Layer1 to Layer9. Wait, but let me check: when n=1, a1=4, which matches (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct. So, for Layer9, n=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I cross-checked both by computing each layer step by step and by finding the general formula for the recurrence relation, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and a recurrence relation approach, the final result is determined to be 88,572.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLet me go back and verify each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. So after computing the innermost Layer 1, each subsequent layer is built by 1 + 3*(previous layer). So Layer 9 is the result inside the outermost parentheses, and then we multiply that by 3. So yes, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous, which resembles a geometric series. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, eventually leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive sequence. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, L_{n} =1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n>1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving L_n -3 L_{n-1} =1. The homogeneous equation is L_n -3 L_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the equation: C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) =>4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which simplifies the computation. Multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Then, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me retrace the layers: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 to a_9, so n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to 9 layers. But since I've already solved it using the recurrence relation, and both methods agree, I think 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, and building up to Layer 9, then multiplying by 3. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572. Hmm, but I feel like the number is getting quite large, so maybe I should check each multiplication step. Let's go through each layer again, just to be sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. 363 +1=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. 1092 +1=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute this carefully. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be thorough. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of 1+3(...): There are 9 instances of 1+3(...). So, that means there are 9 layers. So, I computed up to Layer 9, then multiplied by 3. So, that seems correct. Therefore, I think the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 27. So, putting it together: 27 8 8 7 2. Wait, that seems off. Let me do it step by step. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit: 5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next digit: 9*3=27. So, writing it from right to left: 2 (from 4*3), 7 (from 2*3 +1), 5 (from 5*3 +1), 8 (from 9*3 +2), 8 (from 2*3 +2), and finally 27 from 9*3. Wait, that can't be right because we've already accounted for all digits. Wait, 29524 has 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4. So when we multiply by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\n= ?\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 8\n\nSo yes, the result is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Each term is defined by the previous one. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln.\n\nLooking at the recursion:\n\nLn = 1 + 3*Ln-1\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ln = Ln^h + Ln^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, we have:\n\nL9 = (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 *29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we get the same result, which confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach Layer n is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nBut actually, in this case, since each term is 1 + 3*(next term), it's more of a linear recurrence rather than a geometric series, but the formula we derived earlier is similar to the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, in our formula, Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, which is similar to the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n, which would be (3^(n+1) -1)/ (3 -1) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So yes, it's the sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, each layer is effectively the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n, but in our case, it's built recursively. Either way, the formula holds.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3 *29524 again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. Each digit multiplied by 3 gives the respective digits in the result, as I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer (Layer 9) equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each nested layer from the inside out:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 29,524 * 3 = 88,572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but wait, when I computed Layer 9, I had 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Is that correct? Let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of parentheses to make sure I have the right number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting after the first 3, each ( is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. ( after 3: Layer 1\n2. ( after that: Layer 2\n3. ( : Layer 3\n4. ( : Layer 4\n5. ( : Layer 5\n6. ( : Layer 6\n7. ( : Layer 7\n8. ( : Layer 8\n9. ( : Layer 9\n10. ( : Layer 10? Wait, no, because the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another (.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3(1+3(...)), so the innermost is the last (1+3). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Let me write it out:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer2)\nLayer 4: 1+3(Layer3)\nLayer 5: 1+3(Layer4)\nLayer 6: 1+3(Layer5)\nLayer 7: 1+3(Layer6)\nLayer 8: 1+3(Layer7)\nLayer 9: 1+3(Layer8)\nLayer 10: 1+3(Layer9)\nWait, but the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n... and so on, up to 9 layers because there are nine sets of (1+3(...)) after the initial 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is 3 times a 9-layered expression. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, I think I did 9 layers, which is correct. So, Layer9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my multiplication again because 29524 * 3. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let's break down 29524 into parts:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nNow, multiply each part by 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers, let me recompute each layer quickly.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final step is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss any layers or make any calculation errors. Each step seems logical, and the numbers add up correctly. So, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers.

Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n is following the pattern a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:**\n   \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. So the number is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572. Now, 87000 + 1000=88000, 88000 + 572=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this. The expression seems to be a repeated multiplication and addition, which might be similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, using the formula, we can compute directly without going through each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, step-by-step isn't too bad. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation provides a formula to compute the value of each layer efficiently. Applying this formula up to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost layer.\n\n2. **Compute each layer step-by-step**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 24 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I got Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me verify if I computed each layer correctly because that seems like a lot of layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572. So that should be the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is of the form Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), so:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, because 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11}, and 3*1=3, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3^{11} is 177147.\n\nSo, 177147 - 3 = 177144.\n\nThen, 177144 / 2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, using the formula, we can compute the final answer without computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, we can compute the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))), which can be broken down into layers where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Each layer follows the relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with the innermost layer a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n3. **General Solution**: Solving the recurrence relation, we find that each layer a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer**: The outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Let me verify the multiplication step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d73=1500\n\n20 \u00d73=60\n\n4 \u00d73=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So the multiplication is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check back through the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let's go step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nWait, actually, starting from a_1=4, then a_2=1 +3*4=13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc. So it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 \u21d2 C -3C =1 \u21d2 -2C=1 \u21d2 C= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A -1/2 =4 \u21d2 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2 A=(9/2)/3=3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, we can confirm that the value is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a base-3 expansion or something, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So 3^10 is 59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying 29524 by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step.

Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^{n} + d, where d is a particular solution. Let's find the particular solution. Assuming a steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = d. So, d = 1 + 3d => d - 3d = 1 => -2d =1 => d = -1/2. Hmm, that's a negative number, which doesn't make sense in the context of our problem because all our a_n are positive. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each term as I did before since n is small (only 9 layers). Alternatively, let me see if I can find a pattern in the a_n terms: a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. Let me see the ratio between consecutive terms: a2/a1=13/4=3.25, a3/a2=40/13\u22483.077, a4/a3\u2248121/40\u22483.025, a5/a4\u2248364/121\u22483.008, a6/a5\u22481093/364\u22483.000, and so on. It seems like each ratio is approaching 3 as n increases, which makes sense because the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, so as n becomes large, a_n \u2248 3a_{n-1}, hence the ratio approaches 3. But for n=9, it's not extremely large, so the ratios are slightly above 3. However, this doesn't directly help me find a closed-form, but perhaps I can express a_n in terms of a geometric series. Let me expand a few terms to see the pattern: a1=4=1+3=1+3^1\na2=1 + 3a1=1 + 3*(1 + 3)=1 + 3 + 9=1 + 3 + 3^2\na3=1 + 3a2=1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9)=1 + 3 + 9 + 27=1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3\nSimilarly, a4=1 + 3a3=1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27)=1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81=1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4\nWait a minute, so it seems that a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}\nBut let me check: For a1, n=1: 1 + 3=4, which matches.\na2=1 + 3 + 9=13, which matches.\na3=1 + 3 + 9 + 27=40, which matches.\nYes, so in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but wait, that's a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series is (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, so sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct.\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct.\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\nGreat, so the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, Layer 9 is a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern, we can see that each layer forms a geometric series. The innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4. Each subsequent layer adds another power of 3. The nth layer can be expressed as a geometric series sum, leading to the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition to find B. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nBut I need another equation to solve for A and B. Let me compute a_2 using the recurrence.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\nUsing the closed-form: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B =13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) =13 -4\n\n6A =9 => A= 9/6= 3/2=1.5\n\nNow plug A=1.5 into equation 1: 3*(1.5) + B=4 =>4.5 + B=4 => B=4 -4.5= -0.5\n\nSo, the closed-form is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 0.5= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So the digits are 7, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3 is 88572. Let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer1: 1+3=4. Layer2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition, when n=1, L_1 = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the final answer is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find the value of the innermost layer and use it to compute the next, continuing this process until the outermost layer is reached.

Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=1. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's a geometric progression. But in any case, both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572, correct. So, I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if there's a pattern or a formula that can give me L_n without computing each step. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572, which is the same as before. So, using the formula gives me the same result without having to compute each layer step by step. That was a good exercise. I think I've got it right. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer, n=9, we compute L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6, 2*3=6.

But wait, let me double-check each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Let's go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the layers check out. So, I think I did this correctly. It was a bit tedious, but by breaking it down step by step, I managed to compute each layer without making a mistake. I guess the key here was to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward, computing each layer one by one. That way, I didn't get overwhelmed by the complexity of the entire expression. It's like peeling an onion\u2014each layer reveals a simpler part until you reach the core. In this case, each layer is a simple multiplication and addition, which made the problem manageable. I was worried at first that I might make a mistake with all those threes and ones, but by being methodical, I avoided errors. I also had to remember to multiply the final result by 3 at the end, which was easy once I had the value of the innermost expression computed. So, in summary, the process was:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure.\n2. Start computing from the innermost parentheses.\n3. Move outward, computing each layer step by step.\n4. Multiply the final result by 3 as per the original expression.\n\nThis approach worked well for this problem. I don't think there's a formula or shortcut for this specific nested expression, but if there were, it might involve recognizing a geometric series or some recursive pattern. However, since the nesting isn't too deep (only nine layers), computing each step manually was feasible. If the expression were longer, say with 20 layers, I might consider looking for a pattern or a formula to compute it more efficiently. But for nine layers, step-by-step computation was manageable. I also considered whether there might be a mistake in my multiplication when I got to the final step, so I double-checked each layer's computation. It's always good to verify, especially when dealing with repetitive steps where it's easy to make a small error. Overall, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer to this problem.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Compute the innermost expression:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Work outward, computing each subsequent layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the final result by 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number. Maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9. It seems like a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term. Let's consider the recurrence relation: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So, when n=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^(2))/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches L1. Similarly, n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches L2. Good, so the formula seems correct. Therefore, Layer n is Ln = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L9 = (3^(10))/2 - 1/2. Wait, but in our earlier calculation, Layer 9 was 29524. Let me compute (3^10)/2 - 1/2: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049/2 = 29524.5, minus 0.5 is 29524. Perfect, that matches. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^10)/2 - 1/2 ) = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, all steps seem correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Looking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as I computed before, a\u2089 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a\u2099. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can use the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a\u2099 - 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3\u00b9 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a\u2081 = (3\u00b2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a\u2082 = (3\u00b3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a\u2083 = (3\u2074 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40.

Correct.\n\nn=6: a\u2086 = (3\u2077 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a\u2087 = (3\u2078 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a\u2088 = (3\u2079 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula works. Therefore, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*(3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2 = (3\u00b9\u00b9 - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3\u00b9\u00b9 is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144, then divided by 2 is 88572. So, that confirms the result I got earlier.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression using another approach, perhaps by expanding it step by step without using the formula. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with all previous methods. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked each step and even derived a formula to confirm the result. It seems that the answer is indeed 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident about this solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Yes, that's correct. So, putting it all together, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.

So, yes, each step seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a recursive sequence.

This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth term is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my previous result. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Recognizing this pattern allows us to derive a general formula for the nth term of the sequence, which simplifies the computation. Using this formula, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to obtain the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Recognizing the pattern, the nth term is given by a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Final Computation**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So that's the final answer.\n\nBut let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, each layer seems to compute correctly, and the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or formula that could have allowed me to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. However, if the number of layers were larger, perhaps a recursive formula or a geometric series approach could be used.\n\nWait a minute, let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the coefficients are constant, we can solve it iteratively as I did, or find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form expression confirmed the result. This might have been a quicker way if I had recognized the pattern earlier, but since I was able to compute each layer step by step without error, it worked out.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is effectively building a geometric series. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to the expansion of (3 + 1)^n, but it's not exactly the same because each term is nested rather than summed.\n\nBut in this case, the recurrence approach worked well. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern can lead to a formula that simplifies the computation, especially if the number of layers were larger. For example, if there were 20 layers, calculating each step manually would be tedious, but using the formula would be straightforward.\n\nIn summary, by either iteratively computing each layer or by finding the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form expression, which confirms the result when computed step by step.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me verify with another method. 30000 *3=90000, so 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476*3)=90000 -1428=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Layer 9 was 29524, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing them.

So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but the original problem is 3*(...), so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the layers.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost: 1+3=4\n\nThen each layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because the innermost is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, 9 layers in total. So, Layer 9 is the outermost, which is 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct, right? Let me verify each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. So, that's the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1=1+3=4\n\na_2=1+3*a_1=1+12=13\n\na_3=1+3*a_2=1+39=40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n=1+3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nThe general solution is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve for C and D.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume the solution is a_n = C*3^n + D.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 + D = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, we can express the final answer as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So the number is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them step by step: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think that's correct, but just to make sure, maybe I should check my calculations for each layer again quickly. Let me recount each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, everything seems to add up correctly.

So, I think I did this correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach to verify. Perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirms the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula, which confirms the result when applied to the innermost value. Multiplying the final layer by 3 yields the answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, actually, let me count the digits properly:\n\n29524 is five digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\n\nSo, writing it all together, we get 88572.

Wait, no, that's not right because 29524 \u00d7 3 should be 88572? Let me check with another method. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just go through my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524 Then, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3\u00d7previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3\u00d7a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3\u00d7a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3\u00d7a_1 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13, which matches what I had before. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3\u00d7a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence relation, we can look for a pattern or use the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C\u00d73^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3\u00d7K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C\u00d73^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C\u00d73^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which also matches. Great, so the formula works. Now, since our layers go from a_1 up to a_9, we can compute a_9 using this formula. a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3\u00d7a_9 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572, as before. Therefore, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same result. I think that solidifies the answer. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).
