So, putting it all together: 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Alternatively, 29524 *3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So the number is 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. So, 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my computations because sometimes when I do multiple layers, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4. Then, a_{n}=1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, let's see: Wait, actually, in our earlier computation, we had Layer 1: n=1, a_1=4=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. Layer 2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward, computing each layer. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3. Using the recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\(a_n\\) can be expressed as \\((3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\). For the ninth layer, this gives us 29,524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer computation step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series, perhaps? Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the answer is 88572. Therefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost outward.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a formula. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, the solution can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, is that right? Let me check for n=1: a_1 = 4. If I plug into the formula: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, which is not 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe the formula is different. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. Perfect, so the formula works. So, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: n=1, a_1=4. The outermost layer is Layer 9, which corresponds to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That matches our earlier computation for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms our previous result. Alternatively, we could have used the formula from the start, recognizing the pattern and applying the formula directly. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step and verify it with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with a repeating pattern.

So multiplying each digit by 3: 2 * 3 = 6 (ten thousands place) 9 * 3 = 27 (thousands place: 7, carry over 2) 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 (hundreds place: 7, carry over 1) 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 (tens place) 4 * 3 = 12 (units place: 2, carry over 1, but since there are no more digits, we add it as 1 in the next place). Wait, actually, I think I messed up the places. Let me try a different approach. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a lot, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me verify each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in computing the layers. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but nested. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2: a_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we can set up a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a sum of a geometric series, but since it's nested, it's a bit different. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3, but each term is added to 1. So, the closed-form formula we derived earlier is the way to go. I think I've verified it sufficiently, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

After the thousands place, which was 9 * 3 + 1 = 28, so we wrote 8 and carried over 2. Then, the next digit is 2 (ten-thousands place) * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8. So we write 8, and there's no more digits, but we have a carryover of 0 now. So the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, everything checks out. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without labeling the layers, just to see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. I think I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let's see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form solution also leads me to the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer follows a geometric progression might have allowed me to compute it more quickly, but since I was able to compute it step by step and verify with the recurrence relation, I feel confident in the result.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, as both methods led to the same answer. So, I'm ready to conclude that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let's compute digit by digit. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 is 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27, plus carryover 1 is 28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 2 is 8. 9 * 3 = 27, but wait, let's make sure of the digits. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28.

Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent each time I check. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, maybe using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a first-order linear recurrence, and its solution can be expressed as a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nTo find D, we can solve for the steady-state value, which is when a_n = a_{n-1} = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that formula. Let's test it for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f. Okay, that seems correct. So, the nth term is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that approach as well.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I expand each layer, I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 3^2 + 3^1.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13, which is 1 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0? Wait, 1 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 14, which is not 13. Hmm, maybe that approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each layer adds another term in the geometric series. Let me see.\n\nWait, layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 3^0 + 3^1? Wait, 9 + 3 + 1 = 13. Yes, that's correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^1 + 3^0? Wait, 27 + 3 + 1 = 31, which is not 40. Hmm, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: Let's see, when I compute layer 2, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. So, it's 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nSimilarly, layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. But 39 is 3*(13) = 3*(3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2) = 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, layer 3 is 1 + (3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is correct. So, each layer adds another term in the geometric series.\n\nSo, layer n would be the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, but wait, let me see:\n\nWait, layer 1: sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nLayer 2: sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nLayer 3: sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nSo, each layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly the formula I derived earlier. So, layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is a sum of a geometric series, the entire expression can be represented as 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k). Wait, no, because each layer is a sum up to that point, so the outermost layer is sum up to 9, so the expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k). But let me compute that:\n\nSum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)), with nine layers. So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to building a geometric series.\n\nAnother approach: Let me represent the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine 3s. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for E.\n\nBut since I've already solved it using the step-by-step approach and verified it with the geometric series formula, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors, let me compute 3 * 29524 again. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method, like breaking it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 3*20000 = 60000\n3*9000 = 27000\n3*500 = 1500\n3*20 = 60\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that confirms it again.\n\nI think I've checked it enough times, and each time I arrive at the same answer. So, I'm pretty confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the outermost layer sums to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because if I made a mistake in any of the layers, the final answer would be off. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let me compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, let's subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the ninth layer, which equals 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer of 88572.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, that should be the final answer.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nI can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n, which might save time instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\nL_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence relation into this general solution.\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nSubstitute the assumed solution:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. Let's take n=1:\n\nL_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2\n\nSo,\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3A\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works.\n\nSo, for layer 9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute 3*29524.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the standard multiplication:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the computed value is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using a recurrence relation formula, we confirm that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The first digit is 2 * 3 = 6. Wait, actually, I think I messed up the place values. Let me write it out:\n\n      29524\n    x     3\n    --------\n      ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculation again because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Hmm, let's verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me go back and check if I computed each layer correctly because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count the number of 3(1+... parts. Starting from the left, after the first 3, there are nine instances of 3(1+... So, that would mean there are nine layers. So, yes, Layer 1 to Layer 9, which I computed correctly.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this problem is to recognize that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if we denote a_n as the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive formula, and we can solve it to find a general term, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can observe that this is a geometric series in disguise. Let me think about that. The recursive formula a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be expanded as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2})\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\nContinuing this way, we get:\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0\n\nBut wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. Hmm, but that doesn't immediately look like a geometric series. Alternatively, perhaps each a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test that.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct, a1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, a2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, a3=40.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct, a4=121.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct, a5=364.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct, a6=1093.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct, a7=3280.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct, a8=9841.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct, a9=29524.\n\nSo, yes, the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify the multiplication again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method, 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Maybe I miscalculated one of the layers.\n\nLet me go back:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 29,524 is correct for Layer 9, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but since each term is nested, it's more like a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this with a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the terms go as a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., which matches what I calculated earlier. So, each layer is a term in this sequence.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's homogeneous. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. So, this formula works.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses is a layer. The original expression is 3*(...), so the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1), up to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8). So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). Therefore, Layer9 is a_9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute a_9: (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer9.

Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Hmm, but I feel like that's a big number. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, because this seems tedious and error-prone.\n\nI remember that expressions like this, where each term is defined recursively, can sometimes be expressed using a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might save time.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. I think the solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution, a constant solution since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1). Let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Good, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that 3*a_9 is indeed the case. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost expression is a_1 = 4, so each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and the outermost layer is a_9, which is then multiplied by 3. So yes, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nHmm, seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is the original expression 3*(a_9)? Let me parse the expression again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then 1+3*(that), and so on, nine times, and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3. So yes, that's 3*a_9.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nYep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation, and then computing the final multiplication, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap the steps:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. For each layer, compute the value by substituting the inner value.\n\n3. After computing all nine layers, multiply the outermost value by 3.\n\n4. Alternatively, use the recurrence relation to find a formula for the nth layer, which simplifies the computation.\n\n5. Verify each step to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with large numbers.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. It also emphasized the importance of careful step-by-step computation to avoid errors, especially with multiple layers of operations.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the inner value, leading to a step-by-step solution. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a pattern, allowing us to compute the final result efficiently.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested set of terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) another similar expression.

So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, that seems off. Let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me recount each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I think I might have miscounted the layers because the original expression has 9 layers. Let me count the number of layers again. Starting from the innermost: Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each time we add another layer, so 1+3*(layer1) is layer2, up to layer9. So, my earlier computation of 9 layers is correct, leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Then, the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated as 1 plus three times the previous layer, leading up to the ninth layer being 29,524.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nAfter 3(, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so that's 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), that's Layer1, then each preceding one adds a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted.

So, I think my earlier steps are correct, and the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or something similar, but given that it's only 9 layers deep, computing each layer step by step is manageable.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Suppose I have an expression of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1 to 9, we compute a_9, and then multiply by 3. So, let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as we computed earlier.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer, we find the value at each step, leading to the final computation of the outermost layer multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression has nine layers of nested parentheses, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).\n2. **Compute from the innermost layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me retrace my steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is indeed 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the formula, let me verify with another term. For example, n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 =243-1=242/2=121. Which matches a_4=121. Good. So, the formula is correct. Therefore, using the formula, a_9=29524, and 3*a_9=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations or the reasoning. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, I think I did that correctly.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe there's a geometric series or something that can be applied here. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then we can write a recurrence relation.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, right? Because each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, comparing to the standard form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, we have k=3 and c=1.\n\nThe solution to this recurrence is a_n = 3^n * a0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) * c, where a0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is a9, n=9: a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^10 is 59049, so a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8, carryover 0.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, when I multiply by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carryover 0.\n\nBut there are no more digits beyond the 2, so the carryover 0 is done.\n\nSo, the result is 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, ultimately leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually because if I have to compute nine layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nWait, these numbers seem familiar. Let me see if they follow a particular sequence. Let me compute the ratio between each layer and the previous one:\n\nLayer 2 / Layer 1: 13 / 4 = 3.25\n\nLayer 3 / Layer 2: 40 /13 \u2248 3.077\n\nLayer 4 / Layer 3: 121 /40 = 3.025\n\nLayer 5 / Layer 4: 364 /121 \u2248 3.008\n\nLayer 6 / Layer 5: 1093 /364 \u2248 3.000\n\nLayer 7 / Layer 6: 3280 /1093 \u2248 3.000\n\nLayer 8 / Layer 7: 9841 /3280 \u2248 3.000\n\nLayer 9 / Layer 8: 29524 /9841 \u2248 3.000\n\nSo, each layer is approximately 3 times the previous one, but the earlier layers have a slight variation. That makes sense because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general form for each layer seems to be:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1)\n\nWith Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it using the method for such recursions. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has a solution of L(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\n=> 0 = 1 + 2A\n\n=> A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nL(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L(1)=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nWait, let's check this formula with n=1:\n\nL(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nL(4) = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 = (3^10 -1)/2, then 3 * Layer 9 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\n3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, no, actually, the number is 29524, which is five digits. So, when we multiply, the result should be:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8.\n\nSo the digits are 8 (from the ten-thousands place), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would make it 88572. But let me check with another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nAdding 29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 write down 0, carry over 1.\n\n9 + 9 + 1 = 19 \u2192 write down 9, carry over 1.\n\n2 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo that's 59048.\n\nNow, add another 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 +1=7.\n\n0 +5=5.\n\n9 +9=18 \u2192 8, carry 1.\n\n5 +2 +1=8.\n\nSo that gives 88572.

Let me make sure that was correct.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when I'm doing multiple layers, I might have made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.

Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without layers to confirm.\n\nLet me write the expression again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen moving out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 +12=13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(13)=1+39=40.\n\nNext:1 +3*(40)=1+120=121.\n\nNext:1 +3*(121)=1+363=364.\n\nNext:1 +3*(364)=1+1092=1093.\n\nNext:1 +3*(1093)=1+3279=3280.\n\nNext:1 +3*(3280)=1+9840=9841.\n\nNext:1 +3*(9841)=1+29523=29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach, perhaps using a formula for a geometric series or something similar, since each layer is a multiple of 3 added to 1. Wait, but in this case, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute it without calculating each layer step by step.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence relation: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p =1 => -2*a_p =1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 =4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4.\n\nSo 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but let's check this formula with our earlier calculations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the value after 9 layers is a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it multiple ways now: step by step calculation, using a recurrence relation formula, and checking each layer. All methods lead to the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the result of the inner layer into the outer one. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer's result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3**:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's break it down digit by digit. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it as 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, let's count the number of 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n... and so on, up to nine layers.\n\nWait, in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9, which was 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me write out the expression step by step:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer 1) (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer 2) (Layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*(Layer 3) (Layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*(Layer 4) (Layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*(Layer 5) (Layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*(Layer 6) (Layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*(Layer 7) (Layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*(Layer 8) (Layer 9)\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers, each one wrapping the previous. Therefore, my earlier calculation of 9 layers seems correct. So, computing each layer step by step, I got Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did each layer correctly. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9841*3.\n\nLet me compute 9841 \u00d7 3:\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n800 \u00d7 3 = 2400\n\n40 \u00d7 3 = 120\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523, and then adding 1 gives 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7   3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 to ensure I have the correct number of layers.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer.\n\nStarting after the first 3, the expression is:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses is 9, each corresponding to a layer. So, 9 layers in total. So, my earlier calculation of 9 layers is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this problem is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nBut since we have a specific number of terms (n=9), maybe it's easier to compute each term step by step as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, the closed-form solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. Let's see.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another term. There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression instead of computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a formula. In this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nGiven that, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's consider the general form of such a recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check if this works for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the problem, the outermost layer is 3*(...), so yes, it's 3 times a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be computed as 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, and the formula approach confirms it. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, I think I messed up the digit positions. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit starting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carry 0\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carry 0\n\nWait, that seems too long. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n3 \u00d7 9 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\n3 \u00d7 9 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 7, carry 1\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n3 \u00d7 9 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carry 0\nNow, since there are no more digits, the carry is 0.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 5 digits, so the result should be 88572. Let me check:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12, so 2 with carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\nNext: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, so 5 with carryover 1.\nNext: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8 with carryover 2.\nNext: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\nNo more digits, so the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did it earlier, I thought it was 88572, but I'm not sure. Let me add 29524 + 29524 + 29524 to check.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back to the layers. Did I compute each layer correctly?\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recompute them step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers are correct. So multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, does the original expression have nine layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts.\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 1+3(...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost is 1+3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the first 3, there are nine sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\n- The first layer is 3(1+3(...))\n- Inside that, another (1+3(...))\n- Repeating until the innermost.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach (1+3(...) starts a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer.\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is Layer 1.\n\nThen inside that, another (1+3(...)), which is Layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, Layer 1 was 1+3, which is the innermost. So, maybe I labeled them from innermost to outermost, but the actual layers in the expression are from outer to inner.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused with the labeling. Let me clarify.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outside, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times something). That something is another 1 + 3 times another something, and so on, until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). The innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because each (1 + 3(...) is a layer, starting from the first 3, and going in.\n\nTherefore, when I computed Layer 1 as 1 + 3, that's the innermost. Then Layer 2 is the next one out, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost (1 + 3*(Layer 8)), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, yes, my earlier computation is correct, with Layer 9 being 29524, and the final answer being 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since the number of layers is small (nine), computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to recognize the pattern as a recurrence relation. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, and f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to f(9). Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9). So, using this recurrence relation, I can compute f(n) up to n=9.\n\nLet me compute f(n) for n=1 to 9:\n\nf(1) = 4\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, same results. Then, 3*f(9) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could solve the recurrence relation formulaically. The recurrence is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its closed-form can be found. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find C, set f(n) = C, then C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition f(1)=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, f(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's compute digit by digit. Starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try another approach: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Okay, so that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computation of Layer 9 because that's crucial. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me just confirm that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...). Starting from the innermost: Each time I see 1 + 3(...), so let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1 + 3. Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me parse the expression again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let's see how many times that happens. Let me write it as layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my initial computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I just thought of another way to compute this. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, this recurrence relation can be modeled as a geometric series. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over = 7, write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over = 7, write down 7.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over = 8, write down 8.\nSo putting it all together, we get 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. It's easy to get lost in all those layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication, let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 another way.\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet's denote the layers as follows:\n\nLet a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution for such a recurrence is given by:\n\na_n = (c)/(1 - r) + (a_1 - (c)/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1}\n\nWait, but let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is:\n\na_n = r^{n-1}*(a_1 - c/(1 - r)) + c/(1 - r)\n\nBut in our case, r = 3 and c = 1.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c.\n\nIn our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so yes, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + (c*(r^{n} - 1))/(r - 1)\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. So perhaps I need to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, let's define a_0 as the starting point. If we set a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nSo, using the formula for a_n where a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, with a_0 = 1, r=3, c=1.\n\nThe general solution is a_n = (c/(r - 1))*(r^{n} - 1) + a_0*r^{n}\n\nWait, let me plug in the values:\n\na_n = (1/(3 - 1))*(3^{n} - 1) + 1*3^{n} = (1/2)*(3^{n} - 1) + 3^{n} = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + 3^{n} = (3^{n} - 1 + 2*3^{n}) / 2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used the recurrence relation approach, and even derived a formula to compute the nth term directly. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's solve it. First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K -3K =1 \u21d2 -2K=1 \u21d2 K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C -1/2 \u21d2 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's break it down digit by digit. 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So, 3 * 2 = 6 (ten thousands place) 3 * 9 = 27 (thousands place, carry over 2) 3 * 5 = 15 + 2 (carried over) = 17 (hundreds place, carry over 1) 3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 (tens place) 3 * 4 = 12 (units place) So writing it out: 6 (from 2*3), then 27, which is 7 in thousands place with a carryover of 2.

So putting it all together: 6 (ten thousands), 27 becomes 7 with a carryover, so 7 in thousands, then 7 in hundreds, 7 in tens, and 12 in units. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 0*3=0 +0=0, but since there's nothing before the 2, it's just 8.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because this seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.

Maybe I can compute it differently:\n\n29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nAdding these together: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, and then adding 1 again, and so on. It seems like a geometric series, but it's structured as a nested expression. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me consider that.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers:\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to compute it without using the formula, I could have noticed the pattern and applied it step by step as I did before. Either way, I arrive at the same result.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each layer again using the formula to cross-verify.\n\nn=1: (3^{2}-1)/2= (9-1)/2=4.\n\nn=2: (27-1)/2=13.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=40.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=121.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=364.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=1093.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=3280.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=9841.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=29524.\n\nYes, all match. So, I'm confident that the computation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer until we reach the outermost one, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost Layer):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, the final answer is 87572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought each layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me make sure that I didn't skip any layers or miscount them. The original expression has 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" in the original problem.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n... Up to 9 layers.\n\nWait, actually, the original problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...), so there are 9 instances of 1+3(...). So, that would correspond to 9 layers, which I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=87572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1+3(...)). Each time I see a \"(\", it's a new layer. Let me count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...))\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, each corresponding to the innermost to outermost. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost before the initial 3. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct, and then the entire expression is 3*Layer9, which is 87572.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=87572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 87572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to be certain.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=87572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 87572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{87572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 87572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{87572}\n\\]"

Yes, that matches.

So, I think I did it correctly. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and by computing from the inside out, I avoided getting lost in the nested parentheses. It's a bit tedious, but methodical. I guess another way to look at it is that each layer is following the pattern of 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is a geometric progression or something similar. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, computing each one step by step is manageable. If it were a larger number of layers, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could be generalized, but for this problem, nine layers are manageable manually. So, after computing each layer, I arrived at the final result of 88572.

Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524, so multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. So the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recurrence relation. Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for Ln. The recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. Let's try to solve this recurrence. First, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Ln^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = Ln^h + Ln^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. So, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, because 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I got earlier. So, L9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see: Each term is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)). So, perhaps the entire expression is a geometric series with ratio 3, but I think the recurrence approach was more straightforward in this case. Anyway, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. Layer 2: $1 + 3(4) = 13$\n3. Layer 3: $1 + 3(13) = 40$\n4. Layer 4: $1 + 3(40) = 121$\n5. Layer 5: $1 + 3(121) = 364$\n6. Layer 6: $1 + 3(364) = 1093$\n7. Layer 7: $1 + 3(1093) = 3280$\n8. Layer 8: $1 + 3(3280) = 9841$\n9. Layer 9: $1 + 3(9841) = 29524$\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me write it out:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n?\n\nCompute from right to left:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8, no carry.\n\nSo reading the digits from top to bottom: 87572.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 87572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this multiplication because 3*29524 is 88572, I think. Wait, no, 29524*3: Let me compute it more carefully.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 87572. Hmm, but I feel like that's not correct because 29524*3: 29524 is approximately 29,524. So 30,000*3 is 90,000, so 29,524*3 should be just a bit less, like 88,572. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit step by step:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7, no carry.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7, no carry.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nFinally, the leftmost digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together, starting from the right, the digits are 2, 7, 5, 7, 7, 8. Wait, that can't be right because we started with 29524, which is a 5-digit number, so the result should be 5 or 6 digits. Wait, no, 29524 is 5 digits, 3 is 1 digit, so the product should be 5 or 6 digits. Let me write it correctly:\n\nThe digits from right to left are:\n\n- Units place: 2\n- Tens place: 7\n- Hundreds place: 5\n- Thousands place: 7\n- Ten-thousands place: 8\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2 (from the carryover?)\n\nWait, no, when I computed 9*3=27, I wrote down 7 and carried over 2. Then, 2*3=6 + 2=8, so that's the next digit. So the number is 87572. Wait, but 29524*3: Let me check using another method. 29524*3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4)*3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Oh! I see where I messed up earlier. I think I misplaced the digits when writing them down. So the correct result is 88572, not 87572. So my initial digit-by-digit computation was wrong because I didn't account for the carryover properly. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, when I compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n\n9*3=27. Write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo the digits are, from right to left: 2,7,5,7,7,8. Wait, that's six digits. But when I broke it down, I got 88572, which is five digits. Wait, no, 88572 is five digits: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So perhaps I miscounted the digits earlier.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAfter multiplying each digit:\n\n- Units place: 2\n- Tens place: 7\n- Hundreds place: 5\n- Thousands place: 7\n- Ten-thousands place: 8\n- Hundred-thousands place: 0 (since 2*3 + carryover 2 is 8, which is the fifth digit from the right).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me write the multiplication properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x        3\n   ------------\n     8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, that would be:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo writing it from top to bottom: 8 (from the 2*3+2), then 8 (from 9*3+1=28, write 8, carryover 2), then 5 (from 5*3=15), then 7 (from 2*3=6), then 2 (from 4*3=12). So the number is 88572. So that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that because I initially thought it was 87572, which was wrong, but now I'm getting 88572, which seems correct based on the digit-by-digit multiplication.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer's value is used in the computation of the next. After calculating each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer's value by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so compute 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let's multiply 29524 by 3 digit by digit. Starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carryover 1 is 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus carryover 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 2 is 8. Next digit: 9 (the ten-thousands place) * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. Finally, the leftmost digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 2 is 8. Wait, that seems a bit off.

Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).

Let's compute that:\n\n59048\n+29524\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n0 + 5 = 5\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572.
