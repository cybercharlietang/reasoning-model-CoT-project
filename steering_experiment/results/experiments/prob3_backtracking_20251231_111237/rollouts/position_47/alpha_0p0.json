So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, no, L_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Now, to solve this recurrence relation, I can try to find a closed-form formula. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous plus particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. Wait, actually, L_1 = 4, which is when n=1. So, plugging n=1 into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirmed the result from the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if that's the case. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging in the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. But L_n is also equal to A*3^n + B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fraction, which is a bit unexpected since all our layers so far have been integers. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants. Let me try that. Then, plugging into the recurrence: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. So, we have: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. Subtract C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers we've computed. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, but wait, did I count the layers correctly? Let me check again. The original expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost, I did 9 layers. Let me recount: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Yeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric sequence or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39=40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants. Let's plug it into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} So, C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D Now, set equal to left side: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D Subtract C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D Subtract D from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2D => 2D = -1 => D = -1/2 So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the closed-form formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the closed-form expression. This might have saved time instead of computing each layer, especially if the number of layers was larger. But for 9 layers, it's manageable either way. So, just to recap: The problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus three times the next layer. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, I found a closed-form solution which allowed me to compute the value without manually calculating each layer. This approach is more efficient and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors, especially with more layers.

Let me verify with another method. 29,524 \u00d7 3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048; 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. I think I did each step right. So the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3.

Next: 9*3=27, write 27. So putting it all together: 27852. Wait, that seems too low because 29524 is almost 30,000, so 3*30,000 is 90,000. So 27,852 is way too low. I must have messed up the multiplication. Let me try again. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, no carryover.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 27.\n\nWait, so starting from the right:\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n- Hundred-thousands place:9*3=27, write 27.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when we multiply by 3, the result should be 6 digits. Let me write it as:\n\n29524\n*    3\n------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n9*3=27, write 27.\n\nSo writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8,7,2? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, let's do it properly:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 (units place) * 3 = 12. So we write 2 and carryover 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried over 1 is 7. Write 7.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 * 3 = 27, plus carried over 1 is 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit (ten-thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6, plus carried over 2 is 8. Write 8.\n\nNext digit (hundred-thousands place): 9 * 3 = 27. Write 27.\n\nSo putting it all together, from the hundred-thousands place down:\n\n27 (from 9*3) followed by 8 (from 2*3 +2), then 8 (from 9*3 +1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3 +1), then 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that doesn't make sense because we're writing from right to left, so the first digit we write is units, then tens, etc. So the result should be 27852? But that can't be right because 29524 is almost 30,000, so 3 times that is almost 90,000. So 27,852 is way too small. I must have made a mistake in the order.\n\nWait, no, actually, when we do multiplication, we start from the right and write each digit to the left. So the first digit is units, then tens, then hundreds, etc. So let me write it correctly:\n\n29524\n*    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12: write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7: write 7, carryover 0.\n5*3=15: write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28: write 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8: write 8.\n9*3=27: write 27.\n\nSo the result is 27852? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, I think I missed a step. Let me write it out step by step:\n\nMultiply each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 27.\n\nWait, but the number is 29524, which is 2 9 5 2 4. So when multiplying, the digits are 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when we multiply each digit by 3, starting from units:\n\n4*3=12: write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7: write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15: write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28: write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8: write 8.\n\n9*3=27: write 27.\n\nWait, but the 9 is in the thousands place, so after the 2*3=8, we have the 9*3=27. But wait, the number is 29524, so the digits are 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when we multiply, we go from units to ten-thousands.\n\nSo the multiplication should be:\n\n4*3=12: units place is 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7: tens place is 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15: hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28: thousands place is 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8: ten-thousands place is 8.\n\n9*3=27: hundred-thousands place is 27.\n\nWait, but the original number is 29524, which is a 5-digit number, so the result should be a 6-digit number starting with 27.\n\nSo writing it out: 27852? Wait, that can't be because 29524 *3 should be 88572.\n\nWait, let me check with another method. Let's compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 *3 = 60000\n\n9000 *3 = 27000\n\n500 *3 = 1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, so 29524 *3=88572.\n\nSo my earlier calculation was wrong because I was misplacing the digits. So the correct multiplication gives 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So that's the final answer.\n\nBut let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is computed correctly, so Layer9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the layers again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make an addition mistake.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers are correct. So the final computation is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=4, and a_{n}=1+3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I used both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and both gave me the same result. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated 9 times, resulting in Layer 9 being 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's better to do it step by step. 29524 * 3: Let's multiply each digit: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.

Maybe I should just do 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6+1=7, 7. 5*3=15, 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27+1=28, 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6+2=8, 8. 9*3=27, 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15+2=17, 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6+1=7, 7. 9*3=27, 7, carryover 2. 4*3=12+2=14, 4, carryover 1. 2*3=6+1=7, 7. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me check again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Now, since there are no more digits, the carryover 2 would go to the next higher digit, making it 2. So putting it all together: 2 (from carryover), 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88,572? Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27+1=28, 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So the result is 88,572. Wait, but 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final answer would be 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. When n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, using the formula, I also get 88,572. That confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find each layer's value. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a general formula for the nth layer. Applying this formula for n=9 gives the value of the innermost expression, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times.

For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524.\n\n4. **Compute the Final Result:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7, write 7.\n- 5 *3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, that's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet's compute 59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 =12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n4 + 2 =6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n0 +5=5.\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carryover 1.\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8.\n\nWait, but 59048 + 29524:\n\nLet me write it down:\n\n  59048\n\n+29524\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 +4=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n4 +2=6 +1=7.\n\n0 +5=5.\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carryover 1.\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8.\n\nSo, adding those together: 88572. Yep, same result. So, 29524 *3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, which would throw off the entire calculation.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are 9 layers, perhaps there's a way to express this recursively or using a geometric series.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1=1+3=4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, for n>1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + C = 3*(a_{n-1} + C). Let me set a_n + C = 3*(a_{n-1} + C). Then, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 2C. Comparing to the original equation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, we have 2C=1 => C=1/2.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is a_n + 1/2 = 3^n*(a_1 +1/2). Wait, let me think again.\n\nActually, the recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nHomogeneous equation: a_n -3a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I considered both the step-by-step computation and the recursive formula approach, and both led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that. After computing all nine layers, we find the value of the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check: 30000 * 3 = 90000, and 476 * 3 = 1428, so 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Hmm, but wait, 29524 is less than 30000, so 30000 - 476 is 29524. So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572.

Wait, this seems like I'm going too far. Maybe I should just multiply digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, no, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo writing it out:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\u00d7        3\n----------\n2 7 8 5 2\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be more than 80,000, right? Wait, no, 29524 is about 30,000, so 30,000 *3=90,000, so 29524*3 should be 88,572.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nLet me write it properly:\n\n          2 9 5 2 4\n        \u00d7      3\n        -----------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 87,572?

So the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a different approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Maybe I made an error in computing one of the layers earlier. Let me go back and check each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2192 correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again using another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3.\n\n20000*3=60,000\n\n9000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's it. I've gone through each layer carefully, making sure each step is correct, and then verified the final multiplication. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I made a mistake in the multiplication steps. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Let's add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By solving each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the 9th layer, \\(L_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8, carry 0.\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering the number of layers, it might be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could simplify this computation instead of calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1.\n\nBut L_n is also equal to A*3^n + B, so:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtracting A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier layers:\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9, but wait, no, because each layer is multiplied by 3. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But that's similar to E = 3 + 9*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). Wait, that seems recursive. Alternatively, maybe I can express E in terms of itself. Let me try that.\n\nLet E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. But actually, since there are nine layers, it's not infinitely recursive, so maybe that approach isn't directly applicable. Alternatively, since each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and we have n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before. Then E = 3*L_9 = 88572. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a closed-form solution. Calculating each layer step-by-step or using the formula confirms the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. This forms a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let \\( L_n \\) represent the nth layer. The relation is:\n   \\[\n   L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with the innermost layer \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Find the Closed-Form Solution:**\n   The recurrence relation can be solved to find:\n   \\[\n   L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer:**\n   The expression has 9 layers, so compute \\( L_9 \\):\n   \\[\n   L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times \\( L_9 \\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me verify:\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\nSo, the result is 88,572. Wait, but 29,524 \u00d7 3: Let's check with another method. 29,524 \u00d7 3: 20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000; 9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000; 500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500; 20 \u00d7 3 = 60; 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. So adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if Layer 9 is 29,524, then 3 times that is 88,572. But let me go back through each layer to check for errors because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, but actually, 3*364 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 is 1,093. So that's correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 90*3=270; 3*3=9. So 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 +9=3,279. Then 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840. So 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000; 841*3=2,523. So 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them again:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the opening parentheses:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n... and so on, up to nine layers. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost, which we computed as 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 88,572. So, I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made an arithmetic error somewhere.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me write out the terms:\n\nLayer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\nLayer 7: a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\nLayer 8: a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\nLayer 9: a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, using the formula confirms that the answer is correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined recursively. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). Using this recursive formula, we compute each layer step by step until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the recursive pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)} \\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1,093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1,093 = 3,280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3,280 = 9,841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9,841 = 29,524 \\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572 \\)\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, all the layers seem correct, and the multiplication at the end is correct as well. Therefore, I think 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, starting with 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer wraps around the previous result multiplied by 3 and adds 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, let's compute each digit multiplied by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nSo putting it together: 8 7 5 7 2, but wait, that's 87572? Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, no, when you write down from right to left, it's 2, then 7, then 5, then 8, then 8. So the number is 87572. Wait, let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 87572. Let me verify with another method: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3: Let's compute it properly.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nAh, so the correct result is 88572. So I must have messed up the digit-by-digit calculation earlier. Let me try that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nSo the digits are 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, but that's 88572, which matches the other method. Wait, no, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So when multiplying by 3, starting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2*3=6+1=7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n5*3=15 \u21925, carry 1\n9*3=27+1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n2*3=6+2=8 \u21928\n\nSo writing from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8 \u2192 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach \"1+3\" is a Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 \u2192 Layer 1\nThen 1+3*(Layer1) \u2192 Layer 2\nThen 1+3*(Layer2) \u2192 Layer3\n...\nUp to Layer9, because the expression has nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I had Layer1 to Layer9, each adding a layer, so the outermost is Layer9. So, yes, Layer9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with so many layers. Let me think about whether there's a recursive formula or a geometric series here.\n\nEach layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBut 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward until we reach the outermost layer. Multiplying this final layer by 3 gives the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost Layer):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Calculation:**\n    Multiply the result by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth layer.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me check:\n\nLayer 2: 3*4 + 1 = 13? 3*4=12+1=13. Yes.\n\nLayer 3: 3*13 +1=40? 39 +1=40. Yes.\n\nLayer 4: 3*40 +1=121. 120+1=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*121 +1=364. 363+1=364. Correct.\n\nSo, it seems like each layer n is defined by a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nHomogeneous solution: a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nParticular solution: Assume constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nPlugging into the equation: K = 3*K +1 \u21d2 K - 3K =1 \u21d2 -2K=1 \u21d2 K= -1/2.\n\nSo, general solution: a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3))...)).\n\nIf I expand this, each layer adds another term multiplied by 3^k, where k is the depth.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nWait, so each time, we're adding another term that's 3^n, where n is the number of layers.\n\nWait, but actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layers). So, if I have k layers, the expression would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)).\n\nWhich is similar to the sum of a geometric series.\n\nIn fact, the expression inside is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)).\n\nWhich is similar to the sum S = 1 + 3*S', where S' is the same expression but one layer less.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have a fixed number of layers, 9. So, it's a finite nested expression, not an infinite one.\n\nBut perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for it.\n\nWait, earlier, we saw that each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as starting with 3*(...), which is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, maybe another way to think about it is that the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it: the entire expression simplifies to (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBut since the problem is to compute it step by step, the first method is probably more illustrative.\n\nIn any case, after computing each layer step by step and confirming with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, leading to the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, I think I messed up the order. Let me try again more carefully. 29524 * 3: Start from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carryover.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carryover.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 0 * 3 = 0 + 2 = 2. Write down 2, no carryover.\n\nNext digit: 0 * 3 = 0. Write down 0.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Write down 6.\n\nSo, putting it all together from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 7, 7, 2, 0, 0, 6. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, so 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each layer was computed correctly, and the multiplication at the end is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed and used in the next layer. After computing the innermost nine layers, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 7, 7, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, reading from top, it's 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88,572. Let me confirm: 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000. 9,000*3=27,000. 500*3=1,500. 20*3=60. 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000. 87,000 +1,500=88,500. 88,500 +60=88,560. 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400=29,400 +120=29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that: 3*29,524=88,572. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think I've computed it correctly by expanding each layer step by step. Each time, I took the innermost value, multiplied by 3, added 1, and then used that result in the next layer. By repeating this process nine times, I arrived at the final value before multiplying by the outermost 3. I also double-checked each layer's computation to ensure there were no arithmetic errors, which helps prevent mistakes in the final answer. So, after careful step-by-step computation and verification, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. To solve it, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step. \n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe a better way is to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly: 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, no, because we started from the right: 4*3=12, so units place is 2, tens place is 7, hundreds place is 5, thousands place is 8, ten-thousands place is 8. So the number is 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the number is 88572. Let me verify this multiplication: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, because 30000*3=90000, which is a bit higher, so 29524*3 should be 88572, which is correct. So, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them together: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify Layer 1 through Layer 9 again. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I've got this right. The key was recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a pattern or formula to compute the layers efficiently instead of calculating each one manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing this pattern, we can compute each layer step by step or use a closed-form formula derived from a recurrence relation. \n\nUsing the recurrence relation approach:\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let's try a different approach. 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 =60000 9000*3=27000 500*3=1500 20*3=60 4*3=12 Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 +1500=88500 88500 +60=88560 88560 +12=88572. Okay, so that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 +3=4 (correct) Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13 (correct) Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 (correct) Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 (correct) Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 (correct) Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 (correct) Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 (correct) Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 (correct) Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But wait, let me check the multiplication again because I feel like 29524*3 might be off. Let me compute 29524 *3 step by step: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, writing it out: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is the first layer. Then, inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. It's 9 times, right? Because starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). So, there are 9 layers, meaning that Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost, which I then multiply by 3. So, yes, 9 layers, each computed correctly. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 +3=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since the numbers are manageable, computing each step is feasible. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The solution to this recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 +3 + 3^2*a_{n-2} = ... Continuing this, we get a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For n=1, a_1=4. Plugging into the formula: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, which is not 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my formula is wrong. Let me try to find the correct formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's compute a few terms: a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, a_4=1+3*40=121, etc. Let's see if we can find a pattern or a closed-form solution. The recurrence is linear and can be solved as follows: The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r-3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p =1 +3*a_p => a_p -3*a_p=1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. Perfect! So, the formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, which is consistent with our previous result. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to go through each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only 9 layers, both methods work. However, it's good to know that there's a formula here. So, to recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). This forms a recurrence relation which can be solved to find a closed-form expression, allowing us to compute the value directly for any number of layers. In this case, with 9 layers, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be solved by recognizing a recurrence pattern. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving the recurrence relation, we find that the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure of the expression, where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me verify that 29524\u00d73 is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 29524\u00d73 as (30000 - 476)\u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.

Layer 3:1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3\u00d740=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3\u00d7121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute it without going through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define a recursive formula. Let\u2019s say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3=1 +3*a_2=1+39=40. So, the sequence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let's find constants A and B. From the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C =1 \u2192 -2C=1 \u2192 C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, n=9. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and applying a formula. Each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which leads to the solution a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For nine layers, this results in a_9 = 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which would save time and reduce errors. Let me think about it. The structure of the expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k))*(k)^{n-1} + c/(1 - k), provided that k \u2260 1. In our case, k = 3 and c = 1. So, plugging in, we get a_n = (a_1 - 1/(1 - 3))*(3)^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3). Simplifying, 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. So, a_n = (a_1 + 1/2)*(3)^{n-1} - 1/2. But a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_n = (4 + 1/2)*(3)^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*(3)^{n-1} - 1/2. Simplifying further, a_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (9*3^{0} - 1)/2 = (9*1 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9*3^{1} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(9*9 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(9*27 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (9*3^{8} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^8 is 6561. So, 9*6561 = 59049. Then, 59049 -1 =59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer using the formula to confirm. Let's compute a_5 using the formula: a_5=(9*3^4 -1)/2= (9*81 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, I'm confident that the formula is correct and that the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me check the number of digits in 29524. It's 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4. So, when multiplying by 3, the result should be:\n\nLet me do it digit by digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 8 (from ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 2 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, that would be 88,572? Wait, no, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88,572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. But 29524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 29524 = 30,000 - 476. Therefore, 29524 * 3 = 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in each layer. Starting from the innermost: Layer1: 1+3=4 Layer2:1+3*4=13 Layer3:1+3*13=40 Layer4:1+3*40=121 Layer5:1+3*121=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for this recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is 4, as computed earlier. So, the general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer without computing each layer step by step. That's a good way to verify the result. Alternatively, if I had to compute this without recognizing the pattern, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see: Starting from the innermost layer, each term is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But since each term adds 1 before multiplying by 3, it's a bit different. But knowing that the closed-form exists for such linear recurrences, I can use that approach. Anyway, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the expression: each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as Layer 1 is 4.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as Layer 2 is 13.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, as computed earlier.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the key steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation to prevent errors.\n\n3. Realize that the recurrence relation could be solved with a formula, which was a good check on the step-by-step computation.\n\n4. Confirm that both methods lead to the same result, solidifying confidence in the answer.\n\nI think that covers it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is found to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n- 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n- 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n- 20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 13, Layer 3 is 40, Layer 4 is 121, Layer 5 is 364, Layer 6 is 1093, Layer 7 is 3280, Layer 8 is 9841, Layer 9 is 29524, and finally, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a couple of layers manually again. Let's take Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula, to see if I get the same result. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model it as such.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n goes from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, for n > 1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, we have a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, and we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nBut let's see. Alternatively, we can write the recurrence as:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, 3^{10} is 59049, so yes, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*(29524) = 88572, as we found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, I'll do a quick check on the exponents:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{11} is indeed 177147. Then subtracting 3 gives 177144, dividing by 2 gives 88572. All the steps check out.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( L_1 = 4 \\). Solving this recurrence, we find that each layer \\( L_n \\) can be expressed as \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

There are no more digits, so the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" introduces another layer. Let me count them: Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each step adds another layer. How many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then 1+3*(...), etc. How many times does this happen? Let me count the number of times \"1+\" appears. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me look at the expression again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each \"1+3(\" introduces a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\n1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...)\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1+3), then layer 2 is 1+3*(layer1), up to layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, when I computed up to layer9 as 29524, that was correct, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when I do it step by step, I might have missed a digit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric progression. The general solution for a_n is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, a_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step, so that's a good consistency check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see this as a geometric series from the start. Let me try to expand the expression:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nIf I denote the innermost expression as S, then each layer adds a 1 + 3*S, and so on.\n\nBut since I already have the recurrence relation approach, which gives me the same answer, I think that's solid.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe I can represent the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see.\n\nEach time I have a 3 multiplied by a term that includes 1, which in turn includes another 3, and so on. So, expanding the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I expand this, each 1 contributes a 3^k term, where k is the number of layers above it.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nLet me try:\n\nThe innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, it's 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40? Let me check: 1 + 3 = 4, +9 = 13, +27 = 40. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, each layer adds another power of 3. So, layer n has the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Because each time, you're adding another 3^k term.\n\nSo, for layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2, which is (9 - 1)/2 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40.\n\nYes, so each layer n is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^{n} = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWhich is exactly the formula I derived earlier.\n\nTherefore, layer9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both methods: step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series with a ratio of 3, starting from 3^1 up to 3^9, but I need to adjust for the initial 1 in each term.\n\nWait, actually, when I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I expand all the layers, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try expanding it step by step:\n\nStart from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40\n\nNext:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nNext:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by coefficients.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers.\n\nWait, but E is equal to 3*(1 + E'), where E' is the same structure with one less layer. But since there are nine layers, E' would have eight layers. Hmm, but that might complicate things because E and E' are similar but not the same. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula that can express E in terms of the number of layers.\n\nWait, but given that I've already solved it using the recurrence relation and step-by-step computation, and both methods gave me the same answer, I'm pretty confident that 88572 is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent every time.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the multiplications:\n\n- Layer2: 3*4=12, 1+12=13. Correct.\n\n- Layer3:3*13=39, 1+39=40. Correct.\n\n- Layer4:3*40=120, 1+120=121. Correct.\n\n- Layer5:3*121=363, 1+363=364. Correct.\n\n- Layer6:3*364=1092, 1+1092=1093.

Correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.

Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, that's 88572? Let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 7, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, I'm a bit confused because when I was computing the layers, I thought Layer 9 was 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me make sure that each layer was computed correctly. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing the innermost part, each layer adds another 3*(...). So, maybe I should have considered that the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's what I did. So, 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive formula where each term is based on the previous one. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f. Perfect, the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, now, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using the closed-form formula also gives me 88572, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the innermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe another way: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods, step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer using the formula. Let's say a_4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, yes, the formula is correct. Therefore, confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we can systematically simplify the expression. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows us to derive a formula, which confirms our step-by-step calculations. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me verify: 29524 *3: 29524 +29524=59048, then +29524 again: 59048 +29524=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13 Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=1+3=4. Then each subsequent term is 1 +3 times the previous term. So, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc., which is exactly what I did. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, is that right? Let me test it. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1, but our a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe the formula is different. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=1. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r-3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form A. Substituting into the recurrence: A =1 +3*A => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing step by step and using the recurrence relation formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using the recurrence relation formula, we determine that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, rewrite the recurrence as:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, the innermost expression is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I can compute a_9 directly without having to compute each layer, which is much faster and reduces the chance of errors.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, using the closed-form expression to verify each layer.\n\nGiven a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nCompute each a_n from 1 to 9:\n\na_1 = (3^2 -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4\n\na_2=(3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40\n\na_4=(3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121\n\na_5=(3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364\n\na_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093\n\na_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280\n\na_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841\n\na_9=(3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nYes, all correct. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be extra careful, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the standard multiplication method:\n\n   29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n   88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward and using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). The innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. **Define a Recursive Sequence**: Let a_n be the value of the nth layer, where a_1 = 4 and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\n3. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - a_1 = 4\n   - a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Derive a Closed-Form Formula**: The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved to find a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n5. **Compute a_9 Using the Formula**: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n6. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me check again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, right? Let me write it out properly: 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, that seems correct because 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Let me check with another method: 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. But since it's 29,524, which is 30,000 - 476. So, 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29,524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572. So, that's the answer. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can write the characteristic equation as r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, L_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^{10}=59,049, 3^{11}=177,147. So, (177,147 -3)/2 =177,144/2=88,572. Same result. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined by $1 + 3 \\times$ the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. Layer 2: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n3. Layer 3: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n4.

Wait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. But let me verify that computation because sometimes when we compute step by step, it's easy to make an error. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.

Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K =1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which we computed as a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, because n=1 corresponds to the innermost layer, so the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result using the formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that would be 778572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so 29524 * 3 should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, so 2 with carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, so 5 with carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, so 7 with carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing from the last step to the first: 7 (from 2*3 +1), then 7 (from 5*3 +2), then 8 (from 9*3 +1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3 +1), and finally 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that seems conflicting. Maybe I should write it as:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nDigit 1: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\nDigit 2: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nDigit3:5*3=15 \u21925, carryover1.\n\nDigit4:9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2.\n\nDigit5:5*3=15 +2=17 \u21927, carryover1.\n\nDigit6:2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, the number is 7 (from digit6) followed by 7 (digit5), 8 (digit4),5 (digit3),7 (digit2),2 (digit1). So, 778572. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. 29524 * 3 = 88572, right? Wait, let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method to verify. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nLet's add:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 +1=7.\n\n0 +5=5.\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carryover1.\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8.\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 *3=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.

By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my layers because if I made a mistake in one of the layers, the entire result will be wrong.

Each step seems correct, so I think I can be confident that 88572 is the right answer. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial conditions. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=0: Hmm, wait, but n starts at 1. Alternatively, maybe we can find a pattern. Let's compute the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each a_n seems to be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this hypothesis.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this seems to hold. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, both methods give the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have used the recursive formula to compute each layer step by step, which I did initially. Either way, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a geometric series.
