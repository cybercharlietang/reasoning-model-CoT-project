    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me write this down more clearly so I can visualize it better. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis, that's a new layer. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, no, actually, let me check again. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of 3s that are outside the parentheses. Starting from the left: first 3, then another 3, and so on. Let me see: each time, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times another expression). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times I see a \"1 + 3(...)\". Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each time moving outward, each layer adds another 3(1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. \n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to work from the inside out. Let's start by evaluating the innermost expression and then build our way up. So, let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, since there are nine layers. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: L1 is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, L2 is 3*(1 + 3*L1). Since L1 is 4, then:\n\nL2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Wait, no, L2 is actually 3*(1 + 3*(L1)). So, substituting L1 = 4, we have:\n\n3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving to L3, which is 3*(1 + 3*L2). So, substituting L2 = 39:\n\nL3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nHmm, that's a big jump. Let me make sure I did that correctly. 3*39 is 117, plus 1 is 118, times 3 is 354. Yes, that's correct.\n\nMoving on to L4: 3*(1 + 3*L3). So, substituting L3 = 354:\n\nL4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063\n\nWait, 3*354 is 1062, plus 1 is 1063, times 3 is 3189. That's a huge number. Let me check that again: 354*3 is indeed 1062, plus 1 is 1063, times 3 is 3189. Okay, moving on.\n\nL5: 3*(1 + 3*L4). Substituting L4 = 3189:\n\nL5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568\n\nWait, 3*3189 is 9567, plus 1 is 9568, times 3 is 28704. Hmm, that's getting really big. Let me confirm: 3189*3 is 9567, yes, plus 1 is 9568, times 3 is 28704. Correct.\n\nL6: 3*(1 + 3*L5). Substituting L5 = 28704:\n\nL6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113\n\nCalculating 3*86113: Let's see, 80000*3 = 240000, 6000*3=18000, 100*3=300, 13*3=39. Adding them up: 240000 + 18000 = 258000, plus 300 is 258300, plus 39 is 258339. So, L6 = 258339.\n\nWait, that seems correct. 28704*3 is indeed 86112, plus 1 is 86113, times 3 is 258339. Okay.\n\nL7: 3*(1 + 3*L6). Substituting L6 = 258339:\n\nL7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018\n\nCalculating 3*775018: 700000*3=2100000, 75000*3=225000, 18*3=54. Adding up: 2100000 + 225000 = 2325000, plus 54 is 2325054. So, L7 = 2325054.\n\nLet me double-check: 258339*3 is 775017, plus 1 is 775018, times 3 is indeed 2325054. Correct.\n\nL8: 3*(1 + 3*L7). Substituting L7 = 2325054:\n\nL8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163\n\nCalculating 3*6975163: Let's break it down. 6,000,000*3=18,000,000; 975,163*3=2,925,489. So, adding them together: 18,000,000 + 2,925,489 = 20,925,489. So, L8 = 20,925,489.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 2325054*3: 2,000,000*3=6,000,000; 325,054*3=975,162. So, 6,000,000 + 975,162 = 6,975,162. Then, plus 1 is 6,975,163, times 3 is 20,925,489. Correct.\n\nFinally, L9: 3*(1 + 3*L8). Substituting L8 = 20,925,489:\n\nL9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468\n\nCalculating 3*62,776,468: Let's break it down. 60,000,000*3=180,000,000; 2,776,468*3=8,329,404. Adding them together: 180,000,000 + 8,329,404 = 188,329,404.\n\nWait, let me verify the multiplication step by step. 20,925,489 * 3: 20,000,000*3=60,000,000; 925,489*3=2,776,467. So, 60,000,000 + 2,776,467 = 62,776,467. Then, adding 1 gives 62,776,468, which multiplied by 3 is 188,329,404. That seems correct.\n\nSo, after computing all the layers from L1 to L9, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with such large numbers. Let me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39\n\nL3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(118) = 354\n\nL4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1063) = 3189\n\nL5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(9568) = 28704\n\nL6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(86113) = 258339\n\nL7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(775018) = 2325054\n\nL8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(6975163) = 20,925,489\n\nL9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(62,776,468) = 188,329,404\n\nHmm, each step seems consistent. So, I think I did this correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which is time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer). Let's denote each layer as a_i, where i is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 3*(1 + 3*a_1) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39. Similarly, a_3 = 3*(1 + 3*a_2) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*118 = 354, and so on.\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, which would allow me to compute the nth term without having to calculate each preceding term. That might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nLet me consider the general form of the recursion. Let\u2019s define a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nExpanding this recursion, let's see if we can find a pattern.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3 + 9*4 = 3 + 36 = 39\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3 + 9*39 = 3 + 351 = 354\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3 + 9*354 = 3 + 3186 = 3189\n\nHmm, I can see that each a_n is 3 + 9*a_{n-1}. Let me write this as a linear recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 9*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 9*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 9 = 0, so r = 9. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*9^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 9*C + 3\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 9C = 3\n\n-8C = 3\n\nC = -3/8\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*9^n + (-3/8)\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*9^1 + (-3/8)\n\n4 = 9A - 3/8\n\nAdding 3/8 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/8 = 9A\n\nConvert 4 to eighths: 32/8 + 3/8 = 35/8\n\nSo, 35/8 = 9A\n\nTherefore, A = (35/8)/9 = 35/(8*9) = 35/72\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8\n\nSimplify this:\n\na_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8\n\nWe can write 9^n as 9^(n), so:\n\na_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1:\n\na_1 = (35/72)*9^1 - 3/8 = (35/72)*9 - 3/8\n\nCalculate (35/72)*9: 35/8, since 9/72=1/8, so 35*(1/8)=35/8.\n\nThen, 35/8 - 3/8 = 32/8 = 4, which matches a_1=4. Good.\n\nLet me check n=2:\n\na_2 = (35/72)*9^2 - 3/8 = (35/72)*81 - 3/8\n\nCalculate (35/72)*81: 35*(81/72) = 35*(9/8) = (35*9)/8 = 315/8\n\nThen, 315/8 - 3/8 = 312/8 = 39, which matches a_2=39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=3:\n\na_3 = (35/72)*9^3 - 3/8 = (35/72)*729 - 3/8\n\nCalculate (35/72)*729: 35*(729/72) = 35*(10.125) = 35*10 + 35*0.125 = 350 + 4.375 = 354.375\n\nThen, 354.375 - 0.375 = 354, which matches a_3=354. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for any n, a_n can be computed using this formula. Since our problem has 9 layers, we need to compute a_9.\n\nSo, plugging n=9 into the formula:\n\na_9 = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8\n\nFirst, let's compute 9^9. Let me calculate that step by step:\n\n9^1 = 9\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n9^3 = 729\n\n9^4 = 6561\n\n9^5 = 59049\n\n9^6 = 531441\n\n9^7 = 4782969\n\n9^8 = 43046721\n\n9^9 = 387420489\n\nSo, 9^9 = 387,420,489\n\nNow, compute (35/72)*387,420,489:\n\nFirst, let's compute 387,420,489 \u00f7 72:\n\n387,420,489 \u00f7 72.\n\nWell, 72 \u00d7 5,000,000 = 360,000,000\n\nSubtract that from 387,420,489: 387,420,489 - 360,000,000 = 27,420,489\n\nNow, 72 \u00d7 380,000 = 27,360,000\n\nSubtract that: 27,420,489 - 27,360,000 = 60,489\n\nNow, 72 \u00d7 840 = 60,480\n\nSubtract that: 60,489 - 60,480 = 9\n\nSo, total is 5,000,000 + 380,000 + 840 + (9/72) = 5,380,840 + 0.125 = 5,380,840.125\n\nSo, 387,420,489 \u00f7 72 = 5,380,840.125\n\nNow, multiply by 35:\n\n35 \u00d7 5,380,840.125\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 5,380,840 \u00d7 35:\n\nCompute 5,380,840 \u00d7 30 = 161,425,200\n\nCompute 5,380,840 \u00d7 5 = 26,904,200\n\nAdd them together: 161,425,200 + 26,904,200 = 188,329,400\n\nNow, compute 0.125 \u00d7 35 = 4.375\n\nSo, total is 188,329,400 + 4.375 = 188,329,404.375\n\nNow, subtract 3/8 from this:\n\n188,329,404.375 - 0.375 = 188,329,404\n\nSo, a_9 = 188,329,404\n\nThis matches exactly what I got when I computed each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 188,329,404.\n\nI think I've double-checked this thoroughly, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer). By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute the value as follows:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Work outward layer by layer:\n   - \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 4) = 3 \\times 13 = 39\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 39) = 3 \\times 118 = 354\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 354) = 3 \\times 1063 = 3189\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 3189) = 3 \\times 9568 = 28704\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 28704) = 3 \\times 86113 = 258339\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 258339) = 3 \\times 775018 = 2325054\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 2325054) = 3 \\times 6975163 = 20925489\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 20925489) = 3 \\times 62776468 = 188329404\\)\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{188329404}$"

So, there are nine ( in total, meaning nine layers. Therefore, the expression is 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times ... nine times. So, to compute this, I can start from the innermost layer and work my way outwards.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on, up to L9 = 1 + 3*L8. Then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so L1 is the innermost 1+3, then L2 is 1 + 3*L1, etc., up to L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9. Wait, no, perhaps I should index it differently because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe the innermost is L1 = 1+3, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, ..., up to L9 = 1 + 3*L8, and then the entire expression is 3*L9. Wait, but let me check: the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so that would be 3*L9, where L9 is 1 + 3*L8. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step, starting from L1 and moving outward.\n\nCompute L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000*3=60000\n\n- 9000*3=27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000? Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000? Wait, no, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, but 29524 is 29000 + 524. So, perhaps better to compute digit by digit.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3=12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n- 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n- 5*3=15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n- 9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n- 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading from top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. I thought there were nine layers, but let me check again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each layer is after each 3. Let me count the number of 3's before a (1+3(...). \n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(... \u2192 that's layer 1.\n\nThen inside, another 3(1+3(... \u2192 layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent ( is a new layer. Let me count the number of (:\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then another ( after the next 3: 2\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n10. 3(\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me count each ( in the string.\n\nThe string is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of ( is as follows:\n\n1. After the first 3: 1\n2. Then another ( after the next 3: 2\n3. Then another ( after the next 3: 3\n4. Then another ( after the next 3:4\n5. Then another ( after the next 3:5\n6. Then another ( after the next 3:6\n7. Then another ( after the next 3:7\n8. Then another ( after the next 3:8\n9. Then another ( after the next 3:9\n\nAfter that, the innermost is 1+3, which doesn't have another (. So, total of nine (.\n\nTherefore, there are nine layers, meaning L1 to L9, as I computed earlier. So, my computation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding step by step is manageable.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each layer, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). This resembles a recursive formula where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's a common type that can be solved using various methods, such as iteration or finding a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, where k and c are constants. In this case, k=3 and c=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - k)) + (a_1 - c/(1 - k))*k^{n-1}.\n\nWait, let me check that formula. For a linear recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (c/(1 - k)) * (k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1) + a_0*k^{n}.\n\nWait, perhaps I should derive it properly.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A =1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, as L1=4.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as L2=13.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, as L3=40.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, the value at layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9, which gives a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it directly without expanding each layer, which is more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut since in this problem n=9, expanding step by step is manageable, and the formula confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1 (L1):** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2 (L2):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3 (L3):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4 (L4):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5 (L5):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6 (L6):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7 (L7):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8 (L8):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9 (L9):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is the last term: $1+3$. That seems straightforward. So, I'll compute that first. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost part: $1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost parentheses to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. The something here is the result we just got, which is 4. So, let's compute that:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3(4)$.\n\nHmm, so 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives us 13. Let me note that down:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13$.\n\nGreat, so now that simplifies the next set of parentheses to 13. Moving out another level, we have another expression of the form $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. The something here is the 13 we just calculated. So, let's compute that:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3(13)$.\n\n3 times 13 is 39, and adding 1 gives us 40. So, that simplifies to 40. Let me write that down:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40$.\n\nAlright, moving out another level, we again have the same structure: $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. The something is now 40, so:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3(40)$.\n\n3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that simplifies to 121. Let me record that:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121$.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where something is 121. Let's compute that:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3(121)$.\n\n3 times 121 is... hmm, let me think. 120 times 3 is 360, and 1 times 3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, adding 1 gives us 364. So, that's 364. Let me write that down:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364$.\n\nMoving out another level, the expression is again $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. The something here is 364. Let's compute that:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3(364)$.\n\nCalculating 3 times 364: 300 times 3 is 900, 60 times 3 is 180, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives us 1093. So, that simplifies to 1093. Let me note that:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093$.\n\nNow, moving out another level, we have the same structure: $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. The something here is 1093. Let's compute that:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3(1093)$.\n\nCalculating 3 times 1093: 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives us 3280. So, that's 3280. Let me write that down:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280$.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where something is 3280. Let's compute that:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3(3280)$.\n\nCalculating 3 times 3280: 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, 80 times 3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives us 9841. Let me note that:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841$.\n\nMoving out another level, we have the same expression: $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, with something being 9841. Let's compute that:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3(9841)$.\n\nCalculating 3 times 9841: 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. Let me write that down:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524$.\n\nAlright, moving out another level, the expression is again $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where something is 29524. Let's compute that:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3(29524)$.\n\nCalculating 3 times 29524: Let's break it down. 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives us 88573. Let me note that:\n\nNext level: $1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573$.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost level, we have the original expression which is 3 times the entire inner expression we've been computing. So, the entire expression simplifies to 3 multiplied by the result we just got, which is 88573. Let me compute that:\n\nFinal level: $3 \\times 88573$.\n\nCalculating 3 times 88573: Let's break it down. 80000 times 3 is 240000, 8000 times 3 is 24000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 70 times 3 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3 times 88573 is 265719.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I break numbers down, it's easy to miscount the digits or miscompute a part.\n\nSo, 88573 multiplied by 3:\n\n- 3 times 3 is 9. Write down 9.\n- 3 times 7 is 21. Write down 1, carry over 2.\n- 3 times 5 is 15, plus the carried 2 is 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 3 times 8 is 24, plus the carried 1 is 25. Write down 5, carry over 2.\n- 3 times 8 is 24, plus the carried 2 is 26. Write down 26.\n\nPutting it all together: 265719. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step involved multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After simplifying each level, we ended up with the outermost multiplication by 3, which gave us 265719.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything or make a miscalculation:\n\n1. Innermost: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. Next: $1 + 3(4) = 13$\n3. Next: $1 + 3(13) = 40$\n4. Next: $1 + 3(40) = 121$\n5. Next: $1 + 3(121) = 364$\n6. Next: $1 + 3(364) = 1093$\n7. Next: $1 + 3(1093) = 3280$\n8. Next: $1 + 3(3280) = 9841$\n9. Next: $1 + 3(9841) = 29524$\n10. Next: $1 + 3(29524) = 88573$\n11. Finally: $3 \\times 88573 = 265719$\n\nEach step seems correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations. So, the final result is 265719.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each step manually. Since each term is of the form $1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous term}$, it seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me try to see if I can find a pattern. Let's denote each term as $a_n$, where $n$ is the level from the inside out. So, starting from the innermost as $a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4$, then $a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13$, and so on, up to $a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 88573$, and the final result is $3a_9 = 265719$.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is $a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$, with $a_1 = 4$.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving $a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0$, which has a characteristic equation of $r - 3 = 0$, so $r = 3$. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is $A \\times 3^n$.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say $C$. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\n$C = 1 + 3C$\n\nSolving for $C$:\n\n$C - 3C = 1$\n\n$-2C = 1$\n\n$C = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\n$a_n = A \\times 3^n + (-\\frac{1}{2})$\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When $n = 1$, $a_1 = 4$.\n\nSo,\n\n$4 = A \\times 3^1 - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$4 = 3A - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nAdding $\\frac{1}{2}$ to both sides:\n\n$4 + \\frac{1}{2} = 3A$\n\n$\\frac{9}{2} = 3A$\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\n$A = \\frac{9}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{2}$\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\n$a_n = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 3^n - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$\n\nSo, for each $n$, $a_n$ is equal to $(3^{n+1} - 1)/2$.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 levels of nesting, so $n = 9$ for the innermost term. Wait, actually, let me check. When we started, the innermost was $a_1 = 4$, and each subsequent level was $a_2$, up to $a_9$. So, the final term before multiplying by 3 is $a_9$.\n\nTherefore, $a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2}$\n\nCalculating $3^{10}$:\n\n$3^1 = 3$\n\n$3^2 = 9$\n\n$3^3 = 27$\n\n$3^4 = 81$\n\n$3^5 = 243$\n\n$3^6 = 729$\n\n$3^7 = 2187$\n\n$3^8 = 6561$\n\n$3^9 = 19683$\n\n$3^{10} = 59049$\n\nSo, $a_9 = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \\frac{59048}{2} = 29524$\n\nWait, but earlier, when we computed step by step, $a_9$ was 88573. Hmm, that doesn't match. There must be a confusion in the indexing.\n\nWait, let's think again. When I defined $a_n$ as starting from the innermost, which was $1 + 3$, so that was $a_1 = 4$. Then, each subsequent $a_n$ was built by going outward. So, in total, how many levels are there?\n\nLooking back at the original problem: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, it's 9. So, there are 9 nested terms. So, starting from the innermost as $a_1 = 4$, each step outward is $a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$, so for 9 levels, we have $a_9$.\n\nBut according to the formula, $a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2$, so $a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524$.\n\nBut when I computed step by step earlier, I got $a_9 = 88573$. That's a discrepancy. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps my indexing is off. Let me recount the number of levels.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. $1 + 3 = 4$ (this is the innermost, let's call this level 1)\n2. $1 + 3(4) = 13$ (level 2)\n3. $1 + 3(13) = 40$ (level 3)\n4. $1 + 3(40) = 121$ (level 4)\n5. $1 + 3(121) = 364$ (level 5)\n6. $1 + 3(364) = 1093$ (level 6)\n7. $1 + 3(1093) = 3280$ (level 7)\n8. $1 + 3(3280) = 9841$ (level 8)\n9. $1 + 3(9841) = 29524$ (level 9)\n10. Then, the outermost multiplication by 3: $3 \\times 29524 = 88572$.\n\nWait, hold on, that's different. So, in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 88573, but now I see that when I index properly, the 9th level is 29524, and then the final result is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I thought the final step was 3 times 88573, but that seems to be incorrect.\n\nLet me go back. When I computed step by step, I had:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (level 1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (level 2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (level 3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (level 4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (level 5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (level 6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (level 7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (level 8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (level 9)\n10. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so in my initial step-by-step, I mistakenly labeled the 9th level as 88573, but actually, that was the outermost multiplication. So, my bad. The correct final result is 88572.\n\nBut according to the formula, $a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524$, which matches the step-by-step computation. Then, the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial computation, I thought the final result was 265719. That was incorrect because I miscounted the levels. So, actually, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because when I computed step by step earlier, I had:\n\nAfter 9 levels, I had 88573, and then I multiplied by 3 to get 265719. But now, with proper indexing, I see that the 9th level is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nSo, where was the mistake? Let me recount the levels.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (level 1)\n2. 1 + 3(4) = 13 (level 2)\n3. 1 + 3(13) = 40 (level 3)\n4. 1 + 3(40) = 121 (level 4)\n5. 1 + 3(121) = 364 (level 5)\n6. 1 + 3(364) = 1093 (level 6)\n7. 1 + 3(1093) = 3280 (level 7)\n8. 1 + 3(3280) = 9841 (level 8)\n9. 1 + 3(9841) = 29524 (level 9)\n10. Then, 3(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, the 9 levels correspond to the 9 nested parentheses. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut in my initial computation, I mistakenly thought that the 9th level was 88573, which was incorrect. So, the correct final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but in the step-by-step earlier, I had:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, 10 steps in total, but the 9th step is 29524, and the 10th is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, according to the formula, $a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2$, where n is the number of levels. Since we have 9 levels, $a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524$, and the final result is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nSo, my initial step-by-step computation was correct up to 29524, and then the final step was 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut in my initial thought process, I thought the final result was 265719 because I miscounted the levels and thought that the outermost multiplication was the 10th level, but actually, it's just the final step after the 9th level.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this formula approach. If $a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2$, then for n=1, $a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4$, which matches. For n=2, $a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13$, which matches. For n=3, $a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 40$, which matches. So, the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, $a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524$, and then the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to 88573 and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719, which was wrong because I miscounted the levels.\n\nTherefore, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me just confirm with another approach. Let's compute the expression step by step again, carefully, to ensure that I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think the confusion earlier was because I miscounted the levels and thought that the 9th level was 88573, but in reality, the 9th level is 29524, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the number of multiplications by 3. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, starting from 1, each step is 3*(previous +1). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nStart: 1\n\nStep 1: 3*(1 + 1) = 6\n\nWait, no, that's not matching. Wait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a recurrence relation where each term is built as 1 + 3*previous term. So, as I did before, with $a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$, and $a_1 = 4$.\n\nBut regardless, the formula approach and the step-by-step both lead to 88572 as the final result.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous term}\\). By systematically simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward, each level is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nSo, the expression is built like this: starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), and then each subsequent layer wraps another 1+3 around it. Let me try to write down each step so I don't get confused. Maybe I can start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and then work my way outwards, simplifying each part as I go. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, that part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). The inner part we just computed was 4, so now we have (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 plus 12 is 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\nAlright, moving another layer out, we have another (1 + 3*(...)). The inner part here is 13, so it's (1 + 3*13). Let me calculate 3 times 13 first. 3 times 13 is 39, and then 1 plus 39 is 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is (1 + 3*40). Let me compute that. 3 times 40 is 120, and 1 plus 120 is 121. So, now we have 121.\n\nNext layer out is (1 + 3*121). Let's see, 3 times 121. Hmm, 120 times 3 is 360, and 1 more would make it 363. So, 3*121 is 363, and then 1 plus 363 is 364. So, that's 364.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*364). Let me compute 3 times 364. 300 times 3 is 900, 60 times 3 is 180, and 4 times 3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 plus 1092 is 1093.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 plus 3279 is 3280.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is (1 + 3*3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 plus 9840 is 9841.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*9841). Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 plus 29523 is 29524.\n\nNow, moving to the next layer out, we have (1 + 3*29524). Let me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 plus 88572 is 88573.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*88573). Let me compute 3*88573. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 plus 265719 is 265720.\n\nWait a minute, let me check that. Did I compute 3*88573 correctly? Let me do it another way to confirm. 88573 times 3. Let me break it down:\n\n88,573 * 3:\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n- 3 * 7 = 21, carry over 2\n- 3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carry over 1\n- 3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carry over 2\n- 3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26\n\nSo, writing it down: 265,719. Then, 1 + 265,719 is 265,720. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*265720). Let me compute 3*265720. 200,000 * 3 is 600,000, 60,000 * 3 is 180,000, 5,000 * 3 is 15,000, 700 * 3 is 2,100, 20 * 3 is 60. Adding those together: 600,000 + 180,000 is 780,000, plus 15,000 is 795,000, plus 2,100 is 797,100, plus 60 is 797,160. Then, 1 plus 797,160 is 797,161.\n\nWait, hold on, 3 times 265,720. Let me check that again. 265,720 * 3:\n\n200,000 * 3 = 600,000\n60,000 * 3 = 180,000\n5,000 * 3 = 15,000\n700 * 3 = 2,100\n20 * 3 = 60\n0 * 3 = 0\n\nAdding them up: 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000\n780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000\n795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100\n797,100 + 60 = 797,160\n797,160 + 0 = 797,160\n\nThen, 1 + 797,160 is 797,161. So that's correct.\n\nNow, moving to the next layer out: (1 + 3*797161). Let me compute 3*797,161. Let me break this down:\n\n700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n90,000 * 3 = 270,000\n7,000 * 3 = 21,000\n100 * 3 = 300\n60 * 3 = 180\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding those together: 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000\n2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300\n2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480\n2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483\n\nThen, 1 + 2,391,483 is 2,391,484.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 797,161 * 3:\n\n700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n90,000 * 3 = 270,000\n7,000 * 3 = 21,000\n100 * 3 = 300\n60 * 3 = 180\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding up: 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000\n2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300\n2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480\n2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483\n\nSo, 1 + 2,391,483 is indeed 2,391,484.\n\nNow, moving to the outermost layer: (1 + 3*2,391,484). Let me compute 3*2,391,484. Let me break this down:\n\n2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000\n300,000 * 3 = 900,000\n90,000 * 3 = 270,000\n1,000 * 3 = 3,000\n400 * 3 = 1,200\n80 * 3 = 240\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding those together: 6,000,000 + 900,000 = 6,900,000\n6,900,000 + 270,000 = 7,170,000\n7,170,000 + 3,000 = 7,173,000\n7,173,000 + 1,200 = 7,174,200\n7,174,200 + 240 = 7,174,440\n7,174,440 + 12 = 7,174,452\n\nSo, 3 times 2,391,484 is 7,174,452. Then, adding 1 gives us 7,174,453.\n\nWait, let me check that again because that's a big number. 2,391,484 * 3.\n\n2,391,484 * 3:\n\n2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000\n300,000 * 3 = 900,000\n90,000 * 3 = 270,000\n1,000 * 3 = 3,000\n400 * 3 = 1,200\n80 * 3 = 240\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n6,000,000 + 900,000 = 6,900,000\n6,900,000 + 270,000 = 7,170,000\n7,170,000 + 3,000 = 7,173,000\n7,173,000 + 1,200 = 7,174,200\n7,174,200 + 240 = 7,174,440\n7,174,440 + 12 = 7,174,452\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 1 + 7,174,452 is 7,174,453.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, we have 3*(7,174,453). Let me compute that. 7,174,453 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n7,000,000 * 3 = 21,000,000\n174,000 * 3 = 522,000\n453 * 3 = 1,359\n\nAdding them together:\n\n21,000,000 + 522,000 = 21,522,000\n21,522,000 + 1,359 = 21,523,359\n\nWait, let me verify that. 7,174,453 * 3:\n\n7,000,000 * 3 = 21,000,000\n174,000 * 3 = 522,000\n453 * 3 = 1,359\n\nAdding up:\n\n21,000,000 + 522,000 = 21,522,000\n21,522,000 + 1,359 = 21,523,359\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 times 7,174,453 is 21,523,359.\n\nWait a second, let me check 7,174,453 * 3 another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n7,174,453\n*          3\n-----------\nStarting from the right:\n3*3 = 9\n3*5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n3*4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1\n3*4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1\n3*7 = 21 + 1 = 22, write down 2, carry over 2\n3*1 = 3 + 2 = 5\n3*7 = 21\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me write it properly:\n\n          7,174,453\n        x         3\n        ------------\n          21,523,359\n\nWait, let me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n3 * 3 = 9\n3 * 5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n3 * 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1\n3 * 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1\n3 * 7 = 21 + 1 = 22, write down 2, carry over 2\n3 * 1 = 3 + 2 = 5\n3 * 7 = 21\n\nSo, writing it out: 21,523,359. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 21,523,359.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations because this is a very large number, and it's easy to make an error in such a long computation. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could simplify this process instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. a_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. a_11 = 1 + 3*a_10 = 1 + 3*88573 = 265720. a_12 = 1 + 3*a_11 = 1 + 3*265720 = 797161. a_13 = 1 + 3*a_12 = 1 + 3*797161 = 2391484. a_14 = 1 + 3*a_13 = 1 + 3*2391484 = 7174453. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_14 = 3*7174453 = 21523359.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with 21,523,359, which is the same as 21523359 without the comma. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think my answer is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nn=10: a_10 = (3^11 -1)/2 = (177147 -1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573. Correct.\n\nn=11: a_11 = (3^12 -1)/2 = (531441 -1)/2 = 531440/2 = 265720. Correct.\n\nn=12: a_12 = (3^13 -1)/2 = (1594323 -1)/2 = 1594322/2 = 797161. Correct.\n\nn=13: a_13 = (3^14 -1)/2 = (4782969 -1)/2 = 4782968/2 = 2391484. Correct.\n\nn=14: a_14 = (3^15 -1)/2 = (14348907 -1)/2 = 14348906/2 = 7174453. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly for each layer. Therefore, the final term a_14 is 7174453, and then the entire expression is 3*a_14 = 3*7174453 = 21523359.\n\nThus, the computed value is 21,523,359. I think that's correct. I double-checked using both step-by-step computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute the result efficiently. The final value is computed as:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 7,174,453 = 21,523,359\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{21523359}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let me write this down step by step. I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost part and work my way out. That way, each time I solve a part, I can substitute it back into the larger expression. Let's see how that goes.\n\nThe innermost part of the expression is the last term, which is 1+3. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's simple, 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one step out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that.\n\n3*4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that.\n\n3*13 is 39, and adding 1 gives 40. So, this layer becomes 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer is 1 + 3*40. Let's do that.\n\n3*40 is 120, and adding 1 gives 121. So, this part simplifies to 121.\n\nNext, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that.\n\n3*121 is... Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then adding 1 gives 364. So, this layer is 364.\n\nMoving out another step, we have 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate that.\n\n3*364: Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then adding 1 gives 1093. So, this part simplifies to 1093.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*1093. Let me figure that out.\n\n3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then adding 1 gives 3280. So, this layer becomes 3280.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute that.\n\n3*3280: Well, 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then adding 1 gives 9841. So, this part simplifies to 9841.\n\nNext, the outermost layer before the final multiplication is 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate that.\n\n3*9841: Hmm, let's see. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then adding 1 gives 29524. So, this layer simplifies to 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. But remember, the original problem has a 3 multiplied by this entire expression. So, the last step is to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each step simplifies the expression until we reach the final result of 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me verify this multiplication.\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n- 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 5*3 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 8*3 = 24, plus 2 is 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n- 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 5*3 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 4*3 = 12, plus 1 is 13, write down 3, carry over 1.\n- 1*3 = 3, plus 1 is 4.\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe another way. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carryover 1.\n\n4 * 3 = 12 + 1 = 13, write 3, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nWait, this seems inconsistent. Maybe I should do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Wait, but we've already passed the digits. Wait, no, 29524 is a five-digit number. Wait, let me count the digits again.\n\nWait, 29524 is actually a five-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n- Tens place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n- Hundreds place:5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n- Thousands place:9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n- Ten thousands place:2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. So, 29524 \u00d73 is indeed 88572. So, my initial calculation was correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I can confidently say that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward:\n\n1. Compute \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n3. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n4. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n5. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n6. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n7. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n8. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n9. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n10. Finally, multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, I see that the innermost part is (1+3). Let me write that down. So, starting from the inside:\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that innermost result. Let me write that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(innermost result) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, that level becomes 13. \n\nNow, moving out another level, the next expression is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that would be:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating that, 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So, that level is 40.\n\nContinuing this way, each time I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. So, let me try to tabulate this step by step to keep track.\n\nLet me list the levels from the innermost to the outermost. Since there are nine sets of parentheses, that means there are nine levels. Wait, let me count: starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent level adds another (1+3*...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, the 3 is multiplied by another (1 + ...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step out adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, let's count the number of times 1 + 3*(...). I think there are nine instances of 1 + 3*(...), but I might be miscounting. Let me try to parse it:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each level out is another (1 + 3*(...)). So, let's count the number of these innermost expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, I might have miscounted. Let me check again. Each time I compute a level, it's another step out. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, the next one is 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Next, 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Then, 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Next, 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Then, 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Next, 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Then, 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Next, 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nSo, that's nine levels, right? Because each time, we're adding another (1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is level 1, then each step out is level 2, up to level 9. Then, after computing up to level 9, which is 29524, we have the entire expression as 3*(29524). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the entire nested part. So, actually, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the nested expression. So, let me clarify:\n\nThe structure is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each level out is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's count how many times we do this. Let me write it out step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after computing up to Level 9, which is the outermost nested expression, we have 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final computation is:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nNow, let's compute that. 3 multiplied by 29524. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this problem in terms of a recursive formula. Let's denote each level as a_n, where n is the level number starting from the innermost. Then, the recursive formula would be:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3\n\na_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9\n\nSo, computing a_1 through a_9 as above gives us a_9 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nI can also consider whether there's a closed-form solution for such a recurrence relation. The general form of a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c can often be solved using standard techniques. In this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 1\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this is by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added, it's not a straightforward geometric series. However, the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation is a more appropriate approach here.\n\nIn summary, by methodically computing each level from the innermost parentheses outward and verifying the result using a closed-form solution derived from the recurrence relation, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each level is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, starting from the innermost parentheses. By iteratively computing each level and then multiplying the final result by 3, we find the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   - Level 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. For each subsequent level, compute \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\):\n   - Level 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Level 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Level 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Level 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Level 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Level 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Level 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Level 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. Multiply the result of Level 9 by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down: the innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's simple enough. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me parse that correctly. It's 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, the next level would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that level gives me 13.\n\nNow, moving another level out, the next expression would be 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, now I have 40. \n\nContinuing this pattern, the next level out would be 1 + 3*(40). Let me calculate that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that's 121.\n\nMoving another step out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(121). Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives me 364. So, 364 is the result here.\n\nNext, the expression becomes 1 + 3*(364). Calculating that: 3*364 is 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nContinuing outward, the next one is 1 + 3*(1093). Let me do the math: 3*1093 is 3279, and adding 1 gives 3280. So, 3280 is the result.\n\nMoving another level out, we have 1 + 3*(3280). Calculating that: 3*3280 is 9840, and adding 1 gives 9841. So, that's 9841.\n\nNow, the next expression is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute this: 3*9841 is 29523, and adding 1 gives me 29524. So, 29524 is the result here.\n\nContinuing outward, the next one is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me calculate that: 3*29524 is 88572, and adding 1 gives 88573. So, 88573 is the result.\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3 times that result. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that: 3*88573. Hmm, let me break that down. 80,000 * 3 is 240,000, 8,000 * 3 is 24,000, 500 * 3 is 1,500, 70 * 3 is 210, and 3 * 3 is 9. Adding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 is 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 is 265,500; 265,500 + 210 is 265,710; 265,710 + 9 is 265,719. So, 3*88573 is 265,719.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should compute 88573 * 3 more carefully. \n\nStarting from the right:\n3 * 3 is 9, write down 9.\n3 * 7 is 21, carry over 2, write down 1.\n3 * 5 is 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n3 * 8 is 24, plus the carried 1 is 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n3 * 8 is 24, plus the carried 2 is 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\nWait, but 88573 is a 5-digit number, so after the fifth digit, there are no more digits to multiply, so we just add the carried over 2 at the beginning.\n\nWait, let me do that again more carefully:\n\n88573\ntimes 3\n--------\nStarting from the units place:\n3 * 3 = 9\n3 * 7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2\nNow, since there are no more digits, we write down the carried over 2.\n\nSo, putting it together, starting from the right: 9, 1, 7, 5, 6, and then 2. So, the result is 265719. That matches my earlier calculation, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier computations because sometimes when you have so many layers, it's easy to slip up.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally, 3*(88573) = 265719\n\nEach step seems correct. Let me check a couple of the intermediate steps again.\n\nFor example, step 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. That's correct.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nStep 10: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n\nStep 11: 3*88573 = 265719. Correct.\n\nSo, I think that's accurate. Therefore, the final answer should be 265,719.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Since the expression is a repeated pattern, perhaps there's a formula or a recursive way to compute it without expanding each layer individually.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if I denote each layer as a term, say a_n, where n is the number of layers, then each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nGiven that, we can see that this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem has a fixed number of layers, maybe 9 layers, it's easier to compute each step as I did before.\n\nBut just for fun, let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nLooking at the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and each closing parenthesis closes a layer. Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1+3(...)), so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3)\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" in the expression. Let me parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent (1+3( adds another layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3( ... ))))\n2. The first innermost is (1+3(...))\n3. Each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to note that each time you have a (1+3(...)), it's a new layer. Let's see how many times this occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3(, there are 9 more (1+3(...) before we reach the innermost (1+3). So, perhaps there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nStarting from the outermost:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time we have a (1+3(, that's a new layer. Let's count how many times that happens.\n\n1. 3(1+3( ... ))))\n2. Then, inside that, another (1+3(...)), so that's the second layer.\n3. Continuing, each subsequent ( adds a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of times we have \"1+3(\" in the entire expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each time we have \"1+3(\", that's a new layer.\n\nLet's count them:\n\n1. After the initial 3(, the first \"1+3(\" is the first layer.\n2. Then, inside that, another \"1+3(\" is the second layer.\n3. This continues until we reach the innermost (1+3).\n\nHow many layers is that? Let's see:\n\nFrom the expression, after the initial 3(, there are 9 more layers because each (1+3( adds a new layer, and the innermost is (1+3). So, the total number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but let me check by counting the number of opening parentheses.\n\nThe entire expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( is a new layer. Let's count the number of ( after 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then, inside that, another ( after 1+3: that's the second (\n3. Continuing, each time we have another ( after 1+3: third, fourth, etc.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Therefore, n = 9.\n\nUsing the formula I derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, the innermost layer was (1+3)=4, then each subsequent layer built up to 265,719 at the end. But according to this formula, a_9 is 29524, which is the value before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, so perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Because in the problem, the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result after 9 layers.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The problem is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the value after 9 layers of 1+3*(...). So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier step-by-step calculation where I ended up with 265,719. So, there must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let's go back to the problem and count the number of layers carefully.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3, each time we have \"1+3(\".\n\nSo:\n\n1. 3(1+3( ... ))))\n2. Then inside, another (1+3(...)): that's the second layer.\n3. Continuing until the innermost (1+3).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. After 3(, the first \"1+3(\" is layer 1.\n2. Then inside that, another \"1+3(\" is layer 2.\n3. Continuing, each time we have \"1+3(\", that's another layer.\n\nSo, how many \"1+3(\" are there after the initial 3(?\n\nLet me parse the expression:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( after 1+3 is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of ( after 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then inside, 1+3(, so that's the first layer: 1\n3. Then another ( after 1+3: that's the second layer: 2\n4. Continue until the innermost (1+3).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 9, because each \"1+3(\" adds another (.\n\nWait, let me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then, 1+3( \u2192 that's the first (\n3. Then, another 1+3( \u2192 second (\n4. Continuing until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, from the initial 3(, there are 9 more layers of (1+3(...)). So, total layers n=9.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my earlier step-by-step calculation, I ended up with 265,719, which is 3*(88573). So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( after 1+3 adds a layer. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\n1. After 3(, the first \"1+3(\" is layer 1.\n2. Then, inside that, another \"1+3(\" is layer 2.\n3. Continuing until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many \"1+3(\" are there? Let me count:\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3(, there are 9 more \"1+3(\" instances, each adding a new layer. So, n=9.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, so 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step calculation, I ended up with 265,719, which is 3*88573. So, that suggests that perhaps I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is actually 9, but the way I calculated step-by-step, I went through 10 layers because I started with (1+3) as layer 1, then 1+3*(layer1) as layer2, etc., up to layer10.\n\nWait, that might be the confusion. Let me think.\n\nIn the formula, a_n represents the value after n layers. So, if the problem has 9 layers, then a_9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step calculation, I had:\n\n1. Layer1: (1+3) =4\n2. Layer2: 1+3*4=13\n3.

Layer10:3*29524=88572\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 3*(88573) which was 265,719, which doesn't align with this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step.\n\nWait, let me recount my step-by-step calculations.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) =4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 =13\n3. Next:1 +3*13=40\n4. Next:1 +3*40=121\n5. Next:1 +3*121=364\n6. Next:1 +3*364=1093\n7. Next:1 +3*1093=3280\n8. Next:1 +3*3280=9841\n9. Next:1 +3*9841=29524\n10. Next:3*29524=88572\n\nWait, so that's 10 steps, but according to the formula, n=9 layers, so a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut in my initial problem statement, I thought the final step was 3*88573=265,719, which seems incorrect. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step by miscalculating one of the layers.\n\nWait, let me check the step-by-step calculations again:\n\n1. Layer1: (1+3)=4\n2. Layer2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n3. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n4. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n5. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n6. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n7. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n8. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n9. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n10. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that's 10 steps, but according to the formula, n=9 layers, so a_9=29524, and the total is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nSo, that suggests that my initial step-by-step calculation was incorrect because I thought the final step was 3*(88573), which was wrong. It should be 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went up to 3*(88573)=265,719, which is incorrect. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(:\n\n1. After 3(, the first \"1+3(\" is layer1.\n2. Then, inside that, another \"1+3(\" is layer2.\n3. Continuing until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many \"1+3(\" are there after the initial 3(?\n\nLet me parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the first ( after 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\n1. 3(1+3( \u2192 layer1\n2. Then, inside that, another (1+3( \u2192 layer2\n3. Continuing until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, from the initial 3(, there are 9 more \"1+3(\" instances, making a total of 10 layers. Wait, but that can't be because the formula suggests n=9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the initial 3( counts as a layer or not. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the formula, a_n represents the value after n layers of 1+3*(...). So, if the problem has 9 layers, then a_9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I had 10 layers, which suggests that perhaps the problem has 9 layers, and the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 layers inside, right? So, the total number of layers inside the initial 3*( is 9, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, the formula gives a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I thought that the innermost was layer1, then each subsequent was layer2, up to layer10, which would be incorrect. So, I must have miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the initial 3*(... is the first layer, and then each subsequent (1+3*(... is another layer. So, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 layers inside, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. Layer1: (1+3)=4\n2. Layer2:1+3*4=13\n3. Layer3:1+3*13=40\n4. Layer4:1+3*40=121\n5. Layer5:1+3*121=364\n6. Layer6:1+3*364=1093\n7. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280\n8. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841\n9. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524\n10. Then, the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside the initial 3*(, and then the final multiplication by 3. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572, not 265,719 as I initially thought. So, where did I go wrong earlier? It seems that in my initial step-by-step, I continued one layer too far, perhaps, or miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers carefully.\n\nProblem expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(:\n\n1. After 3(, the first \"1+3(\" is layer1.\n2. Then, inside that, another \"1+3(\" is layer2.\n3. Continuing until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many \"1+3(\" are there? Let's count:\n\nFrom the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" instances after the initial 3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3( \u2192 layer1\n2. Then, inside that, another (1+3( \u2192 layer2\n3. Then, another (1+3( \u2192 layer3\n4. Continue until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers is that? Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(:\n\n- After 3(, there are 9 \"1+3(\" instances, each adding a new layer. So, n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 3*(88573)=265,719, which is incorrect because I must have miscounted the layers. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with the step-by-step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer1: (1+3)=4\n2. Layer2:1+3*4=13\n3. Layer3:1+3*13=40\n4. Layer4:1+3*40=121\n5. Layer5:1+3*121=364\n6. Layer6:1+3*364=1093\n7. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280\n8. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841\n9. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524\n10. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 10 layers, but that was a mistake. It's actually 9 layers inside the initial 3*(, so the final result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). By working from the innermost parentheses outward and using a formula for the nth term of such a recurrence, we find the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). The innermost layer is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer1: 4\n   - Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the final multiplication**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer9, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, maybe I can start from the very inside and work my way out. Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. So, perhaps each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). \n\nLet me try to represent each layer step by step. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. \n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 is 4. \n\nThen, L2 would be 1 + 3*(L1). So, 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. \n\nNext, L3: 1 + 3*(L2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. \n\nMoving on to L4: 1 + 3*(L3). That's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. \n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4). So, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. \n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5). That would be 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900+192 is 1092. Then, 1092 +1 is 1093. \n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6). So, 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. \n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7). That's 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. \n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8). So, 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. \n\nWait a second, so L9 is 29524. But the original expression is 3*(L9). So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. \n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572. \n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. \n\nStarting from the inside:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute this again step by step. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nFirst, 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. So, yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572. \n\nI think that's it. Each step built upon the previous one, and by carefully computing each layer, I arrived at the final answer. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (L1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Next Layer (L2):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Next Layer (L3):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Next Layer (L4):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Next Layer (L5):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Next Layer (L6):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Next Layer (L7):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Next Layer (L8):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Outermost Layer (L9):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:  \n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. \n\nInnermost part: (1 + 3) = 4. \n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that part simplifies to 13.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm keeping track correctly. So, each time I go out a level, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, adding 1, and then that becomes the next part. Let me try to represent this step by step.\n\nLet me number each level from the inside out as Level 1 to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3. So, starting with Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, after computing Level 9, which is the outermost parentheses, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is:\n\n3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 times 3. Well, 29,524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the levels. Let me go back and verify each level.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400, +120=29,520, +3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nNow, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute this again to be sure.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't miss any steps, let me recount the levels. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I worked out each level correctly up to Level 9, and then multiplied by the outermost 3. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula that can simplify the computation without having to calculate each level manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3*C = 1\n-2*C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3*A - 1/2\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n4 + 1/2 = 3*A\n9/2 = 3*A\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWe can write this as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the initial values:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works for the first few terms, so I can trust it.\n\nNow, since our problem goes up to Level 9, that is, n=9, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as I got earlier. So, that confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 - 1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Innermost part: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n3. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n4. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n5. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n6. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n7. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n8. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n9. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\].\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me write this out to visualize it better. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3). Then, moving outward, each time it's 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner expression. So, if I can compute each innermost expression first and then substitute those values back into the outer expressions, I should be able to work my way up to the final answer. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That's simple enough. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, I can replace the innermost (1 + 3) with 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(...)). But wait, inside that, there was another (1 + 3). Let me make sure I'm replacing correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I should label each level so I don't get confused. Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost as levels 1 through 9, since each opening parenthesis seems to have a corresponding closing one, making 9 levels in total. So, level 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), and level 9 is the outermost one. Let me try this approach.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*(Level 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*(Level 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: (1 + 3*(Level 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: (1 + 3*(Level 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: (1 + 3*(Level 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: (1 + 3*(Level 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: (1 + 3*(Level 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: (1 + 3*(Level 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3 times that outermost parentheses. So, after computing Level 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that. So, 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 is 60000, 9000 * 3 is 27000, 500 * 3 is 1500, 20 * 3 is 60, and 4 * 3 is 12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit.\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. But let me double-check my calculations for each level to make sure I didn't make an error earlier.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that all checks out.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this problem is to recognize that each level is a geometric series. Let me think about that. Let me denote each level as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nFrom the way the expression is structured, each level Ln = 1 + 3*Ln+1, but actually, since we're starting from the innermost, it's Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, where Ln is the nth level from the outside. Wait, maybe I should think of it as a recurrence relation.\n\nWait, let's see. Let me define L1 as the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThis seems to be a pattern where each level is defined by Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1.\n\nWait, so if I can find a general formula for Ln, that might help me compute it more efficiently without having to compute each level step by step, especially if the expression were longer. But in this case, since it's only 9 levels, step-by-step is manageable.\n\nBut just for my understanding, let's see if there's a pattern or a formula here.\n\nLooking at the values:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 13\n\nL3 = 40\n\nL4 = 121\n\nL5 = 364\n\nL6 = 1093\n\nL7 = 3280\n\nL8 = 9841\n\nL9 = 29524\n\nHmm, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term minus something. Let me check:\n\nFrom L1 to L2: 3*4 = 12, then 12 +1 =13. So, yes, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is known. It's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence, and the solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is Ln - 3Ln-1 = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Ln^p = C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C =1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n =1, L1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula against the known values.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for level n, Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the outermost level is L9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, as we calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nThis method is more efficient, especially for larger expressions, as it avoids computing each level step by step. But since the problem only had 9 levels, both methods work.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me try computing one more level using the formula and compare with the step-by-step.\n\nLet's take n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Which matches our earlier computation. Good.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and compute each level from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe problem is: Compute \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\).\n\nWe break down the computation level by level, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Level 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Level 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Level 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Level 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Level 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Level 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Level 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Level 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Level 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times the result of the outermost parentheses (Level 9):\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

This pattern continues, with each level adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, until we reach the outermost parentheses.\n\nSo, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside and moving outward. Let me assign each layer a number to keep track. Let's say Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost because I count nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me check that. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3... parts.

So, that means there are nine layers, starting from the innermost (1+3) up to the outermost 3*(...). So, I need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost and moving outward.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nThen, Layer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, each layer is actually 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then, moving outward, Layer 2 would be 3*(1 + Layer 1). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should represent each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, up to L9, which would be the outermost expression.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(...), so actually, the outermost layer is 3 times (L9). Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression correctly. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + something). Let's count how many layers of 3*(1 + ...) there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost (1 + ...). So, if Layer 9 is 3*(1 + ...), then the entire expression would be 3*(Layer 9). But wait, that can't be because in the way I defined Layers 1 to 9, Layer 9 is already the outermost 3*(1 + ...). So, maybe I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is (1 + 3*(Layer 8)), and so on. Let me try to re-express this.\n\nLet me denote each level as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define L1 as the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nWait, that's different from before. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused because of the way the parentheses are structured. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to work from the inside out, computing each set of parentheses step by step.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nFirst, compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result from previous step)).\n\nSo, let's compute each step:\n\nStep 1: Compute innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: Next layer out is (1 + 3*(4)) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Next layer is (1 + 3*(13)) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: Next layer is (1 + 3*(40)) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: Next layer is (1 + 3*(121)) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: Next layer is (1 + 3*(364)) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: Next layer is (1 + 3*(1093)) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: Next layer is (1 + 3*(3280)) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: Next layer is (1 + 3*(9841)) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this outermost result, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...), where ... is the entire nested expression.\n\nSo, after computing the innermost parentheses up to the outermost, which we found to be 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7        3\n----------\n(4\u00d73)=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I was computing the layers, I ended up with 29,524 as the outermost (1 + 3*...), so multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. That's step 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent step adds another layer, so step 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\nStep 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\nStep 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n\nStep 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n\nStep 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093.\n\nStep 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280.\n\nStep 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841.\n\nStep 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers I actually have. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3... parts. Each time, after the first 3, it's (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)). Then, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), starting from the innermost. So, that would mean that after computing up to the 9th layer, which is (1 + 3*(...)), the result is 29,524, and then we multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3 * [ (1 + 3 * [ (1 + 3 * [ ... ] ) ] ) ]\n\nEach [...] represents a nested expression.\n\nSo, the number of nested 3*(1 + ...) expressions is 8, because starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...), and there are 8 such layers before the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me try to count the number of 3*(1 + ...) instances.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nEach time, we add another 3*(1 + ...) layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 3*(1 + ...) starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) instances:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost expression.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3*(1 + ...) by looking at the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the initial 3 starts a new 3*(1 + ...) layer.\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. After the initial 3, the first ( is the start of the first 3*(1 + ...).\n2. Then, each subsequent ( starts another layer.\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses are there after the initial 3?\n\nLet me count:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting after the initial 3, each ( is a new layer.\n\nSo, positions:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3(...\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, which suggests 9 layers. But that can't be right because the innermost is (1+3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me try to count the number of 3*(1 + ...) expressions.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8 because the innermost is (1+3), and then each 3*(1 + ...) adds a layer. Let me try to list them:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that would be 3*36084 = 108,252. But that contradicts my earlier calculation where I ended up with 88,572. Hmm, I must be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nLet me start by computing each nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call this L1.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is (1 + 3*L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this L2.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L3.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L4.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L5.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L6.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L7.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L8.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. L9.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing up to L9 as 29,524, and then multiplying by 3, I got 88,572. However, when I tried to compute each layer up to L9 as 3*(1 + ...), I got 36084, which led me to 108,252 when multiplied by 3. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the layers. Let me clarify the structure of the expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3 * [ (1 + 3 * [ (1 + 3 * [ (1 + 3 * [ ... ]) ]) ]) ]\n\nEach [...] represents a nested expression.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nCompute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is (1 + 3*(previous result)).\n\nSo, the layers are:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried to compute up to L9 as 3*(1 + ...), I thought I had 36084, but that must have been a miscalculation. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me list them again:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify this result using a different approach to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAnother approach could be to recognize that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Let's denote the value at each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a pattern or formula for a_n, but given that there are only 9 layers, it's probably faster to compute each step manually.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer is following the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me compute a few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nNow, let's see if a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, which is not equal to a_1=4. So, that formula doesn't hold.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a different formula. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I have:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous result). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Expression:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me count how many layers there are. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times another expression, so each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. \n\nWait, maybe it's better to work from the inside out. Let me start at the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. \n\nLet me try to evaluate it step by step. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, since I can see there are 9 layers of nested parentheses. \n\nStarting with the innermost layer, which is L1: \n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \n\nThen, moving outward to L2: \n\nL2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \n\nNext, L3: \n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yeah, that's correct. \n\nMoving on to L4: \n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \n\nHmm, that's getting big quickly. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. \n\nProceeding to L5: \n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \n\nWhoa, that's a jump. Let me check: 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Yep, that's right. \n\nNext, L6: \n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \n\nThat's a huge number. Let me confirm: 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. \n\nMoving on to L7: \n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \n\nWait, 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. That seems correct. \n\nNext, L8: \n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \n\nOkay, 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. That's correct. \n\nFinally, the outermost layer, L9: \n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. 3 times 9841: 9841 times 3. Let me compute that: 9841 * 3. \n\n9000 * 3 = 27000, 800 * 3 = 2400, 40 * 3 = 120, 1 * 3 = 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, L9 is 29524. \n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times (L9). So, the entire expression is 3*(L9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. \n\n3 times 29524: Let's break it down. 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. \n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Let me compute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 times 29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. \n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)), so each time, there's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each with their own (1 + 3(...)). So, I think I correctly evaluated each layer from L1 to L9, each time substituting the inner result into the outer expression. \n\nSo, L1 was (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2 was 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. Each time I have 3 times (1 + 3 times something), so each layer is one more 3 times. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3. Wait, no, each layer is a new 3 times. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times ... )))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, 9 layers in total, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, yes, 9 layers, so I think I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me see.\n\nGiven that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, 3^10=59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, using the formula for a geometric series, but it's a bit more complicated because each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum, but I think the recursive approach is more straightforward here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, so each time, it's tripling the previous term and adding 1. So, after 9 layers, it's a_9, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\). Each subsequent layer is calculated as \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_{n-1} \\).\n\n1. \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then calculated as \\( 3 \\cdot a_9 \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next part is 1 plus 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since we've found the innermost result is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first, which is 39, and then add 1: 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40. \n\nContinuing this process, the next layer is 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, and then 1 + 120 is 121. So, now we have 121. \n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate 3*121 first. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives us 364. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. I can break that down: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives us 1093. \n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. I can think of it as 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, and 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives us 3280. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives us 9841. \n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, and 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. \n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*29524. Let me calculate 3*29524. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, and 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives us 88573. \n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 times this result. So, we have 3*88573. Let me compute that. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, and 3*3=9. Adding these together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. \n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 88573 multiplied by 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n\n3 * 8 = 24, plus 1 is 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n\n3 * 8 = 24, plus 2 is 26, write down 6, carry over 2\n\nBut wait, since it's 88573, the digits are 8,8,5,7,3. So, starting from the right:\n\n3*3=9\n\n3*7=21, write 1, carry 2\n\n3*5=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1\n\n3*8=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2\n\n3*8=24 +2=26, write 6, carry 2\n\nBut wait, we've reached the end, so we have a carryover of 2, which we write as 2. So, the result is 265719. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I added the parts earlier, I got 240000 + 24000 + 1500 + 210 + 9, which is 265719. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer simplifies as follows:\n\n1+3 = 4\n\n1+3*4 = 13\n\n1+3*13 = 40\n\n1+3*40 = 121\n\n1+3*121 = 364\n\n1+3*364 = 1093\n\n1+3*1093 = 3280\n\n1+3*3280 = 9841\n\n1+3*9841 = 29524\n\n1+3*29524 = 88573\n\nFinally, 3*88573 = 265719\n\nWait, but let me count the number of layers to make sure I didn't miss any. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time I compute a layer, I'm moving outward. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms.\n\nFrom the innermost, each layer is 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. \n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time we have 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until we have 9 layers? Wait, let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Each time, we have a 1+3(...). Let me see: the innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another 1+3(...). So, how many layers?\n\nLooking at the original expression, the number of 1+3(...) terms is 9, because each time you add a layer, you have one more 1+3. So, starting from 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc., up to 9 layers. Wait, let me check:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, which is the first layer.\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the first layer is 1+3, then the second is 1+3*(1+3), third is 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on until we have 9 layers. Wait, but when I computed earlier, I ended up with 9 layers, each time adding a new 1+3(...). So, starting from 1+3, which is layer 1, then layer 2 is 1+3*(layer1), layer3 is 1+3*(layer2), etc., up to layer9, which would be the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had 9 layers of 1+3(...), leading up to 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. But let me confirm the number of layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3, and then each time we wrap it with another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(...) terms:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of 1+3(...), each time adding another layer. Therefore, when I computed up to 88573, that was the 9th layer, and then the outermost 3 multiplies that, giving 265719.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had 9 layers, each time moving outward, and ended up with 88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me recount each step to make sure I didn't skip any layers or make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, hold on! Earlier, I thought Layer 9 was 88573, but now I'm getting 29524. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me write down each step carefully.\n\nLet me start over, this time keeping track of each layer properly.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after L9, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9, which is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524: Let me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n88572\n\nWait, but 29524*3 is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought it was 265719. Clearly, I made a mistake in the earlier step. Wait, no, because in the initial problem, the outermost is 3*(...), and the innermost is L1: 1+3=4, then L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 265719. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many 1+3(...) are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, each time we have another 1+3(...). Let's count:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, L1 to L9, as I computed earlier, leading to L9=29524, then 3*L9=88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed, I went up to 88573, which was L9, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. That must have been a miscalculation in the number of layers. So, perhaps I miscounted earlier, thinking there were 9 layers, but in reality, it's 8 layers, leading to L8=9841, then 3*9841=29523, but that doesn't align with the earlier count.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. The original expression is 3 multiplied by a 9-layer expression. So, the innermost is 1+3, which is L1. Then, each time we wrap it with another 1+3*(...), up to 9 layers. So, L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. So, L9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I went up to 88573, which was the result of 1+3*29524, which would be L10. But the original expression only has 9 layers, so L9 is 29524, and the outermost is 3*L9=88572.\n\nTherefore, my initial mistake was that I thought there were 9 layers after the outermost 3, but actually, the outermost 3 is applied to the 9th layer, which is 29524. Therefore, the correct result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by a different approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...)) can be represented recursively or using geometric series.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, for n=1: a1=4\n\nn=2: a2=1 + 3*4=13\n\nn=3: a3=1 + 3*13=40\n\nn=4: a4=1 + 3*40=121\n\nn=5: a5=1 + 3*121=364\n\nn=6: a6=1 + 3*364=1093\n\nn=7: a7=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nn=8: a8=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nn=9: a9=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nSo, that's consistent with the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 9 layers, leading to 88573, but that must have been a miscalculation. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nBut to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I thought I had 9 layers leading to 88573, which was wrong. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the mistake I made earlier was in the number of layers, thinking there were 9 layers beyond the initial 3, but in reality, the 3 is multiplied by the 9th layer, which is 29524, giving 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nIn this case, k=3, c=1.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since c=1 is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 1\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1=4.\n\nWhen n=1, a1=4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n=9 layers, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step computation, I thought I had 9 layers leading to 88573, but that must have been a miscalculation. So, the correct answer is indeed 88572.\n\nLet me just confirm once more by computing 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. After simplifying each layer, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final computation of the outermost layer. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a geometric series approach, we determine that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated multiple times.\n\n2. **Start from the Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n3. **Compute Each Layer Outward:**\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply by the Outermost 3:**\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, I see that the innermost part is the last (1+3). That's the very first set of parentheses that I can compute. So, let me write that down: \n\nFirst, compute the innermost parentheses:\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the last part of the expression to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next parentheses would be 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm following the order correctly. The expression is 3(1+3(...)), so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times the next expression). Hmm, maybe I should write down each step as I go along to keep track.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression step by step. Since the expression is nested, I'll work from the inside out. Let me label each level for clarity. Let's say the innermost parentheses is level 1, then moving outward, each subsequent parentheses is the next level. So, level 1 is (1+3), level 2 is (1+3*(result from level 1)), level 3 is (1+3*(result from level 2)), and so on, up to level 9 because I count nine sets of parentheses starting from the innermost one.\n\nWait, actually, let me check that. The problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3 times the next expression. Let me count how many levels there are. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new level. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3), so that's level 1.\n2. Then moving out, the next is (1+3*(level 1 result)), that's level 2.\n3. Then level 3 is (1+3*(level 2 result)), and so on.\n\nWait, but how many levels are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, each (1+3( ... )) is a level. Let me count them:\n\n1. The first innermost is (1+3), so that's level 1.\n2. Then, moving out, each (1+3(...) is another level. So, the number of levels is 9, because from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, actually, let me check that. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is level 1. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(level 1), which is level 2. Then, level 3 is 1 + 3*(level 2), and so on, until level 9, which would be the outermost (1 + 3*(level 8)), and then the entire expression is 3*(level 9). So, that's 9 levels. So, I need to compute from level 1 to level 9, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3 times (level 9), so I think that's correct. So, let's compute each level step by step.\n\nLet me start by computing level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so level 1 is 4.\n\nNow, moving to level 2: 1 + 3*(level 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, level 2 is 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(level 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 3 is 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(level 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 4 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(level 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121: Let's compute that. 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363.\n\nSo, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 5 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(level 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nSo, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 6 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(level 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093: Let's compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nSo, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 7 is 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(level 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: Let's compute that. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840.\n\nSo, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 8 is 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(level 8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.\n\nSo, 27000 + 2400 = 29400.\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520.\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nLevel 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(level 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n3*20000 = 60000.\n\n3*9000 = 27000.\n\n3*500 = 1500.\n\n3*24 = 72.\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute this again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 27 + the carry over 2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 29524 is:\n\nDigits: 2 9 5 2 4\n\nSo, 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nNext: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the levels. The problem has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nYes, that's nine levels. So, from level 1 to level 9, each computed correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to compute each level manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous term.\n\nIn general, for such a linear recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, level n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nBut in our case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward, using the recursive relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Each level is calculated step by step, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are 9 such nested terms, starting from the innermost (1+3).\n\n2. **Compute each level**:\n   - Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Level 9: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by writing down the expression to get a clearer picture. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by a big parenthesis. Inside that parenthesis, it's 1 plus 3 multiplied by another parenthesis, which itself contains 1 plus 3 times another parenthesis, and so on. Counting the number of opening parentheses, I think there are nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, maybe I can work from the innermost one and move outwards, calculating each step as I go.\n\nLet me label each part to make it easier. Let's say the innermost part is (1+3). Then the next one is 1 + 3 times that result. Then the next one is 1 + 3 times the previous result, and so on until I get to the outermost one. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That should be straightforward.\n2. Then, the next layer out would be: 1 + 3*(result from step 1).\n3. Then, the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2).\n4. Continue this process until I've worked my way out to the outermost parentheses.\n5. Finally, multiply the result by 3 as per the original expression.\n\nOkay, so let's start with the innermost parentheses.\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3). That's simple, 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 1). Let's compute that.\n\nStep 2: Compute 1 + 3*(4). So, 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nAlright, so the next layer gives us 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 2), which is 1 + 3*13.\n\nStep 3: Compute 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nSo, that layer gives us 40. Next, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 3).\n\nStep 4: Compute 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121.\n\nHmm, so now we're at 121. Next layer out, it's 1 + 3*121.\n\nStep 5: Compute 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364.\n\nAlright, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*364.\n\nStep 6: Compute 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nSo, now we're at 1093. Next layer out, it's 1 + 3*1093.\n\nStep 7: Compute 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, and 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nMoving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*3280.\n\nStep 8: Compute 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, and 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nNow, the next layer out is 1 + 3*9841.\n\nStep 9: Compute 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, and 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nWait a second, but hold on. Let me check the original problem again. It says: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times the pattern (1 + 3(...) ) appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nSo, actually, the innermost is step 1, and then each step up to step 9, right? So, when I did step 9, I got 29524. But then, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by that. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I only went up to step 9, which gave me 29524. So, the entire expression is 3*(result of step 9). So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nStep 10: Compute 3*29524. Let's do this multiplication.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3. Let me compute this step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Let's do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nFinally, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps because 29524 seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the previous steps.\n\nLet me go back and verify each step:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all the steps up to step 9 are correct. Then, step 10: 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct as well.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute 3*9841 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nWait, step 8: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the number of layers correctly because the problem has a lot of parentheses, and sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses inside the main expression.\n\nStarting after the first 3(, the first ( is at position 1, then each subsequent ( increases the count. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me parse this:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n11. )))\n12. )))\n13. )))\n14. )))\n15. )))\n16. )))\n17. )))\n18. )))\n19. )))\n20. ))\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of (1+3(...)) blocks. Each time after a 3(, there's a 1+3(...). So, let's count how many times that occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3), which is the 9th layer from the inside.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of times 1+3( occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3(, there's 1+3(, and then each subsequent ( is another 1+3(.\n\nSo, the number of 1+3( is 9. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, 9 instances of 1+3(, which means 9 layers. So, step 1 to step 9, each layer corresponds to one of these. So, yes, 9 layers, each computed correctly as above.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me verify.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, that's an interesting way to model it. Let's see.\n\nIf I consider a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = 3*a_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm it.\n\nTherefore, I'm absolutely sure that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the inside out:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ (1 + 3) = 4 \\]\n\n2.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. The innermost parentheses are the last one, which is (1+3). That seems simple enough. So, let me write that down: \n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me substitute the innermost part with 4. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) \n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, substituting 13 into that: \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13)\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So, this layer simplifies to 40. \n\nHmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, we're taking the result from the inner layer, multiplying it by 3, adding 1, and that gives us the next layer's value. Let me try to write this down step by step to keep track. \n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I count the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with a 1 and followed by 3 times another expression. So, each time I compute a layer, I'm moving one step outward, and I should do this nine times, right? Let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the ninth layer is the one right before the final multiplication by 3. So, after computing the ninth layer, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. \n\nSo, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. \n\n3 * 29524: Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with large numbers.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n- 29524 * 3\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method to verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, the multiplication is correct.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, and finally multiplying the last result by 3, I arrive at the total of 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't skip any layers, let me recount the layers:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1+3*4) = 13\n3. (1+3*13) = 40\n4. (1+3*40) = 121\n5. (1+3*121) = 364\n6. (1+3*364) = 1093\n7. (1+3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1+3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1+3*9841) = 29524\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, hold on, that's actually ten steps, but the original expression only has nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of parentheses pairs: Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and each \")\" closes it. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is nine. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, there are nine layers inside the initial 3(...). So, when I computed up to (1+3*9841) = 29524, that was the ninth layer, and then I multiplied by 3. So, my earlier count was correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this might be to recognize that each layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is calculated as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula or recognize it as a geometric series.\n\nLet me explore that for a moment. \n\nGiven the recursive formula:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see: starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. From the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting after the first 3(, there are nine \"1+3(\" before the first closing parenthesis. So, that would mean there are nine layers. So, n = 9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recursive formula and solving it as a recurrence relation gives me the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, it would look like:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIf I denote the innermost expression as a base case and work outwards, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, when expanded, the expression would be a sum of terms where each term is 3 raised to a certain power multiplied by 1, but I need to think carefully about how that would work.\n\nLet me try to express the entire expression in terms of a sum.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, if I think about expanding the entire expression without substituting each layer, it would be a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, expanding all layers would give:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\n= 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\n\n= 3 + 9*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))\n\nContinuing this expansion, each time we'd be adding another term. However, this seems complicated, so perhaps the recursive approach is better.\n\nBut, considering that we've already solved it using both step-by-step substitution and the recurrence relation method, and both gave the same result, I can be confident that 88572 is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, the total expression can be seen as a sum where each term is 3^k, but adjusted by the addition of 1 at each step. However, I need to be careful because each addition of 1 is inside a multiplication by 3, which affects the way the series is structured.\n\nWait, actually, using the formula we found earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which for n=9 gives a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524, as before. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression without separating the layers, it's 3 multiplied by a sum that includes terms of 3^1, 3^2, up to 3^9, each multiplied by 1 and then summed up in a particular way. But, honestly, the recursive method seems the most straightforward here.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the expression step by step again, just to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, I can be confident that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write a small program or use a calculator to compute this step by step, I could verify it numerically. But since I don't have a calculator handy, and given that both the step-by-step substitution and the recursive formula approach yield the same result, I can be fairly certain that 88572 is correct.\n\nIn summary, by methodically working from the innermost parentheses outward and applying the operations step by step, and by verifying through a recurrence relation approach, I arrived at the solution of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer simplifies to a value that is used in the next outer layer. By systematically computing each layer and then multiplying the final result by 3, the solution is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, this layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer is:\n\n4. 1 + 3*(result from step 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. That's 121.\n\nNext layer:\n\n5. 1 + 3*(result from step 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Now we're at 364.\n\nMoving out another layer:\n\n6. 1 + 3*(result from step 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364 is... let me calculate that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, step 6 gives me 1093.\n\nNext layer:\n\n7. 1 + 3*(result from step 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCalculating 3*1093. Let's break that down: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, step 7 is 3280.\n\nContinuing outward:\n\n8. 1 + 3*(result from step 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280. Hmm, let's see: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, step 8 is 9841.\n\nNext layer:\n\n9. 1 + 3*(result from step 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCalculating 3*9841. Let me break that down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Step 9 gives me 29524.\n\nFinally, moving to the outermost layer:\n\n10. 1 + 3*(result from step 9) = 1 + 3*29524\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me check the original problem again. The expression is $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. So, after the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). But when I count the layers, I think I might have gone one step too far. Let me recount.\n\nWait, actually, let me count how many layers there are. The expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and inside, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me see how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the original expression: starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), right? Because each time it's 3*(...), and inside that, another 3*(...), and so on, until the ninth layer. So, perhaps I went one step too far in my earlier steps. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in my earlier steps, I had steps 1 through 9, each time moving outward, so perhaps the outermost layer is step 9, which would be 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. So, step 10 would be 3*29524, which is the final answer. But let me confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))). So, each time, after the initial 3*, there's a 1 + 3*, and each of those has another 1 + 3*, etc. Let me count the number of 3* terms inside.\n\nStarting from the first 3*, then each subsequent 3* is inside another. So, let's see: the first is 3*(...), then inside that is another 3*(...), and so on, how many times? Let me count the number of 3*(...) after the first one.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))). So, after the first 3*, there are 8 more 3*s inside. So, that would mean there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost. So, perhaps my initial steps 1 through 9 were correct, and then the final result is 3 multiplied by that, which would be step 10.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, step 9 was 29524, which was the result of 1 + 3*9841. So, that would be the result inside the ninth layer, right? Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, so 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that calculation again because 29524*3: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Because sometimes when you're doing a lot of steps, it's easy to make an error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13.\n\nStep3:1 + 3*13=1+39=40.\n\nStep4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nStep5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nStep6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nStep7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nStep8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nStep9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me verify each step again.\n\nStep1: (1+3)=4. Correct.\n\nStep2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nStep3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nStep4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nStep5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nStep6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nStep7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nStep8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nStep9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, each time, the number of layers is 9. So, perhaps I should count the layers correctly.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3*(...), each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let's count the number of 3*(...) after the first one.\n\nLooking at the structure:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, each layer after the first 3* has another 3*. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\n10. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...), so the first step is to compute the innermost, then each subsequent step adds a layer, so after 9 layers, the result is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))). So, counting the number of 3*(...) after the initial 3*, it's 9 times. So, that would mean that the innermost is (1 + 3), then 8 more layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps my earlier steps were correct, and the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, which would allow me to compute a_9 without computing each step. Let's try that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method is more efficient because it uses the closed-form formula to compute a_9 directly without calculating each a_n step by step. That's a good check on my previous work.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 59048/2 = 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nSo, both methods lead me to the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern that can be modeled with a recurrence relation, we find the value of the expression.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the innermost expression**: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. **Work outward layer by layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nThus, the computed value of the expression is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, let's try to parse this expression. Starting from the innermost part, which is the last 1+3. Let me write down each layer separately to keep track. The innermost part is (1+3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner layer. So, perhaps I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside. Let me write this out step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3). That should be 4.\n2. Next layer out is (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). So, if step 1 was 4, then this would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n3. Moving outward, the next layer would be (1 + 3*(result from step 2)). So that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 3)). So 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n5. Continuing outward: (1 + 3*(result from step 4)). That's 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 5)). So 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n7. Moving outward: (1 + 3*(result from step 6)). That's 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 7)). So 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n9. Finally, the outermost layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 8)). That's 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I did that correctly. Each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Let me go through each step again to verify.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. That seems right.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Yes.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Yep.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That's right.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Yes.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. Finally: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. That seems right.\n\nWait, but hold on. The original problem is 3 times that entire expression. So, after computing the innermost parentheses and working outward, I arrived at 29524 for the innermost expression. But the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, is the final answer 3 times 29524? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, yes, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the big nested parentheses. Therefore, after computing the nested part as 29524, the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n________  \nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.  \n2*3=6 +1=7.  \n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.  \n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.  \n2*3=6 +2=8.  \nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait a second, but hold on. When I computed the nested expression, I ended up with 29524, and then I multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check whether the nested expression was indeed 29524 because that seems like a lot of layers, and I might have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, the original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Each time, there's a 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, so starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", right? Because each time, the expression is 1 + 3 times another expression, and the innermost is just 1 + 3. So, that's 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I did 9 steps, starting from (1+3)=4, then each step multiplying by 3 and adding 1, up to 9 steps, resulting in 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me check if I actually have 9 layers or not.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses: starting from the first 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(...)))\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...))))\n4. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...)))))\n5. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...))))))\n6. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...)))))))\n7. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...))))))))\n8. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...))))))))))\n9. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, actually, the innermost expression is (1+3), and each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), so that's one opening parenthesis.\n2. Inside that, another (1+3(...)), so that's two.\n3. Continuing, each time, another (1+3(...)), so up to how many?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nFrom the expression, starting after the first 3, each layer is 1+3 followed by another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(...))) \u2192 1\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...)))) \u2192 2\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...))))) \u2192 3\n4. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...))))) \u2192 4\n5. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...))))) \u2192 5\n6. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...)))))) \u2192 6\n7. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...))))))) \u2192 7\n8. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...))))))))) \u2192 8\n9. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 9\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of \"1+3(...)\", meaning that when I computed earlier, I correctly went through 9 steps, each time computing the next layer. So, the result of the innermost expression is 4, then each subsequent layer adds a step, up to 9 steps, resulting in 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, so that's 9 layers, resulting in a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, the outermost layer is 3*(...), where the ... is the nested expression. So, yes, the outermost 3 multiplies the entire nested expression, which we've computed as 29524, leading to 88572.\n\nBut wait, another way to approach this is to recognize that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a formula for a_n, which might help verify my earlier computation.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1  \n-2K = 1  \nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2  \n4 = 3C - 1/2  \n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 holds true for each step up to n=9, which confirms that a_9=29524.\n\nTherefore, the nested expression evaluates to 29524, and the entire problem is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication once more because 29524 is a large number and I want to be absolutely sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 digit by digit:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n________  \nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a formula, and double-checking the multiplication, I can confidently say that the result of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the step-by-step computation.\n\nGiven a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nFor n=1 to 9:\n\nn=1: (3^2 -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nAll correct. So, a_9=29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " \n\nLet me try to visualize this. The innermost part is (1+3), right? Then that result is multiplied by 3 and added to 1 in the next layer, and this process repeats until we get to the outermost parentheses. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside. Let me write down the expression step by step to make it clearer.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n2. 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out:\n3. 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer:\n4. 1 + 3*(result from step 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext layer:\n5. 1 + 3*(result from step 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nHmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that gives me the next layer. Let me keep going.\n\n6. 1 + 3*(result from step 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*(result from step 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*(result from step 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. 1 + 3*(result from step 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 times 3. Let me do that step by step: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so that's the result after the 9th layer. Now, going back to the original problem, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result, right? So, the outermost operation is 3*(result from step 9). So, let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding those together:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to miscalculate with such large numbers. Let me verify each step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems like all the steps check out. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that expressions like this, where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or solved using a formula. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the layers, each step is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + d, where d is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find d, we can set a_n = d, so d = 1 + 3*d. Solving for d: d = 1 + 3d \u21d2 -2d = 1 \u21d2 d = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1. a_1 should be 4. Plugging into the formula: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f. Good.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = 13. Using the formula: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=3: a_3=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=4: a_4=121. Formula: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is layer 1.\n\nThen each additional (1+3(...) adds a layer. Let's see:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (1+3(...)): from the innermost, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because the innermost is layer 1, and each additional layer adds one more. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which would be a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step computation, I went up to layer 9, which was 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. That matches my earlier result. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, whether I compute step by step, or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing it as a geometric series or something else. Since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's a linear recurrence relation, as I did before, which is a standard approach for such problems.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider expanding the entire expression, it would be a sum of terms where each term is 3 raised to a certain power, but with coefficients. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 1 + 3^1\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9\n\nWait, that's 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nWait, so each layer adds another term which is 3 raised to the next power. So, in general, after n layers, the expression would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n.\n\nWait, but in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous expression), which is similar to adding another term in the geometric series.\n\nBut wait, let's check with n=1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f, which is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nn=3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nSo, in general, after n layers, the expression is equal to the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, right? Because each layer adds another power of 3.\n\nWait, but the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly the formula I derived earlier. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, the innermost expression is layer 1, which is 1 + 3^1, and each subsequent layer adds another term in the geometric series. So, after 9 layers, we have the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3 gives us 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give me the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and plan to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from (1+3) and moving outward, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\n3. After computing all layers up to the 9th, multiply the final result by 3.\n\n4. Verify the result using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, which confirmed the answer.\n\n5. Alternatively, recognize the pattern as a geometric series and use the sum formula to compute directly, leading to the same result.\n\nSo, all methods converge to the same answer, which gives me confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and plan to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1.

Let me write that as well:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(4). So, 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. Got that. So, now, moving another level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. Let me compute that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(13). 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, so now we're at 40. Let's keep going. The next one out would be 1 + 3*40. Let me calculate that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, that's getting big quickly. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*121. Let me do that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, 364. Next layer is 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wow, that's over a thousand now. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*1093. Let me figure that out:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Hmm, 3280. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3*3280. Let's see:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Wow, that's almost ten thousand. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Okay, 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3 times this result. So, let's compute that:\n\nOutermost: 3*(29524) = 88572. So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, I end up with 88572 as the final result.\n\nWait, let me double-check that because the numbers are getting so large, and I don't want to make a mistake. Maybe I should verify each step again to ensure I didn't miscalculate anywhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n10. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems like all the steps check out. So, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem from another angle or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have simplified the calculation. Let me think.\n\nI notice that each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to express the innermost expression and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLet's define each level as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost expression:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nAnd then the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, each a_n is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each step manually, especially if the expression were longer.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where in this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is known, and it can be expressed as:\n\na_n = (a_1 - d/c) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c)\n\nWait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c)\n\nBut in our case, c = 3 and d = 1. Plugging these in:\n\na_n = (a_1 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3)\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2\n\nSo, a_n = (a_1 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na_n = (a_1 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, plug that in:\n\na_n = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nWhich is:\n\na_n = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nSimplify further:\n\na_n = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nWe can factor out 1/2:\n\na_n = (1/2)*(9*3^{n-1} - 1)\n\nSimplify 9*3^{n-1} as 3^{2}*3^{n-1} = 3^{n+1}\n\nSo, a_n = (1/2)*(3^{n+1} - 1)\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I calculated earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4:\n\na_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula seems to work. So, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers of nesting, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I also arrive at the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))\n\nIf I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to 9 layers. Wait, but in our problem, the expression isn't recursive in the same way because each layer is only one level deeper. So, maybe that approach isn't directly applicable here.\n\nBut, since I already have the closed-form formula, I can rely on that to compute the result without manually computing each layer, which is especially useful if the number of layers increases.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same final answer of 88572. So, I feel confident that this is the correct solution.\n\nJust to recap, here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result)\n3. After computing all 9 layers, the result is 29524\n4. Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, the problem is solved, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves calculating 1 plus three times the result of the next inner expression. By systematically working through each layer, the final result is determined to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost parentheses evaluate to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since we just found the innermost result is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level out evaluates to 13. \n\nAlright, moving another level out, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next level is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern forming here. Let me keep track of each level as I go outward because I don't want to get lost in the nesting. \n\nSo, let's list out the results as we go from the innermost to the outermost parentheses. Starting with the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost expression: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me double-check how many levels there are because I might have miscounted. The original expression is $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. Let me count the number of 3(1+3... parts. \n\nStarting from the left, the first term is 3 times (1 + 3(...)). Then inside that, another 3 times (1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a nested level. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3(1+3(...) adds another level. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n\nSo, there are 9 nested levels after the initial 3. Wait, but in my earlier count, I went up to level 10, which would be the outermost expression. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me clarify. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3, which is 4, then 1+3*4=13, and so on. Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions. Each 1+3 is a separate level. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then moving out, each (1+3(...)) adds another level. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1+3*4) = 13\n3. (1+3*13) = 40\n4. (1+3*40) = 121\n5. (1+3*121) = 364\n6. (1+3*364) = 1093\n7. (1+3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1+3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1+3*9841) = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, so that's 10 steps, but the initial expression is 3 times the first level, which is 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps I have 9 nested expressions inside the initial 3. Let me try to parse it again.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nSo, each *3 is a multiplication outside a parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving outward, each time it's (1 + 3*(...)). So, the number of times we have (1 + 3*(...)) is 9, and then the outermost is 3*(...). So, perhaps my initial count was correct with 9 nested (1 + 3*(...)) expressions, and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but when I started counting, I had 10 steps, including the final multiplication by 3. Maybe I should separate the process into two parts: evaluating all the nested (1 + 3*(...)) expressions, and then multiplying the final result by 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to work from the inside out, step by step, as I did earlier, and just keep track of each result as I move outward.\n\nSo, let me try that approach again, but this time, I'll make sure to count correctly.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have:\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext level out:\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext level:\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext level:\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext level:\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext level:\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext level:\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext level:\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, we've evaluated all the nested parentheses, and the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is:\n\n10. 3*29524 = ?\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524. To do this, I can break it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\nFirst, multiply 29,524 by 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n?\n\nLet's compute this digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, that gives 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, but let me make sure that I didn't miss any levels. Let me recount the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each step builds upon the previous one, working from the inside out, and the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without manually stepping through each level. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the nested structure, each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, and perhaps we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 \u2192 -2*C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many levels do we have? Let's see.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3) as level 1: a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent level is built upon the previous one. So, the outermost expression is level 9, because the original expression has 9 nested (1 + 3(...)) expressions, right? Let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (1+3(...)) parts: starting from the innermost, each subsequent one adds another layer. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each 3*(...) adds another layer. So, the number of nested (1+3) expressions is 9, which means n=9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 9 steps after the innermost, leading up to a_9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3. So, perhaps in the formula, n=9 would give a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Yes, that matches the a_9 value I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value before the final multiplication by 3 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88,572, as I calculated before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrived at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, if I expand the expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I denote the entire expression inside the first parentheses as S, then S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). But this seems a bit circular, so maybe expanding it would help.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can express the entire nested expression as a sum. Let me see.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n...\n\nLevel 9: a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nAnd the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we found earlier, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula without going through each step, which would be more efficient, especially if the number of levels were larger. But in this case, since there are only 9 levels, it's manageable to compute step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute it using the formula to see if I get the same result.\n\nGiven a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the level number. So, for level 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, 3^10 is 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's the same result as before. Therefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula\u2014we arrive at the same answer.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this, so I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level involves calculating 1 plus 3 times the result of the next level. Using a step-by-step approach or recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation leads to the same result.\n\nStep-by-step evaluation:\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Final: 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from the innermost part:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, if I start from the inside, the innermost expression is just 1 + 3, right? Because that's the last part before the parentheses start closing. Let me confirm that. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is indeed 1 + 3. So, let's compute that first.\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have another 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the previous result was 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so now we have 13 as the result for that layer. Let's move out another layer. The next expression is 1 + 3*(13). So, 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nSo, the next result is 40. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*40. Let's compute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nHmm, 121. That's interesting. Let me check my calculations so far. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, then 1+3*40=121. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate that. 3*121 is... let me do that step by step. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so adding them up: 300+60=360, plus 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me verify. 121*3 is indeed 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that. First, 3*364. Let's break it down: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nHmm, 1093. That's a big number. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Yes, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1092 +1=1093. Correct.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute that. 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, 1093*3 is indeed 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate that. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, adding them up: 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9841. That's a large number, but let's confirm. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240=9840. Then 9840+1=9841. Correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute that. 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120=29520, plus 3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, moving out to the outermost layer, we have 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, let me confirm. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Then, 88572 +1=88573. Correct.\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3 times that result. So, the entire original expression is 3*(88573). Let me compute that. 88573*3. Let's break it down:\n\n80000*3=240000,\n8000*3=24000,\n500*3=1500,\n70*3=210,\n3*3=9.\n\nAdding them up: 240000 +24000=264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719.\n\nSo, 88573*3=265719.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 88573*3:\n\n3*3=9, write down 9.\n3*7=21, carryover 2, write down 1.\n3*5=15, plus 2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n3*8=24, plus 1=25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n3*8=24, plus 2=26, write down 6, carryover 2.\nWait, but there's no digit beyond the 8, so the carryover 2 would be added as 200000. Wait, let me do it properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should do it digit by digit:\n\n3*3 = 9. So, units place: 9.\n\n3*7=21. Write down 1, carryover 2.\n\n3*5=15 + 2=17. Write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n3*8=24 + 1=25. Write down 5, carryover 2.\n\n3*8=24 + 2=26. Write down 6, carryover 2.\n\nBut there are no more digits, so the carryover 2 becomes 200000.\n\nWait, so the result is 265719. Let me add it up: 265719.\n\nWait, but when I did the initial breakdown, I had 240000 +24000=264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719. So, that matches.\n\nSo, 88573*3=265719. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 265719.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or count incorrectly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\n11. 3*88573 = 265719\n\nWait, but the original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each \"1+3(\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let's see:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a layer. Starting from the innermost, there are nine \"1+3(\" before the final \"1+3)\". Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1+3( occurs. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 1+3( is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))... So, the first layer is 1+3(...).\n\nThen, each time it repeats. Let me count how many times 1+3( occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, from the first 3(, then inside it's 1+3(...), which is the first layer. Then inside that, another 1+3(...), which is the second layer, and so on until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see: each time we have 1+3(, that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n... and so on until we reach the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 1+3( before the final 1+3). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3( appears before the last 1+3).\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, each time adding another 1+3(...). So, when I computed up to 88573, that was the 10th step, but perhaps I have an extra step because I started counting from 1. Let me see.\n\nWait, no. Each time I computed a layer, I moved out one step. So, if there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(...), then the total number of computations would be 9 steps, right?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4\n\n2. Next layer: 1+3*4=13\n\n3. Next: 1+3*13=40\n\n4. Next: 1+3*40=121\n\n5. Next: 1+3*121=364\n\n6. Next: 1+3*364=1093\n\n7. Next: 1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. Next: 1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. Next: 1+3*9841=29524\n\n10. Next: 1+3*29524=88573\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers, but the original expression only has 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many 1+3( are there? Let me count each occurrence:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, no parentheses after.\n\nThen, moving out, each time it's 1+3( followed by another expression. Let me count the number of 1+3( before the final ).\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, from the first 3(, the first 1+3( is the first layer, then another 1+3(, and so on until the last 1+3(...))).\n\nSo, how many 1+3( are there? Let's see:\n\nFrom the first 3(, the next is 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on until the last one before the final )))))))).\n\nSo, let's count the number of 1+3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n\n2. 1+3(1+3(...\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(...\n\n... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(:\n\n- The first 3( is followed by 1+3(\n\n- Then another 1+3(\n\n- And so on until the last one.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the first 3(, the next is 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on. Let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, each subsequent 1+3( is a new layer. So, the number of 1+3( after the initial 3( is 9 times, because the innermost is 1+3, which is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, the initial expression is 3 times (something with 9 layers). Therefore, when I computed up to 88573, that was the result of the innermost 9 layers, and then I multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went through 10 layers, which might be incorrect. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the initial 3( is the first layer, and then each 1+3( is a subsequent layer. So, if there are 9 1+3( inside the initial 3(...), then we have 9 layers inside, each adding another 1+3(...). Therefore, the total number of layers is 9.\n\nSo, let me recount, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, that's 10 layers, but according to the expression, it's only 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 3( is the first layer, and then each 1+3( adds a new layer. So, the initial 3( is layer 1, then each 1+3( is layers 2 through 10. But that can't be right because the expression only has 9 layers inside.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Let me write the expression with indices to see how many layers there are.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., Ln, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out:\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nL10: 1 + 3*L9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers, but according to the expression, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, each time we have a 1+3(, which adds a new layer. Let's count the number of 1+3( before the final )))))))).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many times does 1+3( occur?\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, no parentheses after.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have 1+3(.\n\nSo, from the innermost, the first is 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3(1+3), then the next is 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on until the outermost layer, which is 3(1+3(...)).\n\nSo, how many times does 1+3( occur? Let me count:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers where each has one more 1+3( than the previous. So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had 10 layers. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me try to recount.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the initial 3( is not counted as a layer, but rather each 1+3( is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, 1+3 is the first layer, then each time we go out, we add another 1+3(, making 9 layers in total.\n\nSo, let me recount:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, resulting in 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so 3*29524.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 10 layers, ending at 88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me check the expression again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, the initial 3( is followed by 1+3(...). So, the expression is 3*(...), where the ... is 1+3*(...), and so on.\n\nSo, the number of layers inside the initial 3*(...) is 9, because after 3*(, there are 9 instances of 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3( after the initial 3*(:\n\n1. 3*(1+3*(...\n\n2. 1+3*(1+3*(...\n\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(...\n\n... up to the 9th layer.\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 9, and then each time moving out, we add another 1+3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the initial 3*(...) is the outermost layer, and inside it, there are 9 layers of 1+3*(...). So, the first layer after 3*( is 1+3*(...), which is layer 1, then inside that, another layer, up to layer 9.\n\nSo, in that case, the total number of layers inside the initial 3*(...) is 9, meaning that when I compute from the innermost, I should compute 9 layers, and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had 10 layers, which included the initial 3*(...). So, perhaps I made a mistake by including the initial 3*(...) as a layer, when actually, it's just the multiplication by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, let me try this again, carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3*(...) is the outermost layer. Inside that, we have 1 + 3*(...), which is the first inner layer. Then, inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on, until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many times does 1 + 3*( occur inside the initial 3*(...)? Let's count:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\n... and so on until the innermost.\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the 9th layer inside the initial 3*(...). Therefore, we have 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...), each being 1 + 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, to compute this, we need to compute 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost, and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nSo, let's compute the innermost 9 layers:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after computing 9 layers, we get 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572\n\nThen, 88572 + 0 (since we're just multiplying by 3, not adding 1) because the outermost expression is 3*(...), not 1 + 3*(...). Wait, hold on! I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I included the outermost 3*(...) as a separate layer, but actually, the outermost expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the result of the 9 layers inside. So, after computing the 9 layers, we have a value, say V, and then the entire expression is 3*V.\n\nBut in my earlier computation, I treated the outermost 3*(...) as another layer, which it's not. It's just a multiplication by 3 after computing the inner 9 layers.\n\nWait, so let me correct that. After computing the 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier result because I mistakenly included an extra layer.\n\nWait, let me recount. If the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ... ))), then the 9 layers inside result in 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed 10 layers, ending at 88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265719, that was incorrect because I included an extra layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the layers. Let me try again.\n\nLet me structure this properly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3*(...) is the outermost layer. Inside that, we have 1 + 3*(...), which is the first inner layer. Then, each time we have another 1 + 3*(...), until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, the number of 1 + 3*( layers is 9, starting from the first inner layer up to the 9th innermost layer.\n\nTherefore, the computation should be:\n\nCompute the innermost 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n\nThen, moving out, compute each 1 + 3*(previous result):\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial computation. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by including an extra layer.\n\nWait, let me confirm by counting the number of 1 + 3*( layers inside the initial 3*(...). Let me write the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, yes, that's 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...), resulting in Layer 9 = 29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial computation, I had 10 layers, which included the outermost 3*(...), which is not correct because the outermost is just a multiplication by 3, not another 1 + 3*(...). Therefore, the correct result should be 88572, not 265719.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this because I'm getting conflicting results.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the expression step by step.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3*( inside the initial 3*(...):\n\n- The first 3*( is followed by 1 + 3*(\n\n- Then another 1 + 3*(\n\n- And so on until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many 1 + 3*( are there? Let's see:\n\nFrom the first 3*(, the next is 1 + 3*(, then another 1 + 3*(, and so on"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. The very last part before all the closing parentheses start is 1+3. So, I think I should compute that first. Let me write that down: 1 + 3. Hmm, that's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression would be 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, looking at the structure, each time it's 1 plus 3 times the next inner expression. So, the innermost is 1+3, which is 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(inner result). So, let's compute that.\n\nSo, after the innermost 1+3 is 4, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer becomes 40. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm following the structure correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... and so on. So, each time, the outer 3 multiplies the result of the inner expression. But I think I'm on the right track because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me keep going. \n\nSo, after 40, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that's 121. Then, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, that's 364. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that's 1093. Then, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(1093). Let's calculate that: 3*1093 is 3279, and 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280. \n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute that: 3*3280 is 9840, and 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that's 9841. Then, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(9841). Hmm, 3*9841 is... let's see, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, that's 29524. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives us 88573. So, that's 88573. \n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 3*29524 should be correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, adding 1 gives 88573. \n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute that: 3*88573. Let's break it down: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives us 265720. So, that's 265720. \n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the entire expression is 3*(265720). Let me compute that: 3*265720. Let's break it down: 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, 3*265720 is 797160. \n\nWait a second, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. 265720 * 3: \n\n265,720\n\u00d7        3\n----------\n797,160\n\nYes, that's correct because 200,000*3=600,000; 60,000*3=180,000; 5,000*3=15,000; 700*3=2,100; 20*3=60. Adding those gives 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000; 780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000; 795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100; 797,100 + 60 = 797,160. So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 797,160. \n\nWait, but let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes because it's easy to miscalculate with such large numbers. Let me recount each step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720\n12. Finally: 3*265,720 = 797,160\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, and the calculations look correct. I don't see any errors in my computations, so I think the final result is indeed 797,160. \n\nI guess another way to look at this problem is to recognize that it's a geometric series or some kind of recursive structure. But since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's more of a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if there's a formula for such a sequence.\n\nIf I let a_n be the nth term, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with the innermost term a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built using this relation. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = A*r^{n} + (c/(1 - r)), where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. So, the general solution would be a_n = A*3^{n} + (1/(1 - 3)) = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2, and A = 3/2, then a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's see how many layers we have in the original problem. The innermost is a_1, then a_2, up to a_9 because the original expression has nine layers of nesting. So, n=9. Let me compute a_9 using the formula.\n\na_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Wait, that's the same as what I got when I computed up to the 11th step earlier, which was 265720. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(a_9). Because the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the 9th term. So, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, that's different from what I calculated earlier. Wait, that can't be right because earlier, after computing a_9 as 29524, I went on to compute a_10 as 88573, then a_11 as 265720, and finally 3*a_11 as 797160. But according to the formula, a_9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572, which is much less than what I computed before. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let's recount the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1+3, that's the first layer, then each subsequent 1+3*(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1)\n3. 1 + 3*(2)\n...\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Each time, it's one more layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(1)\n3. 1+3*(2)\n4. 1+3*(3)\n5. 1+3*(4)\n6. 1+3*(5)\n7. 1+3*(6)\n8. 1+3*(7)\n9. 1+3*(8)\n10. 1+3*(9)\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers after the initial 3. So, the outermost is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th term. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = 29524. Therefore, 3*29524 = 88572. But that contradicts my earlier step-by-step calculation where I ended up with 797,160. So, clearly, I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances. Each time I see \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nEach time, it's one more layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. Let's count them:\n\n- The first \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3 is layer 1.\n- Then another \"1 + 3(\" is layer 2.\n- Continuing, we have layers 1 through 9, because after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(\".\n\nWait, but when I expand it, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer, so the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. Therefore, the total number of layers is 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th term. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my earlier step-by-step calculation, I ended up with 797,160, which is much larger. So, where did I go wrong? Let me check my earlier steps again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me write out the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nThen, the outermost is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to layer 11, which would imply 11 layers, but according to the formula, there are only 9 layers. So, I must have miscounted the layers in the original expression.\n\nWait, let me look at the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- After the initial 3, the first \"1 + 3(\" is layer 1.\n- Then, inside that, another \"1 + 3(\" is layer 2.\n- Continuing, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" appear?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. After 3( comes the first \"1 + 3(\", so that's layer 1.\n2. Then, inside that, another \"1 + 3(\", layer 2.\n3. Continuing, each time we have a \"(\", it's a new layer.\n\nWait, actually, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let me count:\n\n- The expression starts with 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first \"1 + 3(\" is at the first layer, then each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" is a deeper layer. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances:\n\n1. 1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n10. 1 + 3\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Each \"1 + 3(\" is followed by another layer, but the innermost is 1 + 3, which doesn't have another \"1 + 3(\" after it. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears, which is 9 times. Therefore, there are 9 layers, with the innermost being layer 9. Therefore, the total expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I went up to a_11, which would imply 11 layers, but according to the structure, there are only 9 layers. So, I must have miscounted. Let me recount the layers carefully.\n\nLet me write the expression with each layer labeled:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer9)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer7)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer6)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer5)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer4)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\nOutermost: 3*(Layer1)\n\nWait, that can't be right because the outermost is 3*(Layer1), which is layer 1. So, perhaps the labeling is from the inside out. Let me try again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, there are 9 layers, and the outermost is 3*(Layer9). Therefore, the correct answer is 88572, not 797,160 as I initially thought. So, where did I go wrong earlier? I think I miscounted the layers, thinking there were 11 layers instead of 9. That's why my initial step-by-step went up to 265,720, which is a_11, but in reality, the expression only has 9 layers, so a_9 is 29524, and the total is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3, that's layer 1. Then, each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...3(1 + 3(...\n3. ...3(1 + 3(...\n4. ...3(1 + 3(...\n5. ...3(1 + 3(...\n6. ...3(1 + 3(...\n7. ...3(1 + 3(...\n8. ...3(1 + 3(...\n9. ...3(1 + 3(...\n\nWait, actually, the expression has 9 instances of \"1 + 3(\", meaning 9 layers. So, the outermost is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I was computing step by step, I went beyond layer 9 because I thought there were more layers. So, I must have miscounted. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the formula again. The general formula for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, my initial mistake was miscounting the number of layers, thinking there were 11 instead of 9. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back to the original problem to make sure. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2.    1 + 3(\n3.        1 + 3(\n4.            1 + 3(\n5.                1 + 3(\n6.                    1 + 3(\n7.                        1 + 3(\n8.                            1 + 3(\n9.                                1 + 3\n9.                            )\n8.                        )\n7.                    )\n6.                )\n5.            )\n4.        )\n3.    )\n2. )\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, each with a \"1 + 3(\" except the innermost, which is just \"1 + 3\". So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by thinking there were more layers, but in reality, it's only 9. So, the correct computation is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach. Let me compute the expression step by step, layer by layer, and see if I get 88572.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nOutermost: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I must have made a mistake earlier by miscounting the layers and going beyond 9 layers. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think I need to be more careful in the future when counting layers or steps to avoid such mistakes. It's easy to miscount, especially under time pressure or when dealing with repetitive structures. But by systematically labeling each layer and ensuring that I count correctly, I can avoid errors. Additionally, using the formula for the recursive sequence helped confirm that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nIn summary, the problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By working from the innermost layer outward and applying the recursive formula, we find that the total expression simplifies to 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me write down the expression to visualize it better. It's like a chain of operations starting from the innermost part and building up. So, the innermost part is (1+3), and then each subsequent layer wraps that result with another (1 + 3*(...)). Since there are nine sets of parentheses, I think I need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside and moving outwards. Let me count the number of layers to make sure. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer, so starting from the innermost, that's layer 1, then each step out is another layer. Let's see: 1+3, then 1+3*(previous), and this repeats until the ninth layer. So, I need to compute nine layers in total. \n\nLet me start by computing the innermost expression and then work my way out. So, the innermost is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 plus 3 is 4. So, layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. \n\nNow, moving out one layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from layer 1)). Since layer 1 gave me 4, this becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from layer 2)). So, that's (1 + 3*13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next layer is (1 + 3*(result from layer 3)). So, (1 + 3*40). Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext, layer 5 would be (1 + 3*(result from layer 4)). That's (1 + 3*121). Let me compute 3*121 first: 121 times 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364. So, layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nMoving on to layer 6, it's (1 + 3*(result from layer 5)). So, (1 + 3*364). Calculating 3*364: 364 times 3 is 1,092. Adding 1 gives 1,093. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093.\n\nNext is layer 7: (1 + 3*(result from layer 6)). So, (1 + 3*1,093). Let's compute 3*1,093. Hmm, 1,000 times 3 is 3,000, and 93 times 3 is 279, so adding those together gives 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 is 3,280. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8 is (1 + 3*(result from layer 7)). So, (1 + 3*3,280). Calculating 3*3,280: 3,000 times 3 is 9,000, and 280 times 3 is 840, so together that's 9,840. Adding 1 gives 9,841. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841.\n\nFinally, layer 9 is (1 + 3*(result from layer 8)). That's (1 + 3*9,841). Let me compute 3*9,841. Breaking it down: 9,000 times 3 is 27,000, and 841 times 3 is 2,523. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives 29,524. So, layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3 times this result. So, after computing the innermost layers up to layer 9, which gives 29,524, we then have to multiply that by 3. Let me write that down: 3 * 29,524. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 29,524 times 3: \n\n- 20,000 times 3 is 60,000.\n- 9,000 times 3 is 27,000.\n- 500 times 3 is 1,500.\n- 24 times 3 is 72.\n\nAdding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculation because I might have made a mistake. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29,524 multiplied by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88,572. Hmm, that's the same as before, so maybe it's correct. \n\nBut wait, let me check if I correctly computed each layer. Because if I messed up one layer, all subsequent layers would be wrong. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct, and the final result inside the parentheses is 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is multiplying the entire nested expression by 3. So, yes, if the nested part evaluates to 29,524, then 3 times that is indeed 88,572. \n\nHmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error somewhere. Let me verify a few of the layers again.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1,093. Let me check 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; 900+180=1,080 +12=1,092. Then, 1 + 1,092=1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; adding together: 3,000 + 270=3,270 +9=3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279=3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3,000*3=9,000, 280*3=840; total 9,840. 1 + 9,840=9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 9,841*3: 9,000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27,000 + 2,400=29,400 + 120=29,520 +3=29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct, and multiplying 29,524 by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. \n\nWait a second, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(...), so I need to make sure that I'm not missing a layer. Let me count the number of 3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). The outermost is 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis is a new layer.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...)) is a layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) - layer 1\n2. The innermost (1+3) is layer 1\n3. Then each subsequent (1+3(...)) adds a layer.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me parse the expression properly.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost 3( ... ), the inner part is 1 + 3(...). So, the first layer is 1 + 3(...), and each inner (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) terms:\n\n1. The outermost is 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then inside that, it's 1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. Then another layer: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. Repeating this until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), that's a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- 3(\n- 1 + 3(\n- 1 + 3(\n- 1 + 3(\n- 1 + 3(\n- 1 + 3(\n- 1 + 3(\n- 1 + 3(\n- 1 + 3(\n- 1 + 3\n- )))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like there are nine layers of (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, in total, there are nine layers, meaning I computed up to layer 9 correctly.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*(29,524) = 88,572. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if the pattern holds. For example, if the expression was just 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))), how would that compute?\n\nLet's compute that smaller version:\n\nStart with the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, computing step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, outermost: 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute the same expression as I did before, starting from the innermost and moving out, I get the same result. So, the method seems correct.\n\nAnother test: Let's take an expression with two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, compute directly: 3(1 + 3(4)) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nSo, the method works for smaller cases. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem should be correct, leading to the answer of 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more the multiplication of 29,524 by 3 because that's where I had a moment of doubt earlier.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524 can be broken into 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24.\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n24 * 3 = 72.\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can do the multiplication digit by digit:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n_________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, after verifying each step and even testing with smaller expressions, I'm confident that the solution is correct.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost parentheses is the last one, which is (1+3). So, I'll compute that first. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, that simplifies the expression a bit. Now, moving one layer out, the next parentheses is (1 + 3(...)), where the ... was just computed as 4. So, replacing that, it becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that:\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, hold on, is that right? Let me check. 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives 13. Yeah, that seems correct. So, now, moving out another layer, the next parentheses would be (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that:\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, okay, so each time I'm moving outward, I'm taking the result from the previous layer, multiplying by 3, and then adding 1. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, after the third layer, we have 40.\n\nProceeding to the next layer out, it would be (1 + 3*40). Calculating that:\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That's correct. Okay, moving on, the next layer is (1 + 3*121). Let me compute that:\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That seems right. Continuing this pattern, the next layer is (1 + 3*364). Let me calculate that:\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nHold on, 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Moving outward again, the next layer is (1 + 3*1093). Let's compute that:\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. That's correct. Next, the eighth layer is (1 + 3*3280). Let me compute that:\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nHmm, 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. That seems right. Now, moving out another layer, the ninth layer is (1 + 3*9841). Let me compute that:\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Finally, the outermost layer is (1 + 3*29524). Let me compute that:\n\nOutermost layer: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, 3 times 29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. That seems correct. Now, the entire expression is 3 times this outermost result, right? Wait, no, hold on. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing the outermost parentheses, which gave us 88573, we then multiply that by 3. So, the final step is:\n\nFinal result: 3 * 88573.\n\nLet me compute that. 3 times 80,000 is 240,000. 3 times 8,000 is 24,000, 3 times 500 is 1,500, 3 times 70 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding all these together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 3 times 88,573. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n88,573 * 3:\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n- 3 * 7 = 21, carry over 2\n- 3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carry over 1\n- 3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carry over 2\n- 3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26\n\nSo, writing it down from right to left: 9, 1, 7, 5, 6, 2. Wait, that would be 265,719. Wait, but let me check: 88,573 * 3.\n\nWait, 80,000 * 3 = 240,000.\n\n8,000 * 3 = 24,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n70 * 3 = 210.\n\n3 * 3 = 9.\n\nAdding them together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. So, yes, 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another method to be sure. Let's compute 88,573 * 3 step by step:\n\n88,573\n\u00d7        3\n----------\n?\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n3 * 3 = 9.\n\n3 * 7 = 21. Write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3 * 5 = 15, plus the carried 2 is 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3 * 8 = 24, plus the carried 1 is 25. Write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3 * 8 = 24, plus the carried 2 is 26. Write down 6, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, there are no more digits, so we write down the carried 2.\n\nSo, the result is 265,719. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. When I was computing each layer, I went from the innermost (1+3)=4, then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each layer was 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting with 4, then 13, then 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and finally 88573. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of those intermediate steps. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*88573 = 265,719. Correct.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time we're doing 1 + 3*(result). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me think about this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost (1+3)=4, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\na_10 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nSo, that's 10 layers, right? From a_1 to a_10. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nBut perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using a formula.\n\nIn this case, our recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 + (c)/(k - 1)) * k^{n-1} - (c)/(k - 1).\n\nWait, let me make sure. The standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, so the homogeneous solution is a_n = A*k^n, and a particular solution can be found. Let me recall the formula.\n\nThe solution is a_n = (a_1 + (c)/(k - 1)) * k^{n - 1} - (c)/(k - 1).\n\nWait, perhaps I should derive it quickly. Let's consider the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nWe can write this as a_n + d = 3*(a_{n-1} + d), where d is a constant to be determined.\n\nExpanding, a_n + d = 3*a_{n-1} + 3d.\n\nBut from the original equation, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, so substituting:\n\n3*a_{n-1} + 1 + d = 3*a_{n-1} + 3d.\n\nSubtracting 3*a_{n-1} from both sides: 1 + d = 3d.\n\nSo, 1 = 2d => d = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution can be written as a_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2).\n\nThis shows that the sequence b_n = a_n + 1/2 satisfies b_n = 3*b_{n-1}, which is a geometric sequence with ratio 3.\n\nGiven that, we can write b_n = b_1 * 3^{n - 1}.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, then b_1 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, b_n = (9/2) * 3^{n - 1}.\n\nTherefore, a_n = b_n - 1/2 = (9/2)*3^{n - 1} - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\na_n = (9/2)*3^{n - 1} - 1/2 = (9*3^{n - 1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each n, a_n = (9*3^{n - 1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (9*3^{0} - 1)/2 = (9*1 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (9*3^{1} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (9*3^2 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (9*81 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Wait, hold on, no, 3^3 is 27, so 9*27=243, 243-1=242, 242/2=121. Correct.\n\nWait, no, wait, for n=4, 3^{4-1}=3^3=27, so 9*27=243, 243-1=242, 242/2=121. Correct.\n\nWait, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2.\n\nGiven that, in our problem, we have 10 layers, so n=10.\n\nThus, a_10 = (9*3^{9} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, 3^9=19683.\n\nThus, a_10 = (9*19683 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 9*19683: 19683*9. Let's compute that.\n\n19683 * 9:\n\n3*9=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n8*9=72 +2=74, write down 4, carry over7.\n\n6*9=54 +7=61, write down 1, carry over6.\n\n9*9=81 +6=87, write down7, carry over8.\n\n1*9=9 +8=17.\n\nSo, writing it down: 177,147.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n19683 * 9:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n19,000 *9=171,000\n\n683*9=6,147\n\nSo, 171,000 +6,147=177,147. Correct.\n\nSo, 9*19683=177,147.\n\nThus, a_10=(177,147 -1)/2=177,146/2=88,573. Correct, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is 88,573, and the entire expression is 3*88,573=265,719.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 265,719.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing the expression in another way, perhaps by expanding the entire expression and seeing if it can be represented as a geometric series.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to write this expression in terms of nested 3s and 1s.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, starting from the innermost, as before, then the entire expression is 3*a_10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, considering that each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and each next layer is similar, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as a sum of 3^k from k=0 to k=9, multiplied by some factor.\n\nWait, let me think. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nWait, but E itself is similar to the inner expressions. Wait, but in our case, it's a finite nesting of 9 layers. So, perhaps it's a finite geometric series.\n\nWait, but in our earlier approach, we found that a_n = (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2. So, for n=10, a_10=(9*3^9 -1)/2=88,573, and then E=3*a_10=265,719.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as follows:\n\nLet me write the expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 layers inside.\n\nWait, but since it's finite, it's not an infinite series, so perhaps we can't use the infinite geometric series formula. However, from our earlier step-by-step computation, we saw that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a_n = (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression by expanding each multiplication step by step, but that might be tedious given the number of layers. However, since I've already confirmed it through two methods, perhaps it's sufficient.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute it in another way, just to be absolutely sure.\n\nLet me start by writing down each layer step by step, as I did before, but perhaps in a table for clarity.\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nYes, that's consistent with both the step-by-step approach and the formula using the recurrence relation.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the computed value of the expression is 265,719.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\).\n4. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\).\n5. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\).\n6. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\).\n7.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last term, which is $(1+3)$. That's straightforward: 1 plus 3 is 4. So, let me write that down. \n\nInnermost parentheses: $(1 + 3) = 4$. \n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is $(1 + 3(1 + 3))$. Wait, but hold on, actually, looking again, each level is 1 plus 3 times the next level. So, each time, after computing the innermost parentheses, we substitute it back into the expression and compute the next one. Let me make sure I understand the structure correctly. \n\nThe original expression is: \n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I think there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count. Starting from the first 3, then each (1 + 3(...)), so each time it's a new level. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) parts. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: (1 + 3*(result from step 1))\n3. Then: (1 + 3*(result from step 2))\n4. And so on, until we go all the way out.\n\nSo, actually, there are nine levels of these nested expressions. Each time, we compute the innermost one, then use that result to compute the next one out, and so on, until we reach the outermost expression. Then, finally, we multiply the entire thing by 3. \n\nWait, let me confirm that. The expression is 3 times a big parenthesis. Inside that parenthesis, it's 1 plus 3 times another parenthesis. Inside that, it's 1 plus 3 times another, and so on, nine times. So, yes, nine layers of nesting. So, I'll need to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. \n\nLet me try to write this down more clearly. Let me denote each level as Level 1 to Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost and Level 9 is the outermost. \n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n...\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8)\nAnd then, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9)\n\nSo, that seems manageable. Let me compute each level step by step.\n\nStarting with Level 1:\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it more carefully.\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check if I did each level correctly, because 88572 seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Let me go back and verify each step.\n\nStarting with Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think about this problem in terms of a geometric series or a recurrence relation, but given that it's only nine levels deep, computing each step manually is feasible and probably less error-prone.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating it for now, since we can compute each step manually. But just to satisfy my curiosity, let me try to model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, as computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n2. Compute each level step by step, substituting the result back into the next level.\n3. Alternatively, model the problem as a recurrence relation and derive a closed-form formula to compute the result directly.\n4. Verify both methods yield the same result, ensuring accuracy.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. It also reinforced the importance of careful step-by-step computation to avoid errors, especially with multiple layers of nesting.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each level from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous level)}\\). By calculating each level step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent level builds on this result. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula to compute the result directly. Both methods confirm that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, starting from the innermost one, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost part: (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, so now, moving one step outward, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so the next layer out is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. Let me try to see if there's a pattern here. So, each step seems to be of the form: 1 + 3*(previous result). Maybe I can compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result as I go. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait a second, let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to get lost in the numbers here.\n\nStarting again:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. That seems correct.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nOkay, so that seems consistent. Now, after computing all those layers, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by the last result, which is 29524. So, let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nHmm, let me do that multiplication step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\n- 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 27.\n\nWait, let me write that out properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n29524\nx      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nFinally, since there are no more digits, write down the remaining 27? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 2 * 3 is 6, plus 2 is 8, and then the next digit is 9, but I think I might have messed up the place values. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\n?\n\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSince there are no more digits, write the carryover if any, but here it's 0, so we're done.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdd them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression had nine sets of parentheses, each with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I computed up to the ninth layer, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me recount the number of layers to make sure I didn't miss any or count extra. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent (1 + 3(...)) is a new layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears, which is 9 times. So, starting from the innermost, I correctly computed 9 layers, each time moving outward, and then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nSo, yes, 88572 should be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. This seems like a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9, which is 29524. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods confirm the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing all layers, the outermost expression is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, if I can compute the innermost part first, then build my way up, that should work. Let me write this out more clearly. Starting from the innermost parentheses, which is (1+3). Then moving outward, each time I compute a term, I can substitute it back into the outer expression. \n\nLet me write down each step as I compute each layer. \n\nFirst, let's define each level. Let me number them from the innermost to the outermost. So, starting with the innermost parentheses as level 1, then each layer outward as level 2, level 3, and so on up to level 9, since I count 9 sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me check that again. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nWait, actually, each time after the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) inside each other. \n\nStarting from the first 3, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, each time, there's another layer. Let me count the number of times I see (1+3(...)). \n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the first one after the initial 3, each subsequent layer is another (1+3(...)). Let me see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost part, which is (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers is that? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: \n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is the first layer.\n- Inside that, another (1+3(...)), second layer.\n- Continuing, each time, so let's count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses. Wait, no, because each (1+3(...)) starts with a parenthesis, so let's see:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time, the next term is (1+3(...)). Let me count how many times this occurs:\n\n1. The first (1+3(...)) is the innermost one: (1+3)\n2. Then each time, moving outward, so that's 9 layers? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, actually, let's see how many times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, the innermost is (1+3). Then moving outward, each time, it's (1+3(...)). So, each time, we have a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is level 1: (1+3). Then level 2: (1+3( level1 )). Level3: (1+3( level2 )). And so on, until level9, which is the outermost. Wait, but how many levels are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is: 3 followed by 9 opening parentheses, each with a 1+3(...). So, that would mean 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is level 1: (1+3). Then level 2: (1+3( level1 )). Level3: (1+3( level2 )), and so on up to level9. So, I need to compute from level1 to level9, each time substituting the result of the inner level into the outer one. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each (1+3(...) starts with a '(', so let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3, the first ( is (1+3(...)), which is level1.\n\nThen, inside that, another (1+3(...)), which is level2.\n\nContinuing this way, each time, the number of opening parentheses increases by one. So, how many times do we have (1+3(...) ?\n\nLet me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then each time moving outward, it's (1+3(...)). So, how many times is this? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, let's count the number of (1+3(...)) sections:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, actually, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), so up to 9 layers. Wait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, I see that the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is (1+3(...)), which is level1.\n\n- Then inside that, another (1+3(...)), level2.\n\n- Continuing, each time, so let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLet me write down the expression with each opening parenthesis numbered:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first ( after 3 is level1.\n\nThen inside that, another ( is level2.\n\nThen level3, level4, level5, level6, level7, level8, level9.\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, after the initial 3, the first ( is level1, then inside that, another ( is level2, and so on, until level9, which is the last ( before the closing )) at the end.\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, the innermost part is (1+3), which is level1.

And so on, until level9, which would be the outermost (1+3(...)) before the final closing parentheses.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, I think there are 9 of them. Let me check:\n\nAfter the 3, the expression is (1+3(...)). Let me see:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is level1.\n\n- Then inside that, another ( is level2.\n\n- Continuing, so each time, another (, up to level9.\n\nSo, that means we have 9 layers to compute, starting from level1 to level9.\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, the innermost part is (1+3), which is level1. Then level2 is (1+3( level1 )). Level3 is (1+3( level2 )). Level4 is (1+3( level3 )). And so on, up to level9.\n\nSo, I can compute each level starting from level1, then level2, and so on, up to level9, then multiply by the initial 3.\n\nLet me start by computing level1: (1+3). That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, level1 = 4.\n\nThen level2 is (1 + 3 * level1). Since level1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, level2 = 13.\n\nLevel3 is (1 + 3 * level2). Level2 is 13, so 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel3 = 40.\n\nLevel4 is (1 + 3 * level3). Level3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel4 = 121.\n\nLevel5 is (1 + 3 * level4). Level4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel5 = 364.\n\nLevel6 is (1 + 3 * level5). Level5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel6 = 1093.\n\nLevel7 is (1 + 3 * level6). Level6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel7 = 3280.\n\nLevel8 is (1 + 3 * level7). Level7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel8 = 9841.\n\nLevel9 is (1 + 3 * level8). Level8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nLevel9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by level9, which is 29524.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3 * 29524.\n\nWell, 3 * 20000 = 60000.\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000.\n\n3 * 500 = 1500.\n\n3 * 24 = 72.\n\nWait, but that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n5 *3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n*     3\n---------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3 = 12. Write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 *3 =6 +1=7. Write 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 *3=15. Write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through each level again to verify.\n\nLevel1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLevel2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLevel3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLevel4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLevel5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLevel6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 *29524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can check by computing each level step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each level seems to be following a certain formula. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth level.\n\nLooking at the levels:\n\nLevel1: 4\n\nLevel2:13\n\nLevel3:40\n\nLevel4:121\n\nLevel5:364\n\nLevel6:1093\n\nLevel7:3280\n\nLevel8:9841\n\nLevel9:29524\n\nHmm, let's see if there's a recurrence relation here. Each level is 1 + 3 * previous level.\n\nSo, Level(n) = 1 + 3*Level(n-1), with Level1=4.\n\nSo, let me see if that holds.\n\nYes, Level2=1+3*4=13, correct.\n\nLevel3=1+3*13=40, correct.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the general formula for Level(n) is 1 + 3*Level(n-1), with Level1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is Level(n) = 3*Level(n-1) +1, with Level1=4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: Level(n) = 3*Level(n-1).\n\nThe characteristic equation is r=3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Level_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1.\n\nSolving for A: A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Level(n) = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. At n=1, Level(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C -1/2.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is Level(n) = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: Level(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values.\n\nAt n=1: (3^(2)-1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nAt n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nAt n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nAt n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nAt n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nAt n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nAt n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nAt n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nAt n=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Level(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Level9, it's (3^10 -1)/2=29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Level9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, 3^10=59049.\n\nThen, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each level is building upon the previous one, and the entire expression is a sum that can be expressed as a geometric series.\n\nBut since we've already computed it step by step and verified with the formula, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, here's the step-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4.\n\n2. Use this result in the next layer: 1 + 3*4=13.\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n\n   - 1 + 3*13=40\n\n   - 1 + 3*40=121\n\n   - 1 + 3*121=364\n\n   - 1 + 3*364=1093\n\n   - 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\n   - 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\n   - 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\n4. Multiply the outermost result by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation Level(n) = 1 + 3 * Level(n-1), starting with Level1 = 4.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let me write this out more clearly. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with a 1 and then adding 3 times another expression. So, maybe I can start by evaluating the innermost one and then work my way outwards. Let me count the number of closing parentheses to confirm how deep it goes. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to an opening one, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the end, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then each step out adds another layer. Let me count the number of layers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, nine layers in total. That means I'll have to compute nine steps, each time evaluating the innermost expression and substituting it back into the outer ones. \n\nLet me write this down step by step. I'll start with the innermost parentheses and move outward, computing each layer as I go. I'll assign each step a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3).\n\nStep 2: Substitute that result into the next layer, which is 3*(result from step 1 + 3).\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps it's better to think of each step as evaluating the innermost expression first, then moving outwards. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Then each layer is defined as:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but looking at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is indeed 1 + 3*next_layer. Therefore, starting from L1 = 1 + 3, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on until L9, and then the total expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would correspond to L1 = 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. The innermost is (1 + 3), so that's 4. Then the next layer out is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3): 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n2. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 1)): 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out:\n\n3. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 2)): 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing this way, each time substituting the result from the previous step into the next layer. Let me try to write this down systematically.\n\nLet me create a table where each row represents a step, starting from the innermost (step 1) to the outermost (step 9), and then the final step (step 10) which is multiplying by 3.\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: (1 + 3*Step1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: (1 + 3*Step2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: (1 + 3*Step3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: (1 + 3*Step4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: (1 + 3*Step5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: (1 + 3*Step6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: (1 + 3*Step7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: (1 + 3*Step8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Step9, so:\n\nStep 10: 3*Step9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an error in arithmetic when dealing with large numbers.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. So 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nStep 10: 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572. So 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of steps. Since the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each step corresponds to one layer, so starting from the innermost, I did nine steps, each time computing the next layer, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 is the tenth step. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. The recurrence is linear, so maybe I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, L_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. Let me adjust the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the recurrence starting from n=0. Let me redefine the layers as L_0, L_1, ..., L_8, where L_0 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, with L_0 = 4, then L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to L_8, which would be the innermost layer. Then the entire expression is 3*L_8.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I had L1 to L9, but perhaps aligning the indices differently can help. Let me try to model this as a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_0 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. At n=0, L_0 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^0 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = C*1 - 1/2 \u21d2 C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let me compute L_0 using this formula: (9*3^0 - 1)/2 = (9*1 -1)/2 = (8)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nL_1: (9*3^1 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nL_2: (9*9 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nL_3: (9*27 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for the initial terms. Therefore, for n layers, the value of the innermost expression is L_n = (9*3^n -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, starting from the innermost, we have nine layers. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is L1 = 4, which corresponds to n=0 in this formula, since L0=4. So, for each layer, n increases by 1 as we move outward. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is L8 in this case, would correspond to n=8. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the problem, we have nine layers of (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost as L1, then L2, up to L9. But in my earlier approach using the formula, I had L0=4, L1=13, etc. So, L0 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is (1 + 3). Therefore, if we have nine layers, that would correspond to n=8 in the formula, because L0 is the first, L1 the second, up to L8 being the ninth layer. Therefore, the value of the ninth layer is L8 = (9*3^8 -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^8 first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, L8 = (9*6561 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the result I got earlier in step 9.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L8 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute the result without having to go through each step manually, which is much faster, especially for a larger number of layers.\n\nBut since I was doing it manually earlier, it's good that both methods gave me the same result, which gives me confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form (1 + 3*(...)). By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost outwards, I arrived at the result of 29,524 for the innermost expression, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final answer of 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach corroborates the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outward, we find the value of each layer step by step. The innermost layer is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). Each subsequent layer is computed by substituting the previous result into the next layer's expression. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinal expression: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the left, each opening parenthesis is followed by 1 + 3*(...), and I can see that there are nine sets of these. Wait, let me check again. The expression is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ So, starting from the innermost part, it's 1+3, then each level adds another 1+3*(previous result).

Therefore, I can approach this by starting from the innermost layer and working my way outwards, computing each layer step by step. \n\nLet me write down each step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3. Then L2 = 1 + 3*(L1), L3 = 1 + 3*(L2), and so on until L9. Then the final result is 3*(L9). Okay, let me compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9), so that's 3*29524.

Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost. Let me count how many times this happens. Each time I see a new 1+3, it's a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears nested.\n\nLooking at the expression, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the innermost 1+3. Each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears as a nested expression.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ \n\nSo, after the first 3, each opening parenthesis is followed by 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the next is (1+3( which is the first opening parenthesis. Then inside that, another (1+3(, and so on. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. ... (1+3(\n3. ... (1+3(\n4. ... (1+3(\n5. ... (1+3(\n6. ... (1+3(\n7. ... (1+3(\n8. ... (1+3(\n9. ... (1+3(\n10. ... (1+3(\n11. ... (1+3)\n12. ... )\n... etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, the first is 3(, then inside that, another (, and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then inside, 1+3(\n3. Then another ( after that\n4. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of (1+3(...) expressions. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ \n\nEach time, after a 3, there's a (1+3(...)). Let me count how many times this occurs.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then inside it, another 3, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see that each layer adds a new 1+3, so the number of layers is equal to the number of 1+3 terms nested within each other. Let me try to count the number of 1+3 expressions.\n\nFrom the innermost, it's 1+3. Then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nContinuing until Layer 9, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, but when I counted the layers earlier, I ended up with L9=29524, and then 3*29524=88572. But that seems like a very large number, so I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula for such expressions. Let me think: the expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))), with n layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, perhaps there's a formula for the nth term in such a sequence.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as before, a_9 = 29524, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ \n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the next ( is layer 1, then inside that, another ( is layer 2, and so on until the last ( before the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then inside, 1+3(\n3. Then another (\n4. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times the pattern 1+3( occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(.\n\nLet me see: the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term, which would be 9.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses, it's 9. Let me see: the expression starts with 3(, then inside that, 1+3(, then another (, and so on until the last ( before the innermost 1+3. So, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer. So, the number of layers is 9, which would mean a_9 is the innermost, and then we have to compute up to a_9 and multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed a_9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm counting the layers correctly. Because the expression is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, which means n=9 in the formula. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the number of layers. Each time I see a 1+3(, that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. ... (1+3(\n3. ... (1+3(\n4. ... (1+3(\n5. ... (1+3(\n6. ... (1+3(\n7. ... (1+3(\n8. ... (1+3(\n9. ... (1+3(\n10. ... (1+3)\n\nWait, that seems like 10 layers, but when I computed earlier, I only went up to a_9=29524, which would correspond to 9 layers. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because the innermost is 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, it's layer 1: 1+3, then layer 2: 1+3*(layer1), up to layer9: 1+3*(layer8). Then the outermost expression is 3*(layer9). Therefore, there are 9 layers, and the number of 1+3 terms is 9.\n\nBut when I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the next is (1+3(, which is layer1. Then inside that, another (1+3(, which is layer2, and so on until the innermost (1+3). So, how many opening parentheses are there after the first 3?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then (1+3(\n3. Then (1+3(\n4. Then (1+3(\n5. Then (1+3(\n6. Then (1+3(\n7. Then (1+3(\n8. Then (1+3(\n9. Then (1+3(\n10. Then (1+3)\n\nWait, that's 10 opening parentheses, but the innermost is 1+3 without any more parentheses. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, with the innermost being 1+3, and each layer adding another 1+3*(...). Therefore, the number of layers is 9, which matches the a_9=29524.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see that there are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the next is (1+3( which is layer1. Then inside that, another (1+3( which is layer2, and so on until the innermost (1+3. So, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9, which would mean 9 layers, hence a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this by computing a smaller version. Let's say we have only two layers: 3(1+3(1+3)). What would that be?\n\nCompute innermost: 1+3=4\n\nThen, 1+3*4=13\n\nThen, 3*13=39\n\nSo, total is 39.\n\nUsing the formula, a_2=13, 3*a_2=39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, with three layers: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1+3=4\n\nNext: 1+3*4=13\n\nNext: 1+3*13=40\n\nThen, 3*40=120.\n\nUsing the formula, a_3=40, 3*a_3=120. Correct.\n\nSo, if I have n layers, the total is 3*a_n, where a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ \n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 terms inside each other.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n10. 3*(... )\n\nWait, so actually, the number of layers is 10 because each 1+3 adds a new layer, starting from 1+3 as layer1, up to layer10 being the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, that can't be because the formula gives a_9=29524, but if there are 10 layers, then a_10 would be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the number of layers with the number of terms. Let me clarify.\n\nEach time I have a 1+3*(...), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost 1+3, that's layer1. Then each subsequent 1+3*(...) is a new layer.\n\nSo, in the expression, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer1.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next is 1+3*(layer1), which is layer2.\n\nThen, 1+3*(layer2) is layer3.\n\nContinuing until the outermost expression, which is 3*(layer9).\n\nWait, so the outermost is 3*(layer9), meaning there are 9 layers of 1+3*(...), plus the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, no, the outermost is 3*(layer9), where layer9 is 1+3*(layer8). So, the total number of layers is 9.\n\nTherefore, a_9=29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3, yielding the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1+3). That seems straightforward enough. So, let me compute that first. \n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses. \nSo, (1 + 3) equals 4. That part was simple. Now, moving one level out, the next parentheses is (1 + 3(1 + 3)). Wait, but I just computed (1 + 3) as 4, so that part inside the next parentheses becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 2: Compute the next level.\nSo, 3 times 4 is 12, right? Then, 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next parentheses evaluates to 13. Now, moving out another level, the next expression is (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). But I've already computed (1 + 3(1 + 3)) as 13, so now this becomes (1 + 3*13). Let's calculate that.\n\nStep 3: Next level out.\n3 multiplied by 13 is 39, and adding 1 gives me 40. So, now that parentheses is 40. Moving out another layer, the next one is (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))). Wait, I just computed (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) as 40, so this becomes (1 + 3*40). Let's compute that.\n\nStep 4: Next level.\n3 times 40 is 120, and adding 1 gives 121. So, that parentheses is 121. Moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) which I now know is (1 + 3*121). Let's calculate that.\n\nStep 5: Next level.\n3 multiplied by 121 is 363, and adding 1 gives 364. So, that parentheses is 364. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))). I just computed the inner part as 364, so this becomes (1 + 3*364). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 6: Next level.\n3 times 364 is... let's see, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, that parentheses is 1093. Moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))). I just computed the inner part as 1093, so this becomes (1 + 3*1093). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 7: Next level.\n3 times 1093. Hmm, let's break that down. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, that parentheses is 3280. Moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))). I just computed the inner part as 3280, so this becomes (1 + 3*3280). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 8: Next level.\n3 multiplied by 3280. Let's compute that. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, that parentheses is 9841. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) which I just computed as 9841, so this becomes (1 + 3*9841). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 9: Next level.\n3 times 9841. Let's break that down. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, that parentheses is 29524. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) which I just computed as 29524, so this becomes (1 + 3*29524). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 10: Next level.\n3 multiplied by 29524. Let's compute that. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. So, that parentheses is 88573. Now, moving out to the very outermost layer, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3 multiplied by 88573.\n\nStep 11: Compute the final multiplication.\n3 times 88573. Let me compute that. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that addition because I might have made a mistake. So, 240000 + 24000 is indeed 264000. Then, 264000 + 1500 is 265500. Then, 265500 + 210 is 265710. Finally, 265710 + 9 is 265719. Hmm, that seems correct. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify 3*88573 another way. 88573 times 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n3 * 7 = 21, carryover 2\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, carryover 2\n3 * 0 = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nWait, that seems off because 88573 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it out:\n\n88573\ntimes     3\n----------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, write down 1, carryover 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carryover 2\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carryover 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write down the carryover 2.\n\nSo, putting it together: 265719. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 3*88573 is indeed 265719.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265719.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps because that seems like a big number, and sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each step again briefly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. (1 + 3*29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\n11. 3*88573 = 265719\n\nEach step seems to follow correctly. So, I think my answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about whether there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each time we're doing 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, let's see how many layers there are. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from (1 + 3), that's one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another, so in total, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original problem: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n- 3(\n- Then inside, 1+3(\n- Then another 1+3(\n- And so on, until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1+3 starts a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)).\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, the innermost is the 9th layer. Therefore, I have a_1 to a_9, each defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Let's see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier in step 9.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in my previous calculation, I had 3*a_9 as 265719, but according to this formula, a_9 is 29524, so 3*a_9 is 88572. But that contradicts my earlier step-by-step calculation where I ended up with 265719. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check. If a_9 is 29524, then 3*a_9 is 88572, but in my step-by-step, I had 3*88573 = 265719. Wait, so where is the confusion?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count them.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, so actually, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), so the outermost layer is layer 9. Therefore, a_9 is the innermost, and the outermost is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I started from the innermost as step 1: (1+3)=4, then step 2: (1+3*4)=13, which would be a_2=13, and so on up to a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 88573 and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. So, that suggests that perhaps I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1: a1 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*a_n). So, the next layer is (1 + 3*a1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is a2.\n\nThen, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing this way, up to a9, which would be the 9th layer. So, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*a9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 88573 and then multiplied by 3, which gave me 265719. So, I think I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, a9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went up to (1 + 3*29524) = 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. So, that suggests that I added an extra layer beyond the 9th, which isn't actually there.\n\nWait, looking back at the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3(...)) is a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, meaning that the outermost is 3*(a9). So, in my initial step-by-step, I think I mistakenly considered the outermost as another layer, which it isn't. Therefore, I should have stopped at a9=29524 and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\nStep 1: 4\n\nStep 2: 13\n\nStep 3: 40\n\nStep 4: 121\n\nStep 5: 364\n\nStep 6: 1093\n\nStep 7: 3280\n\nStep 8: 9841\n\nStep 9: 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my original step-by-step, I went up to (1 + 3*29524) = 88573, which is a10, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. So, that suggests that I considered 10 layers, but the original problem only has 9. Therefore, my initial step-by-step had an extra layer, leading to an incorrect result.\n\nSo, where did I go wrong? Let me look back.\n\nOriginal problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's see how many closing parentheses there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each (1+3 has a corresponding ). Let me count the number of closing parentheses.\n\nFrom the innermost, each layer adds a ). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another ). Let me count the number of ) in the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- The first 3( opens, then inside is 1+3(...), which has 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of (1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3 before it. So, the number of (1+3(...) is 9.\n\nTherefore, the outermost is 3*(a9). So, in my initial step-by-step, I mistakenly went up to a10, which isn't part of the original problem.\n\nTherefore, the correct result should be 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\nAfter step 9: (1 + 3*29524) = 88573, which would be a10, but that's not part of the original problem because the original problem only has 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I added an extra layer beyond the 9th, leading to an incorrect final answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572, not 265719.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this because I'm getting conflicting results between the step-by-step and the formula approach.\n\nUsing the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\nAfter step 9: a9=29524\n\nThen, step 10: 3*a9=88572\n\nBut in my original thought process, I continued to step 10 and beyond, which was incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this by recalculating the step-by-step without adding an extra layer.\n\nSo, let's redo the step-by-step correctly, stopping at a9.\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 steps, we have a9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my initial step-by-step by considering an extra layer beyond the 9th, which wasn't part of the original problem. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me compute it another way. Let's compute the entire expression step by step, correctly stopping at the 9th layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Compute (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Compute (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Compute (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Compute (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Compute (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Compute (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Compute (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Compute (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think my initial mistake was miscounting the number of layers, which led me to an incorrect final answer. By carefully recounting and ensuring that I only go up to the 9th layer, I arrive at the correct result of 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, with n=9, gives a9=29524, and 3*a9=88572.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " \n\nLet me try to write this out step by step. The innermost part is the last 1+3. So, starting from there, let's compute each layer one by one. Maybe I can label each layer to keep track. Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1, then each layer wraps around the previous one, so the next one is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9 since there are nine sets of parentheses. \n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 3(1+... parts. Starting from the left, I see 3(...), then inside that, another 3(...), and so on. Let me count them: 3(...), then inside that, another 3(...), and so on until the innermost part. Hmm, how many layers are there? Let me see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is nested inside the previous one. Let me count the number of 3s. The first term is 3, then inside that, another 3, and so on until the innermost part. Let me count them: 3, then another 3, another, another, another, another, another, another, another. That's 9 threes in total, each nested inside the previous one. So, that means there are 9 layers to compute, starting from the innermost one and working our way out. \n\nSo, let me start by labeling each layer from 1 to 9. Layer 1 is the innermost: 1+3. Then Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer1), Layer3 is 1+3*(Layer2), and so on, up to Layer9, which is the outermost expression, which is 3*(Layer9). Wait, actually, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Layer9, we have to multiply it by 3. So, maybe I should compute Layer1 through Layer9, each time substituting the previous layer's result into the next one, and then finally multiply the result by 3. \n\nLet me try to write this down step by step. \n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So, after computing Layer9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. \n\n3*29524: Let's compute 30000*3=90000, but since it's 29524, which is 30000 - 476, so 90000 - (476*3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have computed each layer step by step as I did initially, but using the formula is much faster and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\nSo, in summary, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula, which allows us to compute a_9 efficiently without having to calculate each layer manually. Then, multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. By solving this recurrence, we find that each layer can be expressed using a formula, allowing us to compute the result efficiently. \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). \n\n2. **Define the recurrence relation**: Let a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. For each subsequent layer, a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081.\n\n3. **Solve the recurrence**: The solution to the recurrence relation a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 is a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the innermost layers**: Using the formula, compute each layer up to a\u2089:\n   - a\u2081 = 4\n   - a\u2082 = 13\n   - a\u2083 = 40\n   - a\u2084 = 121\n   - a\u2085 = 364\n   - a\u2086 = 1093\n   - a\u2087 = 3280\n   - a\u2088 = 9841\n   - a\u2089 = 29524\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The outermost expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost parentheses is the last one, which is $(1+3)$. So, I'll compute that first. Let's do that step by step. \n\nFirst, compute the innermost parentheses:\n1. The innermost expression is $(1 + 3)$. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. \n2. Now, moving one level out, the next parentheses would be $(1 + 3(4))$. Wait, let me make sure I'm following correctly. Each level is 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, starting from the inside, each time I solve a parentheses, I substitute its value into the next one. \n\nLet me try to write this down step by step to keep track. Maybe if I number each level, it'll help me see the pattern. \n\nLet me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count: starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Level 1: (1+3). Then Level 2 is (1+3*(Level 1)). Level 3 is (1+3*(Level 2)), and so on until Level 9. Hmm, but looking at the original problem, I see that there are actually nine sets of parentheses, each nested within the previous one, starting from the innermost as (1+3) and going up. So, maybe there are nine levels to compute here. \n\nWait, let me check the original problem again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). So, let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. It's inside each other, so let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then the next is (1+3*(innermost))\n3. Then the next is (1+3*(previous result)), and so on, until the outermost parentheses. So, how many times do we do this? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, each 1+3 is nested within another, so each time we have an additional layer. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. \n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and compute each level step by step. Let me try that. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving out one level, we have:\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext level:\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, but the original problem is 3 times that entire expression. So, after computing the innermost parentheses up to Level 9, which gives us 29524, we then multiply by 3. So, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n- 2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7\n- 5*3 =15, write down 5, carry over 1\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8\n- 3 (the next digit) is 0, so 0*3=0, write down 0\nWait, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, let me compute each digit:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) =7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 =15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because when I did it earlier, I thought the final result was 88572, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, 29524 *3: Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nCompute 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 *3 =88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the levels. Let me go through each level again step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting with Level 1: (1+3)=4. That's correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 +3*(4)=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLevel3:1 +3*(13)=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLevel4:1 +3*(40)=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLevel5:1 +3*(121)=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLevel6:1 +3*(364)=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel7:1 +3*(1093)=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel8:1 +3*(3280)=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel9:1 +3*(9841)=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's the final result.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of levels. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...), so the number of levels is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears. Let me count how many times 1+3 is present:\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 is inside another 1+3. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds another level. So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3, so the number of levels is 9, as I computed above. So, Level1 to Level9, each time computing 1+3*(previous level). So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again. It's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each time wrapping another (1+3(...)) around it. So, yes, 9 levels. So, my computation seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's a faster way to compute this without manually computing each level. Maybe using a formula for geometric series or something like that. Let me see.\n\nEach level is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. So, this is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe recursive formula is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L(1)= (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2)= (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L(n)= (3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L(9)= (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, as computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*L(9)=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's a much faster way to compute it without having to go through each level manually.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me verify this with another approach.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each time we have a term like 1 + 3*(...), it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. So, perhaps we can model this as a sum.\n\nBut given that the expression is fully nested, the recursive approach seems more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since we've already derived a formula for L(n), and confirmed it with multiple checks, it's safe to say that the result is correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recursively evaluating each level from the innermost parentheses outward. Using a recursive formula and a closed-form solution, we find that the expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). The innermost level is (1 + 3), and each subsequent level wraps another 1 + 3*(...).\n\n2. **Recursive Formula:** Each level can be defined recursively as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting with L(1) = 4.\n\n3. **Closed-Form Solution:** Solving the recurrence relation, we find L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute L(9):** For the ninth level, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me write this down to visualize it better. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with a 1 and then adding 3 times another expression. So, maybe I should start from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), and work my way outwards. Let me count the number of times this pattern repeats. Let's see, each opening parenthesis adds another layer, so starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, and moving out to the first layer.\n\nSo, let's define each layer as a step. Let me assign variables to each step to make it easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let\u2019s define a_1 as the innermost expression: a_1 = 1 + 3\n- Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n- Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n- And this pattern continues up to a_9, which would be the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but actually, the outermost expression is 3 times (a_9), right? So, the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is 1 + 3*a_8, and so on.\n\nSo, to compute this, I need to compute each a_i starting from a_1 up to a_9, and then multiply a_9 by 3.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\n1. Compute a_1 = 1 + 3\n2. Compute a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n3. Compute a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n4. Compute a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3\n5. Compute a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4\n6. Compute a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5\n7. Compute a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6\n8. Compute a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7\n9. Compute a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n10. Finally, compute the entire expression as 3*a_9.\n\nOkay, let's start computing each a_i step by step.\n\nStarting with a_1:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, moving on to a_2:\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, a_2 is 13. Next, a_3:\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, a_3 is 40. Now, a_4:\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nOkay, a_4 is 121. Moving on to a_5:\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nSo, a_5 is 364. Next, a_6:\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWow, a_6 is 1093. Now, a_7:\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nThat's a big number, 3280. Next, a_8:\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nOkay, a_8 is 9841. Finally, a_9:\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, a_9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, but actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, adding up each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nStarting from a_1:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here to compute this without calculating each step individually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each a_i is defined as a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}. This is a recursive relation, and it's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_i.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_i = c + r*a_{i-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_i = A*r^i + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, actually, for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_i = r*a_{i-1} + c, the closed-form solution is a_i = r^{i} * a_0 + c*(r^{i} - 1)/(r - 1), where a_0 is the initial term.\n\nIn our case, a_1 = 4, which is when i=1. Let's adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nGiven a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, but in our case, a_1 is 4, which would correspond to a_0 being (a_1 - 1)/3 = (4 - 1)/3 = 1. So, a_0 = 1.\n\nThen, the general solution for a_i would be a_i = a_0 * 3^{i} + (3^{i} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify that.\n\nThe standard formula for a_i = r*a_{i-1} + c is:\n\na_i = r^{i} * (a_0 + (c)/(r - 1)) - (c)/(r - 1)\n\nWait, maybe I should derive it.\n\nGiven a_i = 3*a_{i-1} + 1, with a_0 = 1.\n\nWait, in our case, starting from a_1, but perhaps it's easier to shift indices.\n\nLet me consider a_i = 3*a_{i-1} + 1, with a_0 = 1.\n\nThen, the solution is a homogeneous and particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_i^{(h)} = C*3^{i}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_i = C*3^{i} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_0 = 1:\n\n1 = C*3^{0} - 1/2 => 1 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^{i} - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for i=0:\n\na_0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\ni=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\ni=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\ni=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 =27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result without having to compute each step individually. That was a good exercise. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation can simplify the computation, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the formula in case the number of layers increases.\n\nWait, another thought: since each a_i is (3^{i+1} -1)/2, then a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, which we calculated as 29524. Then, 3*a_9 is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 59049*3=177147.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.\n\nSame result. So, that's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times, which is equivalent to 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ), which simplifies to (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBut regardless of the method, the result is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. It's always good to verify each step, especially when dealing with multiple layers of nested expressions. It's easy to make an arithmetic mistake, but by systematically computing each a_i and then using the closed-form formula, I can be sure that I didn't make any errors along the way.\n\nAnother thing I might consider is whether there's a pattern or a geometric series involved here. Since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it does resemble a geometric series where each term is scaled by 3 each time. The closed-form formula we derived earlier is essentially the sum of such a geometric series.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each step manually, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form solution, the result remains consistent. Therefore, I can be certain that the computed value is accurate.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers.\n2. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).\n3. Starting from the innermost layer, compute each subsequent layer by substituting the result of the inner layer.\n4. Recognizing the recurrence relation allows the use of a closed-form formula, which simplifies computation.\n5. Both methods lead to the same result: 88572.\n\nSo, I think I'm done here. The answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\)\n- \\( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 \\)\n- \\( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 \\)\n- \\( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 \\)\n- \\( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 \\)\n- \\( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 \\)\n- \\( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 \\)\n- \\( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 \\)\n- \\( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 \\)\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression as \\( 3 \\cdot a_9 \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, that's the innermost parentheses. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which was 13. So, that would be 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting, so that's 40. Moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that.\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, that's 121. Okay, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate that.\n\n3*121 = 363, and then 1 + 363 = 364. So, that's 364. Next layer out is 1 + 3*364. Let's see what that is.\n\n3*364 = 1092, and then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Hmm, that's a big number. Continuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCalculating that: 3*1093. Let me do that step by step. 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute that. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. That's 9841.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. That's 88573.\n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute 3*88573. Breaking it down: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720. So, that's 265720.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer, which is 1 + 3*265720. Let me compute 3*265720. Breaking it down: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding them up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161. So, that's 797161.\n\nFinally, moving out to the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, 3*797161. Let me compute that. Breaking it down: 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. So, 3*797161 = 2391483.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 2,391,483. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that's a pretty big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake along the way.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer was 1 + 3 times the previous result. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or miscount. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, right? Let me count: starting from the innermost, there are nine sets of parentheses. So, each time I computed a layer, I moved one step outward, so after nine layers, I should have the outermost result. But when I started computing, I ended up with 797161, and then multiplied by 3 to get 2,391,483. Hmm, maybe I should recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or add an extra one.\n\nLet me see: the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times ...))). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's list the layers:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, that's only nine layers? But earlier, when I was computing, I went up to 797161, which was the 10th layer? Wait, no, the original expression is 3*(...). So, the innermost is layer 1, then each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from 1 + 3, that's layer 1, then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), and so on, until layer 9, which is the expression inside the outermost 3*(...). So, after layer 9, we have 29524, right? Then, the outermost operation is 3*(layer9), which is 3*29524. Wait, but earlier, I computed up to 797161, which would be layer 10, but there are only 9 layers inside the 3*(...). So, I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3\" is one layer, and each subsequent \"1 + 3(...)\" is another layer. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" expressions. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's one layer. Then, moving out, each time we have another \"1 + 3(...)\", so let's count:\n\n1. 1 + 3 (innermost)\n2. 1 + 3*(1)\n3. 1 + 3*(2)\n4. 1 + 3*(3)\n5. 1 + 3*(4)\n6. 1 + 3*(5)\n7. 1 + 3*(6)\n8. 1 + 3*(7)\n9. 1 + 3*(8)\n10. 1 + 3*(9)\n11. 3*(10)\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the original expression only has nine sets of parentheses. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and the outermost is 3 times that. Let's count the number of layers inside the outermost 3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1)\n3. 1 + 3*(2)\n4. 1 + 3*(3)\n5. 1 + 3*(4)\n6. 1 + 3*(5)\n7. 1 + 3*(6)\n8. 1 + 3*(7)\n9. 1 + 3*(8)\n10. 1 + 3*(9)\n11. 3*(10)\n\nWait, that's 11 layers, but the original expression only has nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses inside the outermost 3(...).\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n10. 3(...))\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way to count. Each time we have \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1)\n3. 1 + 3(2)\n4. 1 + 3(3)\n5. 1 + 3(4)\n6. 1 + 3(5)\n7. 1 + 3(6)\n8. 1 + 3(7)\n9. 1 + 3(8)\n10. 1 + 3(9)\n11. 3(10)\n\nWait, so that's 11 layers, but the original expression only has nine sets of parentheses. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to visualize the expression as a tree. The outermost operation is 3*(something), and that something is 1 + 3*(another something). Each time we have a \"1 + 3*(...)\", that's a new layer. So, let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3, which is the first layer.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is the second layer.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(second layer), which is the third layer.\n\nContinuing this way, each time we have another \"1 + 3*(...)\", it's a new layer.\n\nLooking at the original expression, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur? Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last \"1 + 3\", that's layer 1.\n\nThen, each preceding \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3 (layer 1)\n2. The next is 1 + 3(layer1) (layer 2)\n3. Then 1 + 3(layer2) (layer3)\n4. 1 + 3(layer3) (layer4)\n5. 1 + 3(layer4) (layer5)\n6. 1 + 3(layer5) (layer6)\n7. 1 + 3(layer6) (layer7)\n8. 1 + 3(layer7) (layer8)\n9. 1 + 3(layer8) (layer9)\n10. 1 + 3(layer9) (layer10)\n11. 3(layer10) (outermost)\n\nWait, so that's 11 layers? But the expression only has nine sets of parentheses. I'm getting confused. Maybe I need to count the number of parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses inside the outermost 3(...).\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first opening parenthesis after the first 3, let's count each \"(\": \n\n1. ( after 3\n2. ( after 3\n3. ( after 3\n4. ( after 3\n5. ( after 3\n6. ( after 3\n7. ( after 3\n8. ( after 3\n9. ( after 3\n10. ( after 3\n\nWait, that's 10 opening parentheses, which would mean 10 layers? Hmm, but the innermost is 1 + 3, which is one layer, then each additional \"1 + 3(...)\" adds a layer. So, if there are 10 opening parentheses, that would mean 10 layers inside the outermost 3(...). But that doesn't seem right because the innermost is 1 + 3, which is one layer, and each additional \"1 + 3(...)\" is another layer. So, if there are 9 opening parentheses after the first one, that would make 9 layers inside. Wait, let me recount.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", that's the first layer. Then, each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer. Let's count the number of \"(\":\n\n1. ( after 3\n2. ( after 3\n3. ( after 3\n4. ( after 3\n5. ( after 3\n6. ( after 3\n7. ( after 3\n8. ( after 3\n9. ( after 3\n10. ( after 3\n\nWait, that's 10 \"(\" symbols. So, does that mean there are 10 layers? But the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1, and each additional \"(\" adds a new layer. So, 10 \"(\" would mean 10 layers inside the outermost 3(...). Therefore, the outermost operation is 3*(layer10). So, that would mean that after computing layer10, we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial calculation was correct, and I did compute up to layer9, which was 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, but that doesn't align with my previous steps. Wait, no, in my initial calculation, I went up to 797161, which was layer10, and then multiplied by 3 to get 2,391,483.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me write this with indices to make it clearer:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., Ln, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(L1)\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2)\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3)\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4)\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5)\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6)\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7)\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8)\n\nL10: 1 + 3*(L9)\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*(L10)\n\nSo, that's 10 layers inside the outermost 3(...). Therefore, my initial calculation was correct, and I computed up to L10, which was 797161, and then multiplied by 3 to get 2,391,483.\n\nBut let me double-check the computation for each layer to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nL10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Wait a minute, in my initial calculation, I thought L10 was 797161, but that's incorrect. Wait, no, in my initial step-by-step, I continued beyond L9. Let me see.\n\nWait, in my initial calculation, after L9 was 29524, I continued:\n\nL10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nThen, L11: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nWait, but according to the expression, there are only 10 layers inside the outermost 3(...). So, L10 is 88573, and then the outermost operation is 3*88573 = 265719. Wait, but in my initial calculation, I went up to L10 being 797161, which was incorrect.\n\nWait, I think I confused the layers. Let me start over and compute each layer correctly.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nL10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*88573.\n\nCalculating 3*88573:\n\n3*80,000 = 240,000\n\n3*8,000 = 24,000\n\n3*500 = 1,500\n\n3*70 = 210\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nAdding them up: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719.\n\nSo, 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 265,719.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation where I ended up with 2,391,483. I think I made a mistake earlier by continuing beyond L10, which wasn't part of the original expression. The original expression only has 10 layers inside the outermost 3(...), so after computing L10 as 88573, multiplying by 3 gives 265,719.\n\nLet me verify this by computing step by step again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nL10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nOutermost: 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by computing beyond L10, which wasn't necessary. Therefore, the correct final result is 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers again. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 1 + 3 (innermost)\n2. 1 + 3(1)\n3. 1 + 3(2)\n4. 1 + 3(3)\n5. 1 + 3(4)\n6. 1 + 3(5)\n7. 1 + 3(6)\n8. 1 + 3(7)\n9. 1 + 3(8)\n10. 1 + 3(9)\n11. 3(10)\n\nWait, that's 11 layers again. Hmm, but the expression only has nine sets of parentheses. Wait, no, the expression has nine sets of parentheses inside the outermost 3(...). Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is: 3 followed by a \"(\", then 1 + 3(...). The innermost is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another \"1 + 3(\".\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1 + 3(\" expressions inside the outermost 3(...). Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 (layer1)\n2. 1 + 3(layer1) (layer2)\n3. 1 + 3(layer2) (layer3)\n4. 1 + 3(layer3) (layer4)\n5. 1 + 3(layer4) (layer5)\n6. 1 + 3(layer5) (layer6)\n7. 1 + 3(layer6) (layer7)\n8. 1 + 3(layer7) (layer8)\n9. 1 + 3(layer8) (layer9)\n10. 1 + 3(layer9) (layer10)\n11. 3(layer10) (outermost)\n\nSo, that's 11 layers, but the expression only has nine sets of parentheses inside the outermost 3(...). Therefore, I think my initial approach was wrong because I was counting each \"1 + 3(\" as a new layer, but the expression only has nine sets of parentheses, meaning nine layers inside the outermost 3(...). Therefore, the outermost operation is 3*(layer9). So, let me recount with that in mind.\n\nWait, but looking at the expression, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new set of parentheses, so if there are nine sets of parentheses inside the outermost 3(...), that would mean nine layers. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(L1)\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2)\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3)\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4)\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5)\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6)\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7)\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8)\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*(L9).\n\nSo, that's nine layers inside the outermost 3(...). Therefore, my initial calculation was wrong because I went up to L10, which wasn't part of the original expression.\n\nLet me compute with this correct layer count:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\n3*20,000 = 60,000\n\n3*9,000 = 27,000\n\n3*500 = 1,500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous calculation. So, if the outermost operation is 3*29524, which is 88,572, then the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought there were 10 layers, then 9 layers, and now I'm getting different results. I need to clarify this.\n\nLet me parse the original expression again carefully. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" expressions inside the outermost 3(...). Each \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is the first layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's count how many \"1 + 3(\" are present:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" after the first one adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. After the first 3, we have \"1 + 3(\", that's layer1.\n\n2. Then, inside that, another \"1 + 3(\", that's layer2.\n\n3. Continuing, layer3, layer4, layer5, layer6, layer7, layer8, layer9.\n\nSo, there are 9 \"1 + 3(\" expressions inside the outermost 3(...). Therefore, the layers are L1 to L9, and the outermost operation is 3*(L9).\n\nSo, that means:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought there were 10 layers, I got 265,719, and when I thought there were 9 layers, I got 88,572. Now, I need to confirm which one is correct.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses inside the outermost 3(...). Each \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new opening parenthesis.

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, I see that the innermost part is the last (1+3), right? So, maybe I should start there and work my way outwards. Let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n2. Then, moving one level out, I have 3 times the result of that innermost expression, and then add 1 to it.\n3. I'll keep doing this, moving outward each time, until I reach the outermost parentheses.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. Each time, the structure is 1 + 3*(something). So, each level is 1 plus 3 times the next level. So, if I start from the innermost, I can compute each level step by step.\n\nLet me try to write this out more clearly. Let's define each level starting from the innermost. Let me number the levels from 1 to 9 because there are nine sets of parentheses, I think. Wait, let me count. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), that's level 1. Then each layer wraps around it, so level 2 is 1 + 3*(level1), level3 is 1 + 3*(level2), and so on until level9, which is the outermost. So, I need to compute each level starting from level1 up to level9, and then multiply the outermost by 3, as per the problem statement.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the entire expression is 3 times (the whole nested part). So, the structure is 3*(...), where the ... is the nested 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps I should compute the nested part first, then multiply by 3. But the nested part itself is a series of 1 + 3*(...), so I can compute each level step by step.\n\nLet me try to structure this:\n\nLevel1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel2: 1 + 3*(Level1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel3: 1 + 3*(Level2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel4: 1 + 3*(Level3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel5: 1 + 3*(Level4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel6: 1 + 3*(Level5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel7: 1 + 3*(Level6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel8: 1 + 3*(Level7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel9: 1 + 3*(Level8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Level9). So, the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWell, let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake in the levels. Let me go back step by step to make sure each level is correct.\n\nStarting from Level1: (1 + 3) = 4. That's correct.\n\nLevel2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify once more because I might have made a mistake in the number of levels. Let me count the number of times I see the (1+3) expressions.\n\nLooking at the original problem: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach (1+3) is a level, and each level is wrapped by 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 instances of (1+3). So, from Level1 to Level9, as I did before. So, the computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern that can be generalized, but given that there are only nine levels, computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, each level can be expressed as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value at level n, where n starts at 1 for the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that checks out. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each level is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous level, starting from the innermost parentheses. By computing each level step by step, we find that the innermost level is 4, and each subsequent level builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine levels, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth level, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's define each layer as follows to make it easier:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each innermost expression as E1, E2, and so on, moving outward. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\nE2 = 1 + 3 * E1\nE3 = 1 + 3 * E2\n...\nAnd this continues until E9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.

The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost, each opening parenthesis is followed by a 1 + 3(...).

Finally, E9 = 1 + 3 * E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, the outermost part is 3 * E9. So, let me compute that:\n\nTotal = 3 * E9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check if I did each step correctly because it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go through each step again more carefully.\n\nStarting with E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Right.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3. 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so total 300+60+3=363. Then 1+363=364. Correct.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9.

Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer, maybe there's a geometric progression or something.\n\nLet me think. Each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is E_n^h = A*3^n, and a particular solution can be found as a constant, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant.\n\nAssume a particular solution E_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition E1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo E9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I calculated earlier. Good.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I double-checked each step, and the recurrence formula gives the same result, so I'm confident now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost (E1)**:\n   - E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3 by E9**:\n   - Total = 3 * E9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is 88572.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost part, which is the very last (1 + 3). That's the first part I can compute. Let's do that. \n\nFirst step: Compute the innermost parentheses. So, the innermost is (1 + 3). That equals 4. So now, I can replace that part with 4. So the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. The last (1 + 3) is replaced by 4, so the next layer out is (1 + 3(4)). Let me compute that next. \n\nSecond step: Compute (1 + 3(4)). Well, 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 plus 12 is 13. So now, I can replace that part with 13. So the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))))) Hmm, okay, so each time I compute an innermost parentheses, I replace it with the result and move outward. Let me continue this process step by step.\n\nThird step: Now, compute the next innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3(13)). So, 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 plus 39 is 40. So now, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40))))))) \n\nFourth step: Next, compute (1 + 3(40)). 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So replacing that part: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121)))))) \n\nFifth step: Now, compute (1 + 3(121)). 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364))))) \n\nSixth step: Compute (1 + 3(364)). 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So now, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093)))) \n\nSeventh step: Compute (1 + 3(1093)). 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So now, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280))) \n\nEighth step: Compute (1 + 3(3280)). 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So now, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(9841)) \n\nNinth step: Compute (1 + 3(9841)). 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So now, the expression is: 3(29524) \n\nTenth step: Finally, compute 3 times 29524. Let's do that multiplication. 3 times 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 times 3: 29,524 x 3. \n\nLet me break that down: 20,000 x 3 = 60,000; 9,000 x 3 = 27,000; 500 x 3 = 1,500; 20 x 3 = 60; 4 x 3 = 12. So adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. \n\nSo, 3 times 29,524 equals 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. \n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to get lost in so many parentheses. So starting from the innermost: \n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step, I computed the innermost parentheses first, replaced it, and moved outward. Each time, I multiplied by 3 and added 1, except for the last step where I just multiplied by 3. \n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. \n\nLet me define each term as a sequence. Let's say a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. \n\nIf I can find a general formula for a_n, I might be able to compute it without having to calculate each term step by step. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. \n\nThis recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. \n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. \n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. \n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. \n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. \n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. \n\nNow, let's check if this formula works with our earlier computations. \n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold. Therefore, each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. \n\nIn our problem, how many terms are there? Let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions. Starting from the innermost, which is the first (1 + 3), that's a_1. Then each layer out is a_2, a_3, etc. Let's count: \n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 instances of (1 + 3(...)). So, the innermost is a_1, then a_2, up to a_9. Therefore, the outermost term is 3*a_9. \n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9. \n\nUsing our formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. \n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. \n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. \n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572. \n\nSo, both methods lead me to the same answer, 88,572. That gives me more confidence that this is correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each a_n is one more than three times the previous term. So, it's a geometric progression with a ratio of 3 and an additive constant of 1 each time. The formula we derived accounts for both the geometric growth and the constant addition. \n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute 3^10. 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, 59049 minus 1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524 times 3 is 88,572. \n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. By solving from the innermost parentheses outward, each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Recognizing this as a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form solution which confirms the result. The final computation yields 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is the last \"1+3\" because that's the deepest nested part. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so that part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next step is to compute 1 + 3*(4). Wait, but hold on, is that correct? Let me check the structure again. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the next level). Hmm, so actually, when I move out one level, it's 3*(1 + 3*(previous result)). \n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify the structure. Let me write it down step by step to avoid confusion. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, as I thought. Let's number these levels for clarity. Let's say Level 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then Level 2 is 1 + 3*(Level 1). Level 3 is 1 + 3*(Level 2), and so on, until Level 9, which is the outermost expression, and then finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. \n\nWait, but let me count how many levels there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3)\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4)\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5)\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6)\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7)\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8)\n10. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9)\n\nWait, that seems like 10 levels, but maybe I miscounted. Let me check the original expression again. Each time, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times another term). So, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a level. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis. Then, inside, it's 1 + 3(...). Each time, there's another 3(...) until the innermost part. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1 + 3(\n2. Then another ( inside: (1 + 3(\n3. And another: (1 + 3(\n4. Another: (1 + 3(\n5. Another: (1 + 3(\n6. Another: (1 + 3(\n7. Another: (1 + 3(\n8. Another: (1 + 3(\n9. The last one: (1 + 3))\n\nSo, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning there are 9 levels of nesting. Therefore, the innermost is Level 9, and the outermost is Level 1. So, I need to compute from Level 9 inward, then Level 8, and so on until Level 1, and then multiply by 3. \n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me make sure. So, the innermost is the last (1 + 3), which is Level 1. Then, moving outward, each Level n is 1 + 3*(Level n+1). So, perhaps I should number them from the innermost as Level 1, moving outward. So, Level 1: 1 + 3, Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1), and so on until Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8), and then the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). That makes more sense. So, 9 levels of nesting, starting from Level 1 as the innermost. \n\nSo, let's start computing each level step by step.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait a minute, that seems quite large. Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an error in such a lengthy computation.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or recognize a pattern that might allow me to compute it without calculating each level step by step. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the structure, each level is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value at level n, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n+1} for n >= 2, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nWait, but actually, if I reverse the indices, perhaps it's easier. Let me define L_1 as the innermost level, so L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent level is L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, for k from 2 to 9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_k^h = C*3^{k}.\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_k^p = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_k = C*3^{k} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition: L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nGiven L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nL_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nL_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked my work enough times, and both methods lead to the same conclusion. So, I'm pretty sure that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we can compute each level step by step. \n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result to compute the next level: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each level up to the outermost expression.\n4. After computing each level, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nUsing the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the closed-form formula for the nth level is L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula for k=9, we get L_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last term, which is 1+3. So, that's straightforward. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so the innermost parentheses evaluate to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next part is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so that evaluates to 13. Now, moving another level out, the next expression would be 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. Let's compute that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, that's 40. Continuing this pattern, the next level out would be 1 + 3*40. Let me do that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, 121? That seems a bit high, but okay, let's keep going. The next level would then be 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nHmm, that's getting big. Next, moving another level out, it's 1 + 3*364. Let me see:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWow, 1093. That's a pretty large number. Continuing, the next level is 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nOkay, now another level out, it's 1 + 3*3280. Let me work that out:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nHmm, 9841. That's a big jump. Next, moving out another level, it's 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nAlright, so that's 29524. Now, moving out another level, it's 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute this:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, 88573. That's getting really large. Next, the outermost level before the final multiplication by 3 is 1 + 3*88573. Let me figure that out:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720.\n\nOkay, so that evaluates to 265,720. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times this result. So, I need to compute 3*265,720. Let me do that:\n\nFinal step: 3 * 265,720 = 797,160.\n\nWait, that seems really big. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Maybe I miscalculated one of the intermediate steps. Let me go through each level again more carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720. Correct.\n12. Finally, 3*265,720 = 797,160. \n\nWait, so each step seems correct, but the final number is 797,160. That seems huge, but given that each step multiplies by 3 and adds 1, it's exponential growth, so maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the number of levels. Let me check how many times I went inwards.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a 1+3(...) term. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds another level. Let me count the number of 3s and parentheses.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3). Then each time we move out, we have another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of these 1+3(...) terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nHow many times does this happen? Let me see: Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears nested. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 265,720\n12. Finally, 3*265,720 = 797,160\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me check:\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nFrom the inside:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the 9th one. So, I think I counted 9 levels. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1+3*4 =13\n3. 1+3*13=40\n4. 1+3*40=121\n5. 1+3*121=364\n6. 1+3*364=1093\n7. 1+3*1093=3280\n8. 1+3*3280=9841\n9. 1+3*9841=29524\n10. 1+3*29524=88573\n11. 1+3*88573=265,720\n12. 3*265,720=797,160\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, in my calculation above, I have 11 steps, which would mean 11 layers, but the original expression only has 9. So, I think I must have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me parse the original expression more carefully. It's:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each time moving out, we have another (1+3(...)). So, let's count:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nHow many times? Let's see, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of 1+3 terms. Let me see:\n\nFrom the inside:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another. So, from 1 to 9 layers. So, in my previous calculation, I went up to 11 layers, which is incorrect. Therefore, I must have gone two layers too far.\n\nSo, let me recount, stopping at 9 layers:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 =13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13=40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40=121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121=364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364=1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the result is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this result. So, 3*29,524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29,524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72.\n\nAdding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so that's different from my previous result. So, I think I overcounted the layers before, leading to an incorrect final answer. So, the correct result should be 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check this by counting the number of layers again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me write it with indices to count the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers inside the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, my initial mistake was counting two extra layers, which led me to an incorrect final answer. So, the correct answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such recursions.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1.\n\nIn this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c=3, d=1.\n\nSo, the solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1).\n\nBut wait, actually, the standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, which is our case with c=3, d=1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)} = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 =4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers (from layer 1 to layer 9). So, n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, using the formula, I also get 88,572 as the final result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested recurrence relation that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards or by recognizing the pattern and using the formula for such a recurrence. Each layer follows the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For 9 layers, a_9 = 29,524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
