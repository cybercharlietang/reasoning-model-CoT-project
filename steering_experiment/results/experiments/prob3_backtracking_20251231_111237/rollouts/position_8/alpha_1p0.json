    "text": " Let me count how many layers there are. Let me see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer wraps another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of 3s or the number of layers. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3(....) So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). Each time, inside the parentheses, it's another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times this happens. Let me see: starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3*(...), and this continues. Let me count the number of 3s. Hmm, actually, each layer is a 3 multiplied by a term that starts with 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps it's 8 layers deep? Let me check:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n2. Then, wrapping that, it's 1+3*(1+3).\n3. Then, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)).\n4. Continuing this, each time adding another layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3s after each 1. Let me write it out:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the innermost is 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: the original expression is 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and that inner part is 1 + 3*(...), and so on until the innermost is 1 + 3. So, how many times does 1 + 3 occur? Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3\" in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" occurrences. Let's see:\n\n- The first is 3(1+3(\n- Then inside that, 1+3(\n- Then another 1+3(\n- And so on, until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of times 3 is multiplied by something. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. That might be more straightforward.\n\nSo, let me try that. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nInnermost layer: L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, the next layer out is L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nThen, L3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, until we reach the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, if I can compute L1, then L2, then L3, etc., each time using the previous result, I can work my way out.\n\nLet me see how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"1+3(\" inside each other, starting from the innermost. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3. Then, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, we have 8 opening parentheses. Wait, let me check:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(\n- Then, inside that, another (1+3(\n- And so on, until the innermost is 1+3.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 8. Wait, because the innermost is 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3*(...), so starting from 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3s after each 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of times we have 1+3*(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n4. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n5. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n6. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))\n8. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))\n\nWait, that's 8 layers. So, starting from L1 = 1+3, then L2 = 1+3*L1, up to L8 = 1+3*L7. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L8). So, I need to compute L1 through L8 and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 9 layers? Wait, no, because the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3\n- Then, one layer out is 1+3*(1+3)\n- Then, another layer is 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n- Continuing this, each time adding another 1+3*(...).\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression. Let's see:\n\nFrom the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"1+3(\" after the first 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- After the first 3, we have (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, that's 8 opening parentheses after the first 3, which means 8 layers. Therefore, the innermost is L1 = 1+3, then L2 = 1+3*L1, up to L8 = 1+3*L7. Then, the entire expression is 3*L8.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me count the number of 3s in the expression. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 3 multiplied by a term that starts with 1+3. So, each layer adds another 3. So, perhaps the number of layers is 8, as I thought before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 9 layers because the innermost is 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3*(...), so from the innermost to the outermost, it's 8 layers. Hmm, perhaps I should just start computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let's define L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, up to L8, and then the entire expression is 3*L8.\n\nLet me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L8 = 3*9841 = ?\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3*9841.\n\nCompute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000*3 = 27,000\n\n800*3 = 2,400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nAdding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nSo, the total is 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a large number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, let's go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThen, 3*L8 = 3*9841 = 29,523\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check L7 again because 3*1093 is 3279, and 1 + 3279 is 3280. Then, L8 is 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Then, 3*9841 is indeed 29,523.\n\nBut wait, let me think again: is the number of layers correct? Because the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers is that? Let me count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nWait, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n4. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n5. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n6. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))\n8. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))\n\nWait, so that's 8 layers, right? So, L1 to L8, as I did before. So, the computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nBut let me see if I can find a pattern by computing the first few terms:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nWait, so L1 = 4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841.\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.\n\nSo, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L8 = (3^{9} -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 =19682/2=9841, as we computed earlier.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*L8 = 3*9841=29,523.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then L8 = (3^9 -1)/2=9841, as above.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*9841=29,523.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the calculations.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^9 to confirm:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\nYes, 3^9 is 19683.\n\nSo, (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841.\n\nThen, 9841*3=29,523.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 29,523.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step. Each layer follows the pattern \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\). We compute up to \\( L_8 \\) and then multiply by 3.\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_8 = 3 \\times 9841 = 29523 \\).\n\n$\\boxed{29523}$"

    "text": " Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, the innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, substituting the previous result, which was 4, it becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level is 13. Now, moving out another level, the expression is again (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, substituting 13, it becomes (1 + 3*13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, now we have 40. Moving out another level, it's (1 + 3*40). Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, next level is 121. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, the result is getting larger, and it seems like each step is multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Let me check that. If I denote each step as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, and so on. So, each term is generated by the formula a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That seems correct. Now, I need to figure out how many levels deep this expression goes. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count them: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each time there's a 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of 3s: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3. Wait, that's nine 3s. But each 3 is part of a term, so does that mean there are nine layers? Let me check: Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see: The first 3 is outside, then inside it's (1 + 3(...)), so that's the first layer. Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), that's the second layer, and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times I see a \"1 + 3(\" in the expression. Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3), then moving out, each time I see another 1 + 3(. So, let's see: The innermost is (1 + 3), that's one. Then each subsequent layer adds another one. Let me count the number of closing parentheses: There are nine closing parentheses at the end. So, that suggests there are nine layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9, and then the outermost 3 multiplies the result of layer 9. So, in total, we have a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, and so on, up to a_9, and then the final result is 3*a_9. So, I need to compute up to a_9 and then multiply by 3. Let me try to compute each a_n step by step. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, a_9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(a_9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000 3*9000 = 27000 3*500 = 1500 3*24 = 72 So, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from a_1: 4, correct. a_2: 1 + 12 = 13, correct. a_3: 1 + 39 = 40, correct. a_4: 1 + 120 = 121, correct. a_5: 1 + 363 = 364, correct. a_6: 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. a_7: 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. a_8: 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. a_9: 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute it another way to verify. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, I think I did it correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each step is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.

So, maybe I can compute each innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1+3), right? So, that's the first one to compute. Let me count the number of 3s to make sure. Starting from the left, each opening parenthesis has a 3 multiplied by the next expression. So, let me see: starting from the left, the first term is 3 times (1 + ...), then inside that, another 3 times (1 + ...), and so on, until the innermost part. How many times does 3 get multiplied? Let's count the number of 3s. Each time, we have a 3 multiplied by an expression, so the number of multiplications by 3 is equal to the number of parentheses minus one, maybe? Let's see: starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by the first (1 + ...), then inside that, another 3, and so on. Let me count the number of 3s: 3, then another 3, another 3, another 3, another 3, another 3, another 3, another 3, and then the innermost is (1+3). So, that's 8 multiplications by 3, right? Because each (1 + 3(...)) introduces another multiplication by 3. Wait, no, actually, each time we have a 3 multiplied by an expression, so starting from the innermost, we have (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, maybe the number of layers is 9, starting from (1+3) as the innermost. So, perhaps the number of multiplications by 3 is 8, since each layer after the first adds a multiplication by 3. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should approach it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, so that's the first step. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3*(innermost result) + 1. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps I should define each layer as starting from the innermost and working outwards. Let me try to write each step clearly.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let's check: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Okay, moving on.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3*(L9). Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing L9, which is 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Let me recount the layers. Each time, we have a layer that's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from L1 = (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 3*29524:\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000.\n\n3*9000 = 27000.\n\n3*500 = 1500.\n\n3*20 = 60.\n\n3*4 = 12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers.\n\nStarting from L1: (1+3)=4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4=13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40=121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121=364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming L_n^{(p)} = D, a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D=1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition L1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nFor n=1, L1= (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L9=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I can't spot any errors in the calculations. Each step seems to follow logically, and the recurrence relation approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By iteratively computing each layer, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.

So, starting from the inside, let's compute each layer step by step. Let me count how many layers there are. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and I see that there are nine sets of parentheses, so I think there are nine layers. Let me confirm that. Starting from the innermost: 1+3(1+3(...)) so each time I go out one layer, I add another 1+3(...). So, let's start with the innermost parentheses. The innermost expression is 1+3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving outward again, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. Continuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that layer is 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, that's 364. Moving outward again: 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that layer is 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that layer is 3280. Moving outward again: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that layer is 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123, so adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that layer is 29524. Now, moving outward again: 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that layer is 88573. Now, the next layer: 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute 3*88573. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*73 is 219. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 219 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. So, that layer is 265720. Now, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(265720). Let me compute 3*265720. 3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*720 is 2160. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2160 is 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 is 797161. So, the outermost layer is 797161. Now, the entire expression is 3 times this outermost result, right? Because the original expression is 3*(all that stuff). So, the final step is to compute 3*797161. Let me do that. 3*700000 is 2100000, 3*90000 is 270000, 3*7000 is 21000, 3*100 is 300, 3*60 is 180, 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 2100000 + 270000 is 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. So, 3*797161 is 2391483. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 2,391,483. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4.

Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result, which was 13. So, 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. Continuing this way, the next expression is 1 + 3*40. Let's do that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121.

Let's compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9524 is let's see, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*524 is 1572, so 27000 + 1572 is 28572. So, adding that to 60000 gives us 60000 + 28572 = 88572.

Adding 1 gives us 265720. So, the next result is 265720. Now, moving to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*265720.

Adding 1 gives us 797161. So, the next result is 797161. Now, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, 3*797161.

    "text": " Let me write down the expression to visualize it better. The innermost part is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by something. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost parentheses equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). The previous result was 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate that: 3*364 is... well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093.\n\nMoving outward again, we have 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I went too far. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(...))) and I count nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, which was 1+3=4, each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and adds 1. So, let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't go beyond.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3 = 4\n2. 1+3*4 = 13\n3. 1+3*13 = 40\n4. 1+3*40 = 121\n5. 1+3*121 = 364\n6. 1+3*364 = 1093\n7. 1+3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1+3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1+3*9841 = ?\n\nWait, so after 8 layers, I was at 9841, which is the 9th layer. But the original expression is 3 times that entire expression. So, the outermost operation is 3*(1+3*(...)). So, actually, the expression is 3*(result after 9 layers). Let me clarify that.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me write down the structure:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, let me count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = ?\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, we have 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841. Let's see, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is 3 times this result. So, the outermost operation is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524. 29000*3 is 87000, 524*3 is 1572. So, 87000 + 1572 is 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems quite large. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting over, let's compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524. Let's compute that:\n\n3*29524:\n\nFirst, break it down:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nWait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Let me check:\n\n20000 + 9000 = 29000\n\n29000 + 500 = 29500\n\n29500 + 24 = 29524. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this because the numbers are getting quite big, and I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLet me verify each step:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say that each term is defined as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nwith a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, if I compute a_1 to a_9, that should give me the value inside the outermost 3*().\n\nLet me compute a_1 to a_9 using this recurrence relation.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Since the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524\n\nSo, the innermost expression is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29000*3=87000\n\nCompute 524*3=1572\n\nAdd them together: 87000 + 1572=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as a term in a sequence where each term is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\n\\[ a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\]\n\nwith the initial condition \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\nWe compute each term step by step:\n\n1. \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then 3 times this result:\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to visualize this. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost and moving outwards. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time I go out, I add another layer. Let me count: the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent is another 1+3(...). Let's see: the innermost is 1+3, then 1+3*(innermost), then 1+3*(previous), and so on. Let me count the number of times this happens. Starting from the innermost: 1. 1+3 = 4. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(4). Then, next layer is 1 + 3*(result of previous). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. Wait, no, actually, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), so each layer is a new (1 + 3(...)). Let me count how many times this happens. From the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of closing parentheses. Each ( corresponds to a ), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's one layer, then each time we go out, another layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses. The entire expression ends with 9 closing parentheses, but actually, each (1+3(...)) is a layer. Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps it with 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Let me write them out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9, perhaps? Because the expression ends with 9 closing parentheses, so maybe there are 9 layers. Wait, let me check. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3) is a layer, and each subsequent layer wraps it. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions. Let me see: the innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, the first layer is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3 inside each parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to start from the innermost and compute each layer step by step. Let's do that.\n\nLet me assign each layer a number, starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, since I think there are 9 layers. Let me confirm that. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time we go out, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the first layer is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n- After the first 3, the first ( is for the first layer: 1+3(...)\n- Then, inside that, another ( for the second layer: 1+3(...)\n- And so on, until the ninth layer, which is just 1+3.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then, each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers? Let me see: the expression ends with 9 closing parentheses, so perhaps 9 layers. Let me check: starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check a couple of layers again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or some pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from a base case, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSubstitute the assumed form:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1:\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 59049*3 = 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous term). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the result of the inner expression. There are 9 layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times\\) the result of Layer 9, which is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

The something is another 3 times another similar expression. So maybe each time I can compute the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me try to count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's the first layer.\n2. Then, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from layer 1).\n3. Each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the first one after the 3, each layer adds another set. Let me count:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so that's one layer.\n- Each subsequent 3 is another layer. Let me see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), so that's layer 1.\n2. Then, 1 + 3*(layer 1) is layer 2.\n3. Next, 1 + 3*(layer 2) is layer 3.\n4. Continuing this way, I can count each layer until I reach the outermost one.\n\nWait, let me actually count the number of 3s after each 1. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after a 1, there's a 3 and another set of parentheses. Let me see how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), so that's one 3 after 1.\n- Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 3 after 1. So, let me count the number of 3s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times the pattern 1 + 3(...) appears. Let me see:\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me see how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), and inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) \u2192 1 layer\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) \u2192 2 layers\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) \u2192 3 layers\n4. Continuing this way, each time adding another layer.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there in total? Let me count the number of times 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis.\n\nStarting from the first 3 after the initial 3:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so that's one layer.\n- Then, inside that, another 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), so that's two layers.\n- Continuing until the innermost (1 + 3), which is the ninth layer? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. The first opening parenthesis after the first 3 starts the first layer.\n2. Then, inside that, another opening parenthesis starts the second layer.\n3. Continuing until the innermost opening parenthesis, which is the ninth layer.\n\nWait, actually, each time after a 3, there's an opening parenthesis, so let me count how many times that happens.\n\nStarting from the first 3 after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 1\n2. Then, inside that, 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 2\n3. And so on until the innermost, which would be the 8th layer? Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to count the number of 3s after each 1. Let me look again:\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(...). So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: because I can see that from the expression, there are nine layers of 3*(...). Let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 3 is followed by another layer. Let me count the number of 3s after each 1:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), so that's one 3 after 1.\n- The next layer is (1 + 3*(1 + 3)), so that's two 3s after 1s.\n- Wait, no, each layer adds a 3 after a 1, but each time it's a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, let me try to count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the initial 3 is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 1\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 2\n3. Then another \u2192 3\n4. Then another \u2192 4\n5. Then another \u2192 5\n6. Then another \u2192 6\n7. Then another \u2192 7\n8. Then another \u2192 8\n9. Then another \u2192 9\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 9: (1 + 3), then layer 8 is 1 + 3*(layer 9), and so on up to layer 1, which is the outermost expression, and then the entire expression is 3*(layer 1). Hmm, that might be the way to approach it.\n\nWait, but actually, the entire expression is 3*(layer 1), where layer 1 is (1 + 3*(layer 2)), and so on until layer 9 is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, perhaps I should compute each layer starting from layer 9 and moving outward.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L9 is the innermost, and L1 is the outermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L9\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L8\n\n...\n\nL1 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*L1.\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L9:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L8 = 1 + 3*L9 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL1 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L1 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me verify each step because that's a lot of multiplication, and it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n- 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Hmm, that also checks out.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Because if I have 9 layers, starting from L9 as the innermost, then L1 is the outermost, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so that would be 3*L1, which we've calculated as 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me make sure that the number of layers is correct. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...\n2. (1 + 3(...\n3. (1 + 3(...\n4. (1 + 3(...\n5. (1 + 3(...\n6. (1 + 3(...\n7. (1 + 3(...\n8. (1 + 3(...\n9. (1 + 3)\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers, each adding a new (1 + 3(...)).\n\nTherefore, my calculation of L1 through L9 seems correct, leading to the final answer of 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe using a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or solved using a formula. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if we have n layers, the value would be (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, actually, for the expression x = 1 + 3x, solving for x gives x = (1)/(3 - 1) = 1/2, but that's for an infinite series. But in our case, it's a finite number of layers, so the formula would be different.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a finite geometric series. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I have k layers, the value would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nWait, let me try to express it recursively.\n\nLet me define Lk as the value of the k-th layer, where Lk = 1 + 3*Lk+1, with L9 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, L9 is the innermost, so L9 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, L8 = 1 + 3*L9\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L8\n\n...\n\nL1 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L1.\n\nSo, if I have 9 layers, starting from L9, then L1 is the outermost.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nAlternatively, I can write a general formula for Lk in terms of Lk+1.\n\nLet me try to express Lk as:\n\nLk = 1 + 3*Lk+1\n\nWith L9 = 4.\n\nSo, L8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAlternatively, we can express Lk in terms of Lk+1, and so on, up to L9.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for Lk.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is Lk = 1 + 3*Lk+1, with L9 = 4.\n\nLet me write down the terms:\n\nL9 = 4\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL1 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each Lk can be expressed as Lk = (3^(10) - 1)/2 ?\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nWait, 3^10 is 59049.\n\n(59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is exactly L1.\n\nSo, L1 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L1 = 3*(3^10 - 1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^11 is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, that's a good check. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, let me make sure that the formula applies here.\n\nIn general, for a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and there are n layers, the outermost layer would be L1 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9, so L1 = (3^(10) - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L1 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a finite geometric series, since each layer is multiplied by 3, the total expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's overcomplicating it since we've already computed it step by step and verified it with the formula.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make absolutely sure, let me compute L1 again using the formula and then multiply by 3.\n\nL1 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\n3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\), and there are nine such layers.

    "text": " Let me try to write this out step by step. The innermost part is 1+3, right? So that's the first part. Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so the innermost parentheses simplify to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So now, that middle part is 13. Next, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So now, that layer simplifies to 40. Continuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3 times 40. So 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. That's getting bigger each time. Next, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. Hmm, that's a pretty big number. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 is 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093. Wow, that's almost a thousand. Next, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*1093. Let's do the math: 3*1093 is... let's see, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Okay, that's another big jump. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. Well, 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Wow, that's a huge number. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate that. 3*9841... Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. That's really big. Now, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So that's the result of the innermost expression. Now, going back to the original problem, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, putting it all together, the final result is 265,719. Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1+3=4. Then, each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous result). I calculated each step carefully, but maybe I missed a step or miscalculated a multiplication somewhere. Let me go through the layers again quickly: 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524, 1+3*29524=88573. Then, 3*88573=265,719. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I did each multiplication step correctly, so I'm confident that the final answer is 265,719.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer simplifies to a value that is used in the next outer layer. After computing each step carefully, the final result is found by multiplying the outermost value by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Substitute back into the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n3. Continue substituting and simplifying each layer:\n   - 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n   - 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n4. Multiply the final value by 3: 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{265719}$"

    "text": " Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, there are nine sets of parentheses here, each containing 1 plus 3 times another set. Wait, no, let me count. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3 times a term. Let me count the number of 3s: Each layer adds another 3(1 + ...), so starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each step adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. Next: (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see, the innermost is step 1, then each subsequent step adds another layer. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses inside the first 3. Wait, maybe I should count the number of 3s. Let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). Inside that, it's 3 multiplied by another (1 + ...), and so on. Let me count the number of 3s inside the expression. Each time, there's a 3 multiplied by a term. So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many 3s are there? Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 3)\n- Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n- Then, 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n- Continuing this way, each time adding another layer.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see, the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, the expression is 3 followed by 9 sets of (1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), and each layer before that adds another 3*(...). So, perhaps there are 9 layers. Wait, no, let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many times does the pattern repeat? Let's count the number of 3s after the initial 3.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by working from the inside out. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + 3*(innermost result)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, but hold on, that might not be the correct approach. Let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, but that seems inconsistent. Let me try to outline each step clearly.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9). Because the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...), which is 3*L9.\n\nSo, the total would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nFinally, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 Total so far: 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each L1 to L9 corresponds to each layer, and the outermost is 3*L9. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4 (which is the innermost term). Then, each subsequent term is built upon the previous one.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThat seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant C, so substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCalculating 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost term is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the recurrence approach. Let me check a few terms:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nL3 =1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nL4=1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nL5=1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nL6=1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nL7=1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nL8=1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nL9=1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each term a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} ?\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly correct. Because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see:\n\nWait, if I expand a_n, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to n terms. But actually, since each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, when expanded, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but in our case, n=9, so a_9 would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9. Let's check that.\n\nSum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k is (3^{10} -1)/(3 -1) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which matches a_9=29524. So yes, a_n is the sum of a geometric series up to 3^{n}.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that's another way to see it. So, each a_n is the sum of the geometric series up to 3^{n}, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term.

Let me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Yep, nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), and working my way outwards. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 3*(innermost result). Let me write that down.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*4 = 12\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have (1 + Layer 8). So, that's 1 + 12.

Let's say:\n\nLet a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original problem only has nine layers, so a\u2089 would be the innermost, and then we have to multiply by 3 again. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) terms. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied, which is 9 times, so 9 layers. So, perhaps my a\u2081 to a\u2089 correspond to each layer. Let me try that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index the layers from the inside out. So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. Let me try that.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer 3: (1 + Layer 2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 5: (1 + Layer 4) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 7: (1 + Layer 6) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer 9: (1 + Layer 8) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364.\n\nWait, so that would mean the total is 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. So, the result is 1092.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again because I might have made a miscalculation. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 3*4 = 12\n3. Layer 3: (1 + 12) = 13\n4. Layer 4: 3*13 = 39\n5. Layer 5: (1 + 39) = 40\n6. Layer 6: 3*40 = 120\n7. Layer 7: (1 + 120) = 121\n8. Layer 8: 3*121 = 363\n9. Layer 9: (1 + 363) = 364\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*364. Let's compute that:\n\n364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1092 is the result.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if I have nine layers correctly. Each time I do a layer, it alternates between (1 + previous) and 3*previous. Let me count how many times I have (1 + ...) and 3*... in my steps.\n\nFrom Layer 1 to Layer 9, I have:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 12) =13\n\nLayer 4:3*13=39\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 39)=40\n\nLayer 6:3*40=120\n\nLayer7: (1 + 120)=121\n\nLayer8:3*121=363\n\nLayer9: (1 + 363)=364\n\nSo, that's nine layers, ending with (1 + 363)=364. Then, the outermost operation is 3*(364), which is 1092.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when I count layers, I might miscount the number. Let me see: each time I have a (1 + 3*(...)), that's one layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each step outwards adds another 3*(...). So, let me see how many times 3*(...) appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), then each time we have 3*(1+3*(...)), so each 3*(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3*(...) terms.\n\nLet me parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let's count the number of times 3*(...) appears:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, the next is 3*(1 + ...)\n3. Then another 3*(1 + ...)\n4. Continuing until we reach the outermost 3*(...)\n\nSo, how many 3*(...) are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), which is 9 layers deep. So, perhaps there are 9 layers of 3*(...). Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_i, where i is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but that would mean the outermost expression is 3*a_9, right? So, 3*29524 = 88572. But that's different from the 1092 I calculated earlier. Hmm, I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me see: in the original expression, how many times does 3*(...) occur? Let me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...) terms.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nEach time after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, the first 3 is outside, then the first (1 + 3(...)) is the next layer, and so on. So, how many times does 3*(...) occur?\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1 + 3( ... )):\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is a_1 = 4\n\n2. Then, moving out, we have 3*(a_1) = 3*4 = 12, which is part of the next layer: (1 + 12) =13\n\n3. Then, 3*(13) = 39, which is part of (1 + 39) =40\n\nContinuing this way, each layer is built upon the previous.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the outermost 3 is part of the layers or not. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nThe entire expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each time we have a 3*(...). So, the number of 3*(...) operations is equal to the number of layers, which is 9. So, perhaps a_1 to a_9 correspond to each of these operations, and then the outermost 3 is applied to a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had a_9 as 29524, which would make the total 3*29524 = 88572. But when I computed step by step from the innermost, I ended up with 1092. Clearly, there's a discrepancy here. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nThat's one opening parenthesis, then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on. So, how many times do we have (1 + 3(...) inside?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. The first (1 + 3(...) is the innermost.\n\n2. Then, inside that, another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nContinuing until we reach the outermost (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, each corresponding to a 3*(...) operation. So, let's try to compute each layer as a_i, where a_1 is the innermost, and a_9 is the outermost before the final multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index the layers starting from the innermost as a_1, then a_2, up to a_9, and then the outermost 3*a_9.\n\nLet me try that:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 =40\n\na_4 =1 + 3*a_3=1 + 120=121\n\na_5 =1 + 3*a_4=1 + 363=364\n\na_6 =1 + 3*a_5=1 + 1092=1093\n\na_7 =1 + 3*a_6=1 + 3279=3280\n\na_8 =1 + 3*a_7=1 + 9840=9841\n\na_9 =1 + 3*a_8=1 + 29523=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed from the innermost as layer 1, I ended up with 3*364=1092, which is different. So, which one is correct?\n\nI think the confusion arises from how I'm counting the layers. Let me try to parse the original expression more carefully. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...) terms. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so each of these is a new layer. Let's see how many times this occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) =4\n\n2. 3*(4)=12\n\n3. (1 +12)=13\n\n4. 3*(13)=39\n\n5. (1 +39)=40\n\n6. 3*(40)=120\n\n7. (1 +120)=121\n\n8. 3*(121)=363\n\n9. (1 +363)=364\n\n10. 3*(364)=1092\n\nWait, so perhaps the outermost expression is the 10th step, but in the original problem, there are nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, maybe I'm overcounting.\n\nWait, let me see: each time we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of 3*(1 + ...) terms is 9, meaning that the outermost layer is the 9th, and then the entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result of the 9th layer.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had a_9 as 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572, but when I computed step by step, I got 1092. So, clearly, I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each time I have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), that's a new layer, so the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost as layer 1. So, let's try again:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) =4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(4)=12\n\nLayer 3: (1 +12)=13\n\nLayer 4:3*(13)=39\n\nLayer5:(1 +39)=40\n\nLayer6:3*(40)=120\n\nLayer7:(1 +120)=121\n\nLayer8:3*(121)=363\n\nLayer9:(1 +363)=364\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(364)=1092.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, in this case, the number of layers where we have 3*(...) is 9, but the outermost operation is also a 3*(...), so perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, no, in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So, each time, we have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)) operation. So, let me try to model it as a recurrence relation where each term is defined as 1 + 3*previous term, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define a_1 as the innermost (1 +3)=4\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 +3*a_1 =13\n\na_3=1 +3*a_2=40\n\na_4=1 +3*a_3=121\n\na_5=1 +3*a_4=364\n\na_6=1 +3*a_5=1093\n\na_7=1 +3*a_6=3280\n\na_8=1 +3*a_7=9841\n\na_9=1 +3*a_8=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572\n\nBut when I computed step by step earlier, I ended up with 1092, which is 3*364, where 364 is a_5.\n\nSo, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to parse the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 +3), then each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each of these is a layer. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) operations.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 +3)=4\n\n2. 3*(4)=12\n\n3. (1 +12)=13\n\n4. 3*(13)=39\n\n5. (1 +39)=40\n\n6. 3*(40)=120\n\n7. (1 +120)=121\n\n8. 3*(121)=363\n\n9. (1 +363)=364\n\n10. 3*(364)=1092\n\nWait, so in this case, the outermost operation is the 10th step, which is 3*364=1092. But the original problem only has nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps I'm counting the outermost 3 as a separate layer, but actually, it's the same as the other layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is because the initial 3 is outside the first (1 + 3*(...)), so the number of 3*(...) operations is nine, and the outermost 3 is applied after those nine layers. So, perhaps the total number of layers is nine, and the outermost 3 is the 10th step.\n\nBut when I computed step by step, I ended up with 1092, which is 3*364, where 364 is the result after nine layers. So, perhaps the correct answer is 1092.\n\nBut then, when I computed using the recurrence relation up to a_9, I got 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572, which is different. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that I'm including the initial 3 as a layer, but it's not part of the nested 3*(1 + ...) terms. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, the first operation is 3*(...), where the ... is (1 + 3*(...)), which itself is another layer. So, each time, we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and this occurs nine times, with the innermost being (1 +3)=4.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to have nine layers where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, let's try that:\n\nLet me define a_1 as the innermost (1 +3)=4\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + a_i), where i starts from 1.\n\nWait, but that would mean:\n\na_1 = (1 +3)=4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) =3*(1+4)=15\n\nWait, but that's different from before. Hmm, perhaps I'm misdefining the recurrence.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct recurrence is a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting from a_1=1.\n\nWait, but in the expression, each layer is (1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a_1=1.\n\nWait, let me test that:\n\nIf a_1=1\n\na_2=1 +3*a_1=1+3=4\n\na_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +12=13\n\na_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +39=40\n\na_5=1 +3*a_4=1 +120=121\n\na_6=1 +3*a_5=1 +363=364\n\na_7=1 +3*a_6=1 +1092=1093\n\na_8=1 +3*a_7=1 +3279=3280\n\na_9=1 +3*a_8=1 +9840=9841\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*9841=29523\n\nWait, but that's not matching with my earlier step-by-step. So, perhaps I'm misdefining the recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence should start with a_1=4, as the innermost (1+3)=4, then each a_i=3*(1 + a_{i-1})\n\nWait, let's try that:\n\na_1=4\n\na_2=3*(1 + a_1)=3*(5)=15\n\na_3=3*(1 + a_2)=3*(16)=48\n\na_4=3*(1 + a_3)=3*(49)=147\n\na_5=3*(1 + a_4)=3*(148)=444\n\na_6=3*(1 + a_5)=3*(445)=1335\n\na_7=3*(1 + a_6)=3*(1336)=4008\n\na_8=3*(1 + a_7)=3*(4009)=12027\n\na_9=3*(1 + a_8)=3*(12028)=36084\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*36084=108252\n\nWait, that's different again. Clearly, I'm not defining the recurrence correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of each layer as a_i=1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting from a_1=1.\n\nSo, a_1=1\n\na_2=1 +3*1=4\n\na_3=1 +3*4=13\n\na_4=1 +3*13=40\n\na_5=1 +3*40=121\n\na_6=1 +3*121=364\n\na_7=1 +3*364=1093\n\na_8=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na_9=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*9841=29523\n\nBut this contradicts my earlier step-by-step where I ended up with 1092.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Let me try to compute the expression step by step from the innermost parentheses, as I did initially.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: (1 +3)=4\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 3*(result from inner layer) +1.\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(previous result). Wait, no, let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 +3)=4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1)=3*(1 +4)=15\n\nWait, but that doesn't match my earlier step-by-step.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misapplying the operations. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is (1 + 3*(...)), so starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 +3)=4\n\nLayer 2: (1 +3*Layer1)=1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3: (1 +3*Layer2)=1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4: (1 +3*Layer3)=1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5: (1 +3*Layer4)=1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6: (1 +3*Layer5)=1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7: (1 +3*Layer6)=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8: (1 +3*Layer7)=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9: (1 +3*Layer8)=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572\n\nBut when I computed step by step earlier, I ended up with 3*364=1092, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that I'm not correctly identifying the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each (1 + 3*(...) is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are nine layers of (1 + 3*(...)), each nested inside the previous one. So, each of these is a new layer, meaning that the innermost is Layer1: (1 +3)=4\n\nThen, Layer2: (1 +3*Layer1)=13\n\nLayer3: (1 +3*Layer2)=40\n\nLayer4: (1 +3*Layer3)=121\n\nLayer5: (1 +3*Layer4)=364\n\nLayer6: (1 +3*Layer5)=1093\n\nLayer7: (1 +3*Layer6)=3280\n\nLayer8: (1 +3*Layer7)=9841\n\nLayer9: (1 +3*Layer8)=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*Layer9=88572\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I only went up to Layer9 as 364, which seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me try to compute each layer step by step again, carefully.\n\nStarting with Layer1: (1 +3)=4\n\nLayer2: (1 +3*Layer1)=1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3: (1 +3*Layer2)=1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4: (1 +3*Layer3)=1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5: (1 +3*Layer4)=1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6: (1 +3*Layer5)=1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7: (1 +3*Layer6)=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8: (1 +3*Layer7)=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9: (1 +3*Layer8)=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, that would mean the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed step by step, I thought I had nine layers ending at 364, but that must have been a miscount. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I had nine layers, but I stopped at Layer5, which is 364, and then multiplied by 3 to get 1092, but that's incorrect because there are actually nine layers, so I need to go all the way to Layer9.\n\nWait, so to confirm, each layer is built upon the previous one, and there are nine layers inside the initial 3*(...). Therefore, the correct computation is up to Layer9, resulting in 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut then, why did I get 1092 earlier? Because I must have miscounted the number of layers, stopping at Layer5 instead of Layer9.\n\nWait, let me verify the number of layers by counting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nEach (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...) terms:\n\n1. (1 +3(...)) at the first level after the initial 3.\n\n2. Inside that, another (1 +3(...)).\n\nContinuing until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3(1 + 3(...) terms"

Starting from the left, each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", so maybe each set is a layer. Let me see how many layers there are. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Hmm, each time there's a \"1 + 3(...)\", so each of those is a layer. Let me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, nine layers in total. That means I need to compute the innermost one first and then work my way out. So, let me start from the innermost part. The innermost part is at the very end: 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3 times the result from the innermost layer. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so that's 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3 times the previous result.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, 40. Let me keep going. Next layer:\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n121. Wow, that's getting big. Next layer:\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n364. Alright, moving out another layer:\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n1093. That's a pretty large number. Next layer:\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n3280. Continuing outward:\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9841. Wow, that's massive. Now, moving out to the last layer:\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n29524. So, that's the result of the innermost expression working out to the ninth layer. Now, remember, the entire original expression is 3 times that result. So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by 29524. Let me compute that.\n\n10. Final step: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me calculate 3 * 29524. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000.\n\nThen, 3 * 9000 = 27000.\n\nNext, 3 * 500 = 1500.\n\nThen, 3 * 20 = 60.\n\nAnd finally, 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be straightforward. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, but let me confirm using another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet's add 29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10, carry over 1.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, plus 1 is 19, carry over 1.\n\n2 + 2 = 4, plus 1 is 5.\n\nSo, 59048.\n\nNow, adding another 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 + 29524.\n\nLet's add:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6, plus 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7, plus 1 = 8.\n\nSo, 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each step again to verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. All steps seem correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a nested structure where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each layer is a linear function of the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, which is 29524.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me think. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is nonhomogeneous.\n\nThe standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1\n\n-2*K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with the initial terms to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince our original problem has 9 layers, the innermost being n=1, the outermost being n=9, so the value after all the parentheses is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times this value, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. That might be faster if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the formula in case the number of layers is more, say 20 or something, which would be tedious to compute step by step.\n\nWait, but let me check that formula again. So, the formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWhich is (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the exponents.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^{11} is indeed 177147, and subtracting 3 gives 177144, which divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't use the formula, and just computed each layer step by step, I still got the same result, so that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n7.

Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Then, each layer wraps around that with another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's number each layer from the inside out. So, the innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3) Then Layer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1 Wait, no, actually, looking again, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is just (1 + 3). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Then Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13: that's 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me keep going to see if I can spot a trend or maybe find a formula. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, finally, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, no, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.

Okay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, so it's 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives 13. So the next level out is 13. Now, moving one more level out, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So that's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3 times 13 is 39, and adding 1 gives 40. So that level is 40. Hmm, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, adding 1, and then that becomes the new result. Wait, but in the original problem, each term is 1 + 3 times the next term, so maybe I can model this as a sequence where each term depends on the next. Let me think about that. Let me denote each level as a_n, where n is the level from the inside. So starting from the innermost, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as I had before.

Let me compute 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1092 + 1 is 1093. So a_6 is 1093. Next, a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then adding 1 gives 3280. So a_7 is 3280. Moving on, a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So a_8 is 9841. Then a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then adding 1 gives 29524. So a_9 is 29524. Now, the original expression is 3 times a_9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...), and the innermost part was a_1, building up to a_9. So the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So the total value of the expression is 88572. Wait, let me verify that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me go through each step again quickly. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each step: 1+3*prev.\n\na1: 4\n\na2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think: The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it to check if my step-by-step approach was correct.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as I calculated step by step.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the original problem has 9 levels. The expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 levels, because each opening parenthesis is matched, so the number of 1+3 terms is 9. So the outermost is 3*(a_9), which is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) 9 times. So that's correct, a_9 is the innermost, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just confirm with another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or something similar, but given that the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation both give the same result, I'm pretty confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524*3.\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step and verifying with a recurrence relation and a direct multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Next Level Outward:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Next Level:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Continuing This Pattern:**\n   - Each level is calculated as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous result}\\).\n\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n5. **Final Step:**\n   - Multiply the outermost result by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the computed value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me count how many layers there are. Each time, there's a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s outside the parentheses. Starting from the left, I see 3(1 + 3(...)), then another 3 inside, so maybe each layer adds another 3. Let me count the number of 1 + 3 expressions. Hmm, each time after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so maybe there are 9 layers? Wait, let me check: starting from the innermost, each time there's a (1 + 3), and then each layer wraps around with another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each time followed by a 1 + 3(...). So, that suggests there are 9 layers, each time with a 3 multiplied by the next expression. So, to compute this, I should start from the innermost layer and work my way out. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)). But wait, the innermost part is (1 + 3) = 4, so the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost part)). So, let me substitute that in.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to label each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost. So, L1 is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, L2 is 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Then, L3 would be 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Hmm, that seems to be the pattern. Let me check:\n\n- L1: (1 + 3) = 4\n- L2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n- L3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n- L4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n- L5: 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n- L6: 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n- L7: 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n- L8: 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n- L9: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so if I have 9 layers, then L9 would be the outermost expression, right? So, the entire expression is L9, which is 36084. But let me make sure I'm counting correctly. Let me count the number of times I have to compute this from the inside out. Each time, I'm replacing the innermost (1 + 3) with 4, then moving out one layer each time, multiplying by 3 each step.\n\nWait, maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me think: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n where n is the number of layers from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on up to a_9. So, I need to compute a_9.\n\nWait, but let me check: in the original problem, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each time you move out, you have another 3*(1 + ...). So, if there are 9 layers, then a_9 would be the total expression. But let me make sure that I'm not off by one in my counting.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of times I see a ( after the first 3: 1. Then, 3(1+3(...)) again, so that's another layer. Let me count each time there's a ( after a 3. Let me try to parse this:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times I see \"3(\" after the initial 3. So, starting from the first 3, the next is 3(1 + 3(...), then another 3(1 + 3(...), and so on until the end. Let me count:\n\n1. After the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...\n2. Then another 3(1 + 3(...\n3. And so on, until the end.\n\nSo, let me count how many times \"3(\" appears after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of times \"3(\" occurs after the first 3 is 8 times. Wait, because each time I see a 3 followed by a (, except the first one, which is the initial 3. So, maybe there are 8 layers, not 9. Wait, perhaps I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each \"3(\" as a new layer. So, the initial 3 is outside, then each \"3(\" inside adds a new layer. So, let me count how many \"3(\" there are after the first 3. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the next is 3(1 + 3(...), so that's one \"3(\". Then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...), so that's another \"3(\", and so on until the end. So, how many times does \"3(\" appear? Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, let me try to count the number of \"3(\" in the entire expression.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of \"3(\" is as follows:\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...), so that's one \"3(\".\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...), so that's another \"3(\".\n3. This continues until the innermost part, which is (1 + 3).\n\nWait, how many times does \"3(\" occur? Let me count the number of \"3(\" in the string.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time after a \")\", there's a \"3(\", except for the very end. Let me count the number of \"3(\":\n\n1. After the first 3, we have (1+3(...), so that's one \"3(\".\n\n2. Then, inside that, another \"3(\", so that's two.\n\n3. Continuing, we have \"3(\", \"3(\", \"3(\", \"3(\", \"3(\", \"3(\", \"3(\", \"3(\", and then the innermost part is (1+3), which doesn't have a \"3(\" after it.\n\nWait, that seems like there are 8 \"3(\" after the initial 3. So, perhaps there are 8 layers. So, that would mean that I have to compute from a_1 to a_8.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted earlier when I thought there were 9 layers. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIf each \"3(\" adds a new layer, then the number of layers is equal to the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3. So, in the expression, starting after the first 3, I see \"3(\" eight times. So, that would mean 8 layers.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost layer, which is (1 + 3) = 4, that would be layer 1. Then, each time moving out, we add another layer.\n\nSo, let's redefine:\n\n- a_1 = (1 + 3) = 4\n- a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n- a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n- a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n- a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n- a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n- a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n- a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nSo, if there are 8 layers, then the total expression is a_8, which is 12027. But wait, let me check the original problem again to make sure.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3, I see:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have 3(1 + 3(...), so that's one \"3(\".\n\nThen, inside that, each time we have another \"3(\".\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 1\n2. Then inside that, 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 2\n3. Continue until the innermost part.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8 because each \"3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 8 \"3(\" after the initial 3. So, that would mean a_8 is the total expression, which is 12027.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought there were 9 layers, I got 36084, which seems too big. Let me see if I can confirm this by another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nWait, let's see: Each a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nFirst, let's write out the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, so depending on how many layers we have, the result can be either 36084 or 12027. So, this is where the confusion arises from whether there are 8 or 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each time we have a 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost (1 + 3). Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...), so that's one opening parenthesis.\n\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3(...), so that's two.\n\n3. Continuing, I can see that each \"3(\" adds another opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, actually, each time we have a \"3(\", that's a new layer, so let's count the number of \"3(\" in the entire expression.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the next is 3(, then another 3(, and so on until the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me count the number of \"3(\":\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...), so that's one \"3(\".\n\n2. Then inside that, another \"3(\", so that's two.\n\n3. Continuing, I can see that there are 8 \"3(\" after the initial 3. So, that would mean 8 layers, leading to a_8 = 12027.\n\nBut wait, when I count the number of opening parentheses, perhaps it's 9. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the expression, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 8, because each \"3(\" adds one. Wait, no, actually, each \"3(\" is a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3, which is 8. Therefore, the total expression would be a_8 = 12027.\n\nBut when I first thought, I considered 9 layers, which gave me 36084, but that might have been a miscount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each \"3(\" corresponds to a new layer, and the number of layers is equal to the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3. So, if there are 8 \"3(\", then we have 8 layers, so a_8 = 12027.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again. The problem is:\n\nCompute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, let me count the number of times \"3(\" occurs after the first 3.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each time I see \"3(\", that's a new layer.\n\nLet's count:\n\n1. After the first 3: 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 1\n2. Then inside that: 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 2\n3. Continue: 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 3\n4. Again: 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 4\n5. Again: 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 5\n6. Again: 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 6\n7. Again: 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 7\n8. Again: 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 8\n\nAfter that, the innermost part is (1 + 3), which doesn't have another \"3(\", so we stop at 8 layers.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is a_8 = 12027.\n\nWait, but when I first thought I had 9 layers, I got 36084, which seems too large. Let me check with n=8:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 12027.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute it step by step again, starting from the innermost layer.\n\nInnermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nSo, that's 8 layers, resulting in 12027.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers because the innermost part is (1+3), and each time we have a 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, with the innermost being layer 1.\n\nWait, let me try again. Let me count the number of times I have to compute 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, so if I count 9 layers, then the total expression is 36084.\n\nBut earlier, I thought there were 8 layers because of the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising from how I'm counting the layers. Let me try a different approach.\n\nEach time I have a 3*(1 + ...), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) as layer 1, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, if the expression has 9 layers, then the total would be a_9 = 36084.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, each \"3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\" after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 1\n\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 2\n\n3. Continue until the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). So, how many \"3(\" are there?\n\nLet me count each \"3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. After the first 3: 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 1\n\n2. Then, inside that: 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 2\n\n3. Then, 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 3\n\n4. Then, 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 4\n\n5. Then, 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 5\n\n6. Then, 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 6\n\n7. Then, 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 7\n\n8. Then, 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 8\n\n9. Then, the innermost part is (1 + 3), so there's no \"3(\" after that. So, actually, there are 8 \"3(\" after the initial 3, meaning 8 layers, leading to a_8 = 12027.\n\nWait, but when I thought of layers as starting from the innermost as layer 1, then each time moving out adds a layer, so if I have 9 layers, then the total would be a_9 = 36084.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the initial 3 is outside, and each \"3(\" inside adds a new layer. So, if there are 8 \"3(\" after the initial 3, then we have 8 layers inside, so the total expression would be a_8 = 12027.\n\nBut when I computed up to a_9, I got 36084, but that would require 9 layers, which would mean 9 \"3(\" after the initial 3, but in the problem, there are only 8 \"3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write out the expression with indices to see exactly how many layers there are.\n\nLet me write the expression with indices:\n\nLet\u2019s define E as the entire expression.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let me index each layer:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but in the expression E, how many layers do we have? Let me see:\n\nE = 3*(1 + Layer2)\n\nLayer2 = 3*(1 + Layer3)\n\nLayer3 = 3*(1 + Layer4)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the innermost layer is (1 + 3), which is Layer1, and then each Layer2 to Layer9 are built upon that.\n\nBut in the problem's expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when I wrote E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))), I added an extra layer, making it 9, but in reality, the problem has 8 layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to note that each time we have a \"3(\", that's a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3, which is 8, so the total expression is Layer9, which is 36084. Wait, no, because Layer1 is (1 + 3), then Layer2 is 3*(1 + Layer1), Layer3 is 3*(1 + Layer2), etc., up to Layer9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, how many times do we have a \"3(\" after the initial 3? Let me check again:\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of \"3(\" after that is 8, which would imply 8 layers, each time moving inward, so the total expression would be Layer9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer8, I got 12027, but that would correspond to 8 layers, starting from Layer1 as (1 + 3). So, perhaps the problem has 9 layers, with Layer9 being the outermost.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach: let me write the entire expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, so if I have to compute all the way up to the outermost layer, that's 9 layers, starting from (1 + 3) as layer1, then layer2 to layer9. So, the total expression would be layer9, which is 36084.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, how many times do we have \"3(\"?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) \u2192 1\n\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 2\n\n3. Continue until the innermost part, which is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does \"3(\" occur after the initial 3? Let me count each \"3(\":\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), that's one \"3(\".\n\n- Inside that, another \"3(\", that's two.\n\n- Then another \"3(\", three.\n\n- Then another, four.\n\n- Then another, five.\n\n- Then another, six.\n\n- Then another, seven.\n\n- Then another, eight.\n\nSo, there are 8 \"3(\" after the initial 3, meaning 8 layers inside, so the total expression would be layer9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I thought that with 8 layers, the result would be 12027, but that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the initial 3 is layer1, and each subsequent \"3(\" adds a new layer. So, if there are 8 \"3(\" after the initial 3, then the total expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) eight times, which would be layer9.\n\nWait, let me try to see: Each \"3(\" after the initial 3 adds a new layer, so 8 \"3(\" would mean 8 layers after the initial 3, making it 9 layers in total. So, the total expression would be layer9, which is 36084.\n\nBut when I computed up to 8 layers, I got 12027, but that would be if I had only 8 layers in total, starting from (1 + 3) as layer1.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to recognize that the number of layers is equal to the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3, which is 8, so the total expression is layer9, which is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this using the formula for a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me write it as:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 3 \u21d2 -2K = 3 \u21d2 K = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1.5 \u21d2 3C = 5.5 \u21d2 C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nNow, if we have n layers, the total expression is a_n.\n\nNow, in the problem, how many layers do we have? Let me see.\n\nAs earlier, the problem has 8 \"3(\" after the initial 3, which would correspond to n=8 layers. So, the total expression would be a_8.\n\nCompute a_8 using the formula:\n\na_8 = (11*3^8 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 3^8:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\nThus,\n\na_8 = (11*6561 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 11*6561:\n\n6561 * 10 = 65610\n\n6561 * 1 = 6561\n\nSo, 65610 + 6561 = 72171\n\nNow, subtract 9: 72171 - 9 = 72162\n\nDivide by 6: 72162 / 6 = 12027.\n\nSo, a_8 = 12027.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought there were 9 layers, I got 36084, which is a_9.\n\nCompute a_9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6.\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n11*19683 = let's compute:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19"

Starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), then each time we add another layer of 3(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, each 3 is followed by a (1 + 3(...)), so let me see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. Next, (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. And so on, until we have nine layers of nesting.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Each time we add a new layer, the number of nested 3s increases by one. Let me count the number of times I see a 3 followed by a (1 + ...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- The first innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another 3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because each time we have a new 3(1 + ...) until we reach the outermost 3(...).\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine sets of 3(...). Let me see: the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many times does 3(1 + ...) occur? Let's count the number of 3s after the first one. Each time, we have a 3 followed by a (1 + ...). Let me see:\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another 3 inside, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each time we have a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on, until we have 9 layers. Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside, it's 1 + 3(...). Each time, inside the parentheses, it's 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3s after the first one. Each 3 is part of a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as having 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me check:\n\n- The innermost layer is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Maybe I should approach it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. That way, I can compute each layer one by one without getting confused.\n\nSo, let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each time we add another 3*(1 + ...), so the number of layers is 9, right? Because each time we have a new 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I went up to Layer 9, which is 36084. But let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let's see: the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3), then each time we have another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3:\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3*(1 + ...)\n3. Continuing until we have nine layers.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's eight layers. Because starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's one layer, then each subsequent 3*(1 + ...) adds another layer. So, the total number of layers would be nine because each time we add a new layer. Let me see:\n\n- Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n- Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n- Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n- Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n- Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n- Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n- Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n- Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n- Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but when I look at the original expression, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine sets of 3(...). So, that would mean there are nine layers, each time adding another 3*(1 + ...). So, my calculation above is correct, ending at Layer 9 with 36084.\n\nBut wait, let me verify that again because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me parse the expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call this Layer 1.\n\n2. Moving out one layer, we have 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. That's Layer 2.\n\n3. Next layer out: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. Layer 3.\n\n4. Then, 3*(1 + 48) = 147. Layer 4.\n\n5. Next, 3*(1 + 147) = 444. Layer 5.\n\n6. Then, 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. Layer 6.\n\n7. Next, 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. Layer 7.\n\n8. Then, 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. Layer 8.\n\n9. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Layer 9.\n\nSo, yes, that's nine layers. Therefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when I'm doing arithmetic quickly, I might make a mistake. Let me go through each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Now, 1336*3: 1336*3. Let's compute that:\n\n1336 * 3:\n3*6=18, carryover 1\n3*3=9 +1=10, carryover 1\n3*3=9 +1=10, carryover 1\n3*1=3 +1=4\nSo, 4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let's compute 4009*3:\n\n4000*3=12000\n9*3=27\nSo, 12000 + 27 = 12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute that:\n\n12028*3:\n8*3=24, write down 4, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8\n0*3=0\n2*3=6\n1*3=3\nSo, 36084. Correct.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 36084.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually? Because computing nine layers manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Maybe there's a geometric series or some recursive formula that can be applied here.\n\nLet me analyze the structure. Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote the nth layer as L_n, then:\n\nL_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1})\n\nWith L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), with L_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to expand this:\n\nL_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nSimilarly, L_{n-1} = 3 + 3*L_{n-2}\n\nSubstituting back:\n\nL_n = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*L_{n-2}) = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*L_{n-2} = 3 + 9 + 9*L_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this way, I can see that each step adds another power of 3. Let me try to find a general formula.\n\nLet me compute the first few terms to see the pattern:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nL_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nWait, 444? Let me check that again. 1 + 147 = 148, 148*3 = 444. Correct.\n\nL_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nL_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nL_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nL_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, the numbers are growing exponentially. Let me see if I can express L_n in terms of a sum.\n\nFrom the recursive formula:\n\nL_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous part and the particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 3\n\nThe homogeneous solution satisfies L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 3 => -2A = 3 => A = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = C*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check: when n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3C => 11/2 = 3C => C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = 11*(3^n)/6\n\nBut let's see if this matches our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nL_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (33/6) - (9/6) = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nL_2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - (9/6) = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - (9/6) = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nL_4 = (11/6)*81 - 3/2 = (891/6) - (9/6) = 882/6 = 147. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nL_5 = (11/6)*243 - 3/2 = (2673/6) - (9/6) = 2664/6 = 444. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nL_6 = (11/6)*729 - 3/2 = (8019/6) - (9/6) = 8010/6 = 1335. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\nL_7 = (11/6)*2187 - 3/2 = (24057/6) - (9/6) = 24048/6 = 4008. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\nL_8 = (11/6)*6561 - 3/2 = (72171/6) - (9/6) = 72162/6 = 12027. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\nL_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2 = (216513/6) - (9/6) = 216504/6 = 36084. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the closed-form expression for L_n is (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nBut since we need L_9, we can compute it as:\n\nL_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo,\n\nL_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, compute 19683 \u00f7 6:\n\n19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, multiply by 11:\n\n3280.5 * 11 = ?\n\nCompute 3280 * 11 = 36080\n\n0.5 * 11 = 5.5\n\nSo, total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2 = 1.5:\n\n36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084\n\nWhich matches our earlier result. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the recursive formula to compute L_9, but since we've already done that, and the closed-form expression gives the same result, I'm confident that 36084 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing one more layer using the closed-form expression. Let's say n=5:\n\nL_5 = (11/6)*243 - 3/2\n\nCompute 243 \u00f7 6 = 40.5\n\n40.5 * 11 = 445.5\n\n445.5 - 1.5 = 444. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works perfectly.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form expression, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 3*(1 + previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer, we find the value of the expression.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 3*(1 + next term). The innermost term is (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - **Layer 1**: (1 + 3) = 4\n   - **Layer 2**: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n   - **Layer 3**: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n   - **Layer 4**: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n   - **Layer 5**: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n   - **Layer 6**: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n   - **Layer 7**: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n   - **Layer 8**: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n   - **Layer 9**: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n3. **Final Result**: After computing all layers, the outermost layer gives the result 36084.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{36084}$"

That's the simplest part. Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Then, moving one step out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4. Hmm, 3 times 4 is 12. Now, the next layer out is another (1 + 3(...)), where the ... is the 12 we just got. So, that would be 1 + 12. Let me compute that: 1 + 12 is 13. Then, moving out another layer, we have 3 times that 13. 3 * 13 is 39. Next layer is 1 + 39, which is 40. Then, 3 * 40 is 120. Next, 1 + 120 is 121. Then, 3 * 121 is 363. Moving out, 1 + 363 is 364. Next, 3 * 364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Next, 3 * 1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. After that, 3 * 3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer is 3 * 9841. Let me compute that: 3 * 9841. Hmm, 9841 times 3. Let me do that step by step. 9000 * 3 is 27,000. 800 * 3 is 2,400. 40 * 3 is 120. 1 * 3 is 3. Now, adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400. 29,400 + 120 is 29,520. 29,520 + 3 is 29,523. So, putting it all together, the final result is 29,523. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, 3 * 4 = 12. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13. 3 * 13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. 3 * 40 = 120. 1 + 120 = 121. 3 * 121 = 363. 1 + 363 = 364. 3 * 364 = 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. 3 * 1093 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. 3 * 3280 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. 3 * 9841 = 29,523. Yep, that seems consistent. Each step follows logically, and I don't see any errors in the multiplication or addition. So, I think that's the correct answer. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve this, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Multiply by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n\n3. Next layer:\n   - \\(1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times 13 = 39\\)\n\n4. Continue this process:\n   - \\(1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times 40 = 120\\)\n   - \\(1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times 121 = 363\\)\n   - \\(1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times 364 = 1092\\)\n   - \\(1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times 1093 = 3279\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times 3280 = 9840\\)\n   - \\(1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times 9841 = 29523\\)\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{29523}\n\\]"

Let me just do it step by step.\n\n29524\n\n*         3\n\n------------\n\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 *3 =12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miss any.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3=4 (Layer 1)\n2. 1+3*4=13 (Layer 2)\n3. 1+3*13=40 (Layer 3)\n4. 1+3*40=121 (Layer 4)\n5. 1+3*121=364 (Layer 5)\n6. 1+3*364=1093 (Layer 6)\n7. 1+3*1093=3280 (Layer 7)\n8. 1+3*3280=9841 (Layer 8)\n9. 1+3*9841=29524 (Layer 9)\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check: how many layers are there? The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions.\n\nEach time we have a 1+3, that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each time we go out, we add another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3 (1)\n- Then 1+3(1+3) (2)\n- Then 1+3(1+3(1+3)) (3)\n- Continuing until the outermost 1+3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is followed by a (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of times 3(1+3 appears.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3, each (1+3 is followed by another 3(1+3(...)). Let me see:\n\nThe first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), and so on, until the innermost 3.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3(1+3 appears, which I think is 9 times.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the number of layers is equal to the number of 1+3 terms. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3 (1), then each time we go out, we add another 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let's see:\n\nThe expression has 9 instances of 1+3, each nested within the previous one. So, 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I compute, I ended up with 9 layers, resulting in 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut let me check: perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me see the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3 (1)\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...).\n\nSo, how many 1+3 terms are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3 (1)\n2. 1+3(1+3) (2)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3)) (3)\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) (4)\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))) (5)\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) (6)\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) (7)\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) (8)\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) (9)\nThen, the outermost 3 is multiplied by this 9th layer.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I had 9 layers, resulting in 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try a different approach: let me write down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me confirm each step:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me check each computation again:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, I think I've computed it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here, each containing 1 plus 3 times the next set. So, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, then moving outward each time. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and working my way out. Let me try that approach. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Okay, so the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, so now we're at 40. Continuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Wow, that's getting bigger each time. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, moving on, the next expression is 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is... let me compute that: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. Wow, that's a big number. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. Well, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. Okay, so that's the next layer. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. Wow, that's huge. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that. 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. Hmm, that's getting really large. Wait, but how many layers are we supposed to compute? Let me check the original problem again. It starts with 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) and it seems like there are nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, we've done the first one, then each step adds another layer. So, let me count how many times I've computed so far. Starting from the innermost: 1. 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Wait, so that's nine layers? Let me count the steps: 1. 1+3=4 (step 1) 2. 1+3*4=13 (step 2) 3. 1+3*13=40 (step 3) 4. 1+3*40=121 (step 4) 5. 1+3*121=364 (step 5) 6. 1+3*364=1093 (step 6) 7. 1+3*1093=3280 (step 7) 8. 1+3*3280=9841 (step 8) 9. 1+3*9841=29524 (step 9) So, yes, that's nine layers, each time computing the next outer layer. So, after nine layers, we get 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, the outermost operation is 3*(29524). Let me compute that. 3*29524: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, actually, let's do it properly. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in my calculations somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers. Let me go through each step again quickly: 1. 1 + 3 = 4. 2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. 3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. 4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. 5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. 6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. 7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. 8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. 9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, all the intermediate steps seem correct. Each time, I multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, unless I messed up the multiplication at some point, this should be correct. Let me check one of the larger multiplications again. For example, step 9: 3*9841. Let me compute that again. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. Yep, that's correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute it another way. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my answer is right. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3 multiplied by the previous result. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps that in another 1 + 3(...). Let's see: 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on. How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the left, the first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost part. Let me count the number of opening parentheses.

Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(something), and that something is another 1 + 3*(another something), etc. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3.

Each time we go one layer out, we add another 1 + 3. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer.

Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time we have a new (1 + 3(...)).

Another \u21928\n9. Another \u21929\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). That means the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, I need to compute starting from layer 1 and work my way out to layer 9. So, let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, no.

Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen the final result is 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers increases. Maybe there's a geometric series or something similar here.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (3^{11} -3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\n3^{11}=3*59049=177147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). Applying this formula up to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see: starting from the left, the first term is 3 times (1 + 3 times something). Then inside that, there's another 1 + 3 times something, and this repeats. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the first 3, each subsequent term adds another layer until the last one is 1+3, which doesn't have another parenthesis after it. So, let's see: starting from the innermost part, which is 1+3. Then each step out adds another 1+3*(previous result). So perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that.\n\nOkay, so the innermost expression is 1+3. Let me compute that first. 1+3 is 4. So, the next layer out would be 1+3*(4). Let's compute that: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. So, that's the next step. Then, the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that gives me the next layer up. Let me keep track of each step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again because I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount how many times I had to compute each step. Starting from the innermost 1+3, which is step 1, and each subsequent step adds a layer. Let's see how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, each subsequent 3 is multiplied by another (1 + 3*(...)), and this repeats. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one. Wait, perhaps another approach: each time I go a layer out, I'm adding another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, starting from the first 3, each time we have a 3 inside a parenthesis. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, we have 9 opening parentheses. Wait, no, let me count the number of 3s inside:\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times we have 1+3(...). Let me see: starting from the innermost, each step is 1+3*(previous). So, the innermost is 1+3, then next is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as the number of 3s inside each parenthesis. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3. Then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the first step is 1+3=4. Then the next is 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, then 1+3*40=121, then 1+3*121=364, then 1+3*364=1093, then 1+3*1093=3280, then 1+3*3280=9841, then 1+3*9841=29524, and then the outermost layer is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me count the number of steps:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Then, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 9 steps after the innermost 1+3, but the initial expression has 9 layers after the first 3. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the initial expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ... ))). So, perhaps there are 9 layers inside. Let me see: each time you have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so starting from the innermost, each step adds a layer. So, the innermost is 1+3=4, then each next step adds another 3*(previous result) + 1.\n\nSo, if I have 9 layers inside the first 3*(...), then I would compute 9 steps starting from 1+3. Let me confirm:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (step 1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (step 2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (step 3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (step 4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (step 5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (step 6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (step 7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (step 8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (step 9)\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then inside that, another 3, and so on, until the innermost 3. So, how many 3s are there? Let me see: starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside a parenthesis. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 9 more 3s, each inside a parenthesis. So, that would mean that there are 9 layers inside. So, I would need to compute 9 steps, each time calculating 1 + 3*(previous result). So, as I did before, that gives me 29524 at the ninth step, and then the outermost 3 times that is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation in my steps. Let me go through each step again:\n\n1. Step 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Step 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Step 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Step 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Step 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Step 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Step 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, that looks correct. Now, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by this result, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check if I did that multiplication correctly. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n= (30,000 - 476) * 3\n= 30,000 * 3 - 476 * 3\n= 90,000 - 1,428\n= 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n(4\u00d73)=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n(2\u00d73)=6 +1=7 \u21927\n(5\u00d73)=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n(9\u00d73)=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n(2\u00d73)=6 +2=8 \u21928\nSo, 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the computation is as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. Because sometimes when you have nested parentheses, it's easy to miscount how many times you need to apply the operation. Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses. Starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. So, in the original expression, how many 3s are there after the first one?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each inner 3 is part of the next layer. Let me count the number of 3s inside each parenthesis:\n\n- The first 3 is outside.\n- Inside that, there's another 3: that's the second 3.\n- Inside that, another 3: third.\n- Continuing this way, each layer adds another 3 until the innermost, which is the ninth 3.\n\nWait, so that would mean there are 9 layers inside the first 3, which would require 9 steps of computation. So, that's why I computed up to 29524, which is the ninth step, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nWait, each step is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula, but since it's only 9 terms, maybe computing each step is easier. However, just for fun, let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the first few terms:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I started by computing each layer step by step, then verified using a recurrence relation and a closed-form formula to ensure that the result is correct. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Let me write the expression again to visualize it better: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))). So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), right? Let me check: starting from the inside, the first set is (1 + 3), then that result is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and so on. So, perhaps I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. So, that's the first step. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from above)). So, substituting 4 in, it becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13.\n\n2. Moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(13)). Let me compute 3*13: that's 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, now we're at 40.\n\n3. Next layer out: (1 + 3*40). Compute 3*40: that's 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, now it's 121.\n\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*121). Compute 3*121: 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, moving up to 364.\n\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*364). Compute 3*364: let's see, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093). Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280). Compute 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841). Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n9. Finally, the outermost layer: (1 + 3*29524). Let's compute 3*29524. Hmm, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, so each time I compute a layer, I substitute the result back into the next outer layer. So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, then moving outward, each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me list these steps with their results:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Layer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me check the original expression again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, there are nine opening parentheses after that, meaning there are nine layers inside. So, perhaps I went one layer too far. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me write the expression as a tree:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3\" is the innermost, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: each time we have a 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost, we have:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n10. Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*29524 = 88573 (Layer 10)\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" expressions. Starting from the innermost, each time we have \"1 + 3(...)\", so let's see:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n1. (1 + 3( ... )) => Layer 1\n2. Then, inside that, another (1 + 3( ... )) => Layer 2\n3. And so on, until we reach the innermost (1 + 3)\n\nHow many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" expressions. Each time, it's one more layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: the original expression ends with ))))))))), which is nine closing parentheses. That suggests that there are nine layers inside the first 3. So, perhaps I went one layer too far in my previous calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Let me consider that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with n layers. The problem is to compute this for n=9 layers inside the first 3. So, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which itself has 9 layers. So, perhaps I need to compute 9 layers inside the first 3, which would make the outermost layer the 10th layer. But perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider that each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, perhaps I need to compute up to Layer 9 and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n2. Then, moving out, the next is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)), which is Layer 2.\n3. Then, (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) is Layer 3.\n4. Continuing this way, up to Layer 9.\n\nSo, in total, there are 9 layers inside the first 3. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, perhaps I should compute up to Layer 9, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I went up to Layer 10, which was 88573, but that was including the outermost 3*(Layer 9). So, perhaps I need to adjust that.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is (1 + 3*(Layer 8)), and so on. So, perhaps I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, let me list the layers again, making sure I only go up to Layer 9:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went up to Layer 10 as 88573, which included the multiplication by 3. But perhaps that was incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers inside the first 3, so the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that was the value of (1 + 3*(Layer 8)), which is the innermost part of the expression. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had Layer 10 as 88573, which was 1 + 3*29524. But that would be incorrect because the expression is 3*(Layer 9), not 1 + 3*(Layer 9). So, I think I made a mistake in my initial approach by including an extra layer. Therefore, the correct approach is to compute up to Layer 9, which is 29524, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nLet me confirm this by recalculating:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth layer.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, for the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. So, the 9th layer is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that confirms the result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation to find a general formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Hmm, so each time, there's another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of times 3(1+3(...)) occurs.

So, does that mean there are 9 layers? Wait, but the expression is 3(1+3(...)), so each layer adds a set of parentheses. So, if there are 9 closing parentheses, that suggests 9 layers. Let me check that.\n\nWait, no, because each layer adds one pair of parentheses, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3(1+3(...) is nested. So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is the first layer. Then each time, wrapping another layer around it.\n\nSo, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial one. Let's see:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each time, there's another 3 inside. Let me count the number of 3s: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3. Wait, that's 9 threes, but the first one is the outermost, so the number of layers is 9? Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps it's 8 layers because the first 3 is outside. Wait, maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each time we have 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1+3). Then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3)), and so on, until we have 9 layers. Wait, but how many times does this happen? Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count how many \"1+3(\" there are:\n\n1. The first one is 3(1+3(...))\n2.

(1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer 1) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer 2) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. 1 + 3*(Layer 3) \u2192 Layer 4\n5. 1 + 3*(Layer 4) \u2192 Layer 5\n6. 1 + 3*(Layer 5) \u2192 Layer 6\n7. 1 + 3*(Layer 6) \u2192 Layer 7\n8. 1 + 3*(Layer 7) \u2192 Layer 8\n9. 1 + 3*(Layer 8) \u2192 Layer 9\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers in total. So, the outermost is Layer 9, and the innermost is Layer 1. So, starting from Layer 1, which is (1+3), and then each subsequent layer wraps around the previous one.\n\nSo, maybe the approach is to compute each layer starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, then compute Layer 2 using Layer 1's result, and so on until Layer 9, and then multiply by the outermost 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(Layer 9). So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute Layer 9, then multiply by 3, that should give me the final result.\n\nSo, let's start computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n5*3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3 = 27 +1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3 = 6 +1=7 \u21927\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I computed each layer correctly. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: (1+3) = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 +3*121=1 +363=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(29524)=88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here? Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nWait, the general form seems to be a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, a_1=4\n\na_2=1+3*4=13\n\na_3=1+3*13=40\n\na_4=1+3*40=121\n\na_5=1+3*121=364\n\na_6=1+3*364=1093\n\na_7=1+3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1+3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nSo, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th layer. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the initial step-by-step computation of each layer. It's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic when dealing with large numbers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes, everything checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer starting from the innermost, we find that the 9th layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better. So, starting from the innermost part: $1 + 3$ is the innermost expression. Then, moving outward, each subsequent expression is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me try to parse this step by step. Let's number the expressions from the inside out. Let's say the innermost expression is level 1, then each layer outwards is the next level. So:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, counting the parentheses, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a level. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time I see a \"(\", that's a new level. Let me count them: 1. 3(1+3(1+3(... So that's one. Then another \"(\", making it two, and so on until the innermost part. Let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the outermost, how many levels are there? Let's see: The first \"3(\" starts level 1, then the next \"(\" is level 2, and so on until the innermost. Wait, actually, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me look: Starting from the left, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times...). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of \"3(\" expressions. The outermost is 3(, then inside that is another 3(, and so on. Let me count them: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"(\" after the first corresponds to a new level. Let's count the number of \"3(\" expressions. The first is 3(, then inside that is another 3(, and so on. Let me count: 1. 3(1+3(... 2. 3(1+3(... 3. 3(1+3(... 4. 3(1+3(... 5. 3(1+3(... 6. 3(1+3(... 7. 3(1+3(... 8. 3(1+3(... 9. 3(1+3(... Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, actually, each time I see a \"3(\" it's a new level, but I think there are 9 levels here because each time you go in, it's another 3(1+3(...). Let me check: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the outermost, the first 3( is level 1. Then inside that is another 3(, level 2, and so on until the innermost, which is level 9. So, there are 9 levels. Therefore, I can compute each level starting from level 9 and moving outward to level 1, then finally multiplying by 3 at the end. Let me write down each level and compute it step by step.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 9)\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 8)\n...\nAnd so on, until Level 1, then the final result is 3*(Level 1).\n\nOkay, let's start computing from Level 9.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*(Level 1) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. Because the outermost expression is 3*(Level 1), so once I compute Level 1 as 29524, then I multiply by 3. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 3*(29524) = 3*(30000 - 476) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me compute it directly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each level. Let me go through each level again step by step to verify.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Because each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level), which is similar to a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. But in this case, since it's nested, it's more like a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a formula for it.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value at level n, where n=9 is the innermost. So, L_9 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n+1} for n from 8 down to 1.\n\nSo, starting from L_9, we can compute L_8, L_7, etc., up to L_1, then multiply by 3.\n\nThis is exactly what I did earlier. So, my step-by-step computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ... )), it's a geometric series. But in this case, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). So, it's similar to x = 1 + 3x, but in this case, it's finite, so it's not an infinite series but a finite nested expression.\n\nIf it were infinite, the solution would be x = 1 + 3x => x = -0.5, but that's not applicable here since it's finite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the value at level n, with L_9 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n+1} for n=8 down to 1.\n\nSo, solving this recurrence, we can write L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it by expanding it.\n\nLet me try to write out the terms:\n\nL_9 = 4\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*L_9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L_1 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}, with L_9 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n+1}^{(h)}.\n\nThe characteristic equation would be r = 3r, which implies r=0, but that seems trivial. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}, which is a bit unusual because it relates L_n to L_{n+1}. Normally, we have L_{n+1} in terms of L_n, but here it's the other way around. So, perhaps it's easier to reverse the indices.\n\nLet me define m = 9 - n, so that when n=9, m=0, and n=1, m=8.\n\nThen, L_n = L_{9 - m}.\n\nThe recurrence becomes L_{9 - m} = 1 + 3*L_{9 - (m-1)} => L_{m} = 1 + 3*L_{m+1}.\n\nWait, that might not help much. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the recurrence in terms of L_{n+1} = (L_n - 1)/3.\n\nWait, that might be helpful. Let me try that.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}, we can rearrange to get L_{n+1} = (L_n - 1)/3.\n\nSo, starting from L_9 = 4, we can compute L_8 = (L_9 - 1)/3 = (4 -1)/3 = 1, but wait, that contradicts my earlier computation where L_8 was 13. So, perhaps I made a mistake in rearranging.\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nFrom L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}, solving for L_{n+1} gives L_{n+1} = (L_n - 1)/3.\n\nBut in my earlier computation, L_9 = 4, then L_8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is correct.\n\nBut using the rearranged formula, L_8 = (L_9 -1)/3 = (4 -1)/3 = 1, which is not correct. So, I must have made a mistake in rearranging.\n\nWait, no, the correct rearrangement is:\n\nFrom L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}, subtract 1: L_n -1 = 3*L_{n+1}, then divide by 3: L_{n+1} = (L_n -1)/3.\n\nBut in that case, L_{n+1} = (L_n -1)/3.\n\nBut in our case, L_9 = 4, then L_8 = (L_9 -1)/3 = (4 -1)/3 = 1, which contradicts our earlier correct value of L_8 =13.\n\nSo, clearly, I must have made a mistake in rearranging. Let me check again.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}.\n\nLet me solve for L_{n+1}:\n\nL_{n+1} = (L_n - 1)/3.\n\nBut if L_9 =4, then L_8 = (4 -1)/3=1, but earlier I computed L_8 as13, which is correct because L_8=1+3*4=13.\n\nSo, there's a contradiction here, which means I must have made a mistake in the rearrangement.\n\nWait, no, actually, the correct rearrangement is:\n\nFrom L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}, solving for L_{n+1} gives L_{n+1} = (L_n -1)/3.\n\nBut in our case, n=8, so L_8 =1 +3*L_9=1+12=13.\n\nBut according to the rearranged formula, L_9 = (L_8 -1)/3.\n\nSo, if L_8=13, then L_9=(13-1)/3=12/3=4, which matches.\n\nSo, the correct way is that L_{n} =1 +3*L_{n+1}, and L_{n+1}=(L_n -1)/3.\n\nSo, starting from L_9=4, we can compute L_8=1 +3*4=13, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, starting from L_8, L_9=(13 -1)/3=4.\n\nSo, the formula works correctly.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence is correct, and my earlier computations are correct.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*(Level 1)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using a different approach, such as expanding the entire expression.\n\nLet me try to write the entire expression step by step, expanding each parenthesis.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 9) =1 +3*4=13\n\nLevel 7:1 +3*(Level8)=1 +3*13=40\n\nLevel6:1 +3*(Level7)=1 +3*40=121\n\nLevel5:1 +3*(Level6)=1 +3*121=364\n\nLevel4:1 +3*(Level5)=1 +3*364=1093\n\nLevel3:1 +3*(Level4)=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLevel2:1 +3*(Level3)=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLevel1:1 +3*(Level2)=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level1)=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's not exactly a geometric series, but a linear recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern in the numbers I computed.\n\nLooking at the levels:\n\nLevel9:4\n\nLevel8:13\n\nLevel7:40\n\nLevel6:121\n\nLevel5:364\n\nLevel4:1093\n\nLevel3:3280\n\nLevel2:9841\n\nLevel1:29524\n\nI notice that each level is roughly 3 times the previous level plus 1. So, each level is 3*previous +1.\n\nWait, no, actually, each level is 1 +3*next level. So, it's a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express each level in terms of powers of 3.\n\nLet me see:\n\nLevel9=4=3^1 +1\n\nLevel8=13=3^2 +3^1 +1\n\nLevel7=40=3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nLevel9=4=3^1 +1=3+1=4. Correct.\n\nLevel8=13=3^2 +3^1 +1=9+3+1=13. Correct.\n\nLevel7=40=3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1=27+9+3+1=40. Correct.\n\nLevel6=121=3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1=81+27+9+3+1=121. Correct.\n\nLevel5=364=3^5 +3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1=243+81+27+9+3+1=364. Correct.\n\nLevel4=1093=3^6 +3^5 +3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1=729+243+81+27+9+3+1=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel3=3280=3^7 +3^6 +3^5 +3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1=2187+729+243+81+27+9+3+1=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel2=9841=3^8 +3^7 +3^6 +3^5 +3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1=6561+2187+729+243+81+27+9+3+1=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel1=29524=3^9 +3^8 +3^7 +3^6 +3^5 +3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1=19683+6561+2187+729+243+81+27+9+3+1=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each level n (starting from n=9) is equal to the sum from k=0 to k=9-n of 3^k. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, for Level9, n=9, sum from k=0 to k=0 of 3^k=1. But Level9=4=3+1=4. So, that's 3^1 +1=4. So, perhaps it's the sum from k=0 to k=1 of 3^k, but that equals 1+3=4.\n\nSimilarly, Level8=13=1+3+9=13, which is the sum from k=0 to k=2 of 3^k=1+3+9=13.\n\nLevel7=40=1+3+9+27=40, which is the sum from k=0 to k=3 of 3^k=40.\n\nWait, but 1+3+9+27=40? Let me check: 1+3=4, +9=13, +27=40. Yes.\n\nSimilarly, Level6=121=1+3+9+27+81=121. Correct.\n\nSo, in general, Level m (where m is the level number starting from 9) is equal to the sum from k=0 to k= m-9 of 3^k.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly, but the pattern is that each level corresponds to the sum of a geometric series up to a certain power of 3.\n\nSpecifically, Level9 corresponds to sum from k=0 to k=1 of 3^k=4.\n\nLevel8 corresponds to sum from k=0 to k=2 of 3^k=13.\n\nLevel7: sum from k=0 to k=3 of 3^k=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to Level1, which is the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k=29524.\n\nWait, let me check: The sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nYes, because the sum of a geometric series is (r^{n+1} -1)/(r-1). Here, r=3, so sum= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Level9, which is sum from k=0 to k=1 of 3^k, n=1, so sum=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nLevel8: sum from k=0 to k=2 of 3^k=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nLevel7: sum from k=0 to k=3 of 3^k=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nLevel6: sum from k=0 to k=4 of 3^k=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nLevel5: sum from k=0 to k=5 of 3^k=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nLevel4: sum from k=0 to k=6 of 3^k=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel3: sum from k=0 to k=7 of 3^k=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel2: sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel1: sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each level m corresponds to the sum from k=0 to k= (10 - m) of 3^k.\n\nWait, for Level9, m=9, sum from k=0 to k=1=10-9=1.\n\nSimilarly, Level8: sum from k=0 to k=2=10-8=2.\n\nYes, so Level m corresponds to sum from k=0 to k=10 - m of 3^k.\n\nTherefore, Level1 corresponds to sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level1)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step-by-step computation, recognizing the pattern as a sum of geometric series, and verifying each level's computation. All methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the nested expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Expression (Level 9):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Level 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Level 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Level 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Level 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Level 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Level 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Level 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Level 1:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Result:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me compute that first. \n\nFirst layer (innermost):\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3 times that result.

Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7.

Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on, let me count the layers again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, and working outwards to the first layer, which is multiplied by 3 at the end. So, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have nine layers in total. Hmm, so maybe I went too far before.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so the innermost is Layer 9, and the outermost before the final multiplication is Layer 1, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1), so 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nCompute from right to left:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers, so the final step is multiplying by 3, giving 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3, which is 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches the step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and each time, the multiplier is increasing by a factor of 3. So, maybe there's a pattern where each layer is (3^{n} - 1)/2, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward.\n\nWait, let me check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches. So, yes, that formula works.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then multiply by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as \\(\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, no, actually, the outermost expression is 3 times (1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the next inner expression. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" appears. Starting from the innermost part, which is just 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the opening parentheses: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, there are nine layers of nesting. That means I need to compute the innermost part first and then work my way outwards, each time substituting the result back into the next layer. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression step by step. The innermost part is 1 + 3, right? So, let's compute that first. Then, moving outwards, each layer is 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer. Then, the entire expression is 3 times the result of the outermost layer. So, perhaps I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the center.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost part is the last \"1 + 3\", so let me write it down as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nWait, maybe that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I can start from the innermost and work my way out, computing each step.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost expression:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(Layer1).

Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer9, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial approach. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe it's a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but that seems similar to a geometric progression. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. So, according to the recurrence, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=1, a_1 should be 4. Let's check: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 should be 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3, a_3 should be 40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 is indeed 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recursive approach or recognizing it as a geometric series, we find the total value is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to write this down step by step. So, the innermost part is 1+3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, each expression is 1 + 3 times the next one. So, starting from the innermost, each step involves taking 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner expression. So, let me write this down as a series of steps.\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the inside out. So, the innermost is step 1: 1 + 3. Then step 2 is 1 + 3*(step 1 result). Step 3 is 1 + 3*(step 2 result), and so on until step 9, which is the outermost one. Wait, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new level. So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count them:\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI see that after the first 3, there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, each opening parenthesis is a new level. So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each step one by one.\n\nLet me denote each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n...\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, I need to compute each Level from 1 to 9, starting with Level 1.\n\nLet me compute each level step by step.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check it another way.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but that doesn't match the previous method. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke it down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, and multiplied each by 3, I got 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 88572. So that matches.\n\nSo, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the computations for each Level to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check Level 8 again: 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then +1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 3*9841. Let me compute that:\n\n9841*3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is 9000 + 800 + 40 + 1.\n\nWait, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then +1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the number of levels. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach time, it's 1+3(...), so each time we have a new level. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1+3\n\nThen, each next level adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another 1+3*(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's level 1.\n\nThen, the next one is 1+3*(level1), that's level2.\n\nThen, 1+3*(level2)=level3.\n\nContinuing until the outermost, which is level9.\n\nSo, yes, 9 levels in total, from level1 to level9.\n\nSo, my earlier computation was correct, leading to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each time we have another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, yes, 9 levels. So, my computation from level1 to level9 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a smarter way to compute this without having to compute each level manually? Maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking at the structure, each level is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for each level n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Level 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nThis confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each level step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each level is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous level. By computing each level step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value at each level follows a pattern that can be expressed using a formula involving powers of 3. The final result is computed as 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series of terms of the form 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute Each Level:**\n   - Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Final Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the result of Level 9 by 3:\n   3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, starting from L1 = 1 + 3, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on until L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3: let's compute step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8\n\nSo, reading from the top, it's 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe breaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each L1 to L9.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, L9 is 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can try computing it in another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nWait, the expression is a geometric series? Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for L9, which is the 9th term, n=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I applied the formula correctly. The general solution is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm that L9 is indeed 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

And so on, until I work my way out to the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, let me check: the entire expression is 3 times (something). That something is 1 + 3 times another similar expression. So, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, there are multiple layers here. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 1 + 3*(...), that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then each time we go out, we add another 1 + 3*(...). Let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3*(...):\n\n1.

So, yes, there are 9 layers inside, each building on the previous one, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, to compute this, I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, starting from Layer 1 and working my way up to Layer 9, then multiply by 3.\n\nLet me start computing each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524. So, 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n24*3 = 72\n\nNow, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me define a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of Layer n.\n\nGiven that:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nFor n > 1,\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nSo, we can write:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, which is exactly what I did earlier. Now, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n instead of computing each term step by step.\n\nThis recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by:\n\nL_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a)\n\nWait, let me recall the formula. For a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is:\n\nL_n = a^{n} * (L_0 - (b)/(1 - a)) + (b)/(1 - a)\n\nBut wait, in our case, the recurrence starts at n=1 with L_1 = 4.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution and particular solution approach.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^{(h)} = C * a^{n} = C * 3^{n}\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (b=1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nL_p = a*L_p + b\n\nSo, L_p = 3*L_p + 1\n\nSolving for L_p:\n\nL_p - 3*L_p = 1\n\n-2*L_p = 1\n\nL_p = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4:\n\nL_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, now, instead of computing each layer step by step, I can use this formula to find Layer 9 directly.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's the result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then:\n\nTotal expression = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^{10} = 59049, so 3^{11} = 3*59049 = 177147\n\nThus, Total expression = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or find a closed-form expression, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or computations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down into layers, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, looking back, the structure is 3(1 + 3(...)), so each step involves multiplying by 3 after adding 1. Let me try to map this out. Let me number each level from the inside out. Let's say the innermost is level 1: Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, level 2 would be 1 + 3*(level 1). So, level 2: 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, level 2 is 13. Now, level 3 would be 1 + 3*(level 2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, level 3 is 40. Hmm, this seems to be increasing quite a bit. Let me keep going.

Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Level 6 is 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Level 7 is 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Level 8 is 9841. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Level 9 is 29524. Finally, the outermost level is 3*(level 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost part: Level 1: 1+3=4. Level 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Level 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Level 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Level 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Level 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Level 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Level 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Level 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. I think I did it correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each level step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of the function f(x) = 3*(1 + x). So, each time, we're plugging the result back into the same function. Let me see how many times this function is applied. Looking at the original expression, it's 3(1 + 3(...)), and there are nine sets of parentheses, so I think it's applied eight times? Wait, no, let me count. The innermost is (1+3), then each time we have another 3*(1 + ...), so starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. So, the innermost is level 1: (1+3). Then each subsequent level adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the outermost is level 9, since we have nine sets of parentheses. Wait, no, actually, in the original expression, the number of opening parentheses is nine. Let me check: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each time we have another 3(1+3(...)), so how many times is this repeated? Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) sections. The first is 3(1+3(...)), then inside that, another 3(1+3(...)), and so on, until the innermost is (1+3). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(1+3(...)), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(1+3(...)). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see: The first layer is 3(1+3(...)), then each time we have another 3(1+3(...)). So, the innermost is (1+3), which is one layer. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the number of layers is 9, because the innermost is 1, and then each step out adds another, so 9 layers in total. Therefore, we applied the function f(x) = 3*(1 + x) eight times, because starting from x0 = 3, then x1 = 3*(1 + x0), and so on until x8. Wait, no, maybe it's nine times. Let me think. If the innermost is x0 = 1 + 3 = 4, then x1 = 1 + 3*x0, and so on until x8, which would be the outermost. So, in total, we have nine layers, but eight applications of the function f(x) = 1 + 3x. Hmm, perhaps I should model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8, and so on recursively. So, perhaps I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so rearranged, a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Good. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144 divided by 2 is 88572. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each level step by step. So, that's a good consistency check. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any calculation errors, and the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation. So, yeah, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Start with the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Work Outwards:**\n   - Each subsequent layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous layer)}\\).\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Computation:**\n   - **Level 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Level 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - **Level 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - **Level 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - **Level 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - **Level 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - **Level 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - **Level 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - **Level 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Final Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the result by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nThus, the computed value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost parentheses simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So the next layer would be:\n\n1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*4 = 12\n\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so the next layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So:\n\n1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3*13 = 39\n\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so that layer simplifies to 40. Let's keep going. Next layer is:\n\n1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nAlright, moving on. Next layer is 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 = 363\n\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nSo, that's 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let's compute that. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092.\n\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nOkay, next layer: 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279.\n\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nMoving on. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840.\n\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nHmm, let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again because 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 is indeed 29524. Okay, moving outward.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*29524.\n\nLet's compute 3*29524. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. So adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nThen, 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*88573.\n\nCalculating 3*88573. Let's break it down: 3*80000=240000, 3*8000=24000, 3*500=1500, 3*70=210, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, +1500 = 265500, +210 = 265710, +9 = 265719.\n\nSo, 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nWait a second, let me confirm that. 3*88573: 88573 * 3. 3*3=9, 3*7=21, 3*5=15, 3*8=24, 3*8=24. So writing it out:\n\n88573\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n265719\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nNow, moving to the next layer: 1 + 3*265720.\n\nCalculating 3*265720: 265720 * 3. Let me compute this step by step.\n\n200000 * 3 = 600000\n\n60000 * 3 = 180000\n\n5000 * 3 = 15000\n\n700 * 3 = 2100\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\nAdding all together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000; 780000 + 15000 = 795000; 795000 + 2100 = 797100; 797100 + 60 = 797160.\n\nSo, 3*265720 = 797160.\n\nThen, 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*797161.\n\nLet's compute 3*797161. Hmm, this is getting a bit big, but let's break it down.\n\n700000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n\n90,000 * 3 = 270,000\n\n7,000 * 3 = 21,000\n\n100 * 3 = 300\n\n60 * 3 = 180\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding all together: 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000; 2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000; 2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300; 2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480; 2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483.\n\nSo, 3*797161 = 2,391,483.\n\nThen, 1 + 2,391,483 = 2,391,484.\n\nNow, moving to the outermost layer: 3*(previous result). Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire inner expression. So, after computing the innermost parentheses all the way up, the final step is to multiply by 3.\n\nBut wait, in my previous steps, I went all the way up, and the last result I got was 2,391,484. Is that the value inside the outermost parentheses? Let me check.\n\nWait, the structure is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, starting from the innermost, each time we compute 1 + 3*(next innermost). So, when I computed up to 2,391,484, that was the result of the innermost expression, and then the outermost operation is 3*(that number). So, the final computation is 3*2,391,484.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the structure. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1+3(\".\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, the first (1+3) is the innermost, then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, each time we have a 1+3*(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me count:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is one layer. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), that's the first layer.\n- Then, moving out, each time we have another 1+3(...). Let's count:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Wait, but when I started computing earlier, I think I went through 9 layers, ending up with 2,391,484, and then the outermost operation is 3*(that number). So, the total computation would be 3*2,391,484.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of \"1+3(\" is 9, meaning that there are 9 layers. Each layer is computed starting from the innermost. So, starting with layer 1: (1+3)=4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nWait, hold on, earlier I went beyond 9 layers, but maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen, each layer is built upon the previous. So, let me list them:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps by going beyond 9 layers. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is layer1: 4\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, layer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, so earlier when I went up to 2,391,484, I was actually going beyond 9 layers, which isn't correct. So, I think I made a mistake in my initial approach by not correctly identifying the number of layers.\n\nSo, to correct that, I should only compute up to layer9, which is 29524, and then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that with another method to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just go through the layers again to ensure I didn't miscount.\n\nLayer1: (1+3)=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this could be a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about that. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, which might be easier for computation, especially for larger n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, no, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, which is our case, since we have 9 layers:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution confirms that the result is indeed 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous result). By methodically computing each layer, we find the innermost value and work our way out, ultimately multiplying the final inner result by 3. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a closed-form solution confirming the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 + 3 times the next inner term. There are 9 layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Final Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me count how many times this nesting happens. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). Let me see: starting from the first 3, then each time it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me count: the first one is 3(1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me see: the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, after the initial 3, there's a 1 plus 3 times another expression. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then that's inside another 1 + 3*(...)\n3. So, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count how many times the 1 + 3(...) occurs. Let me try to parse the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, perhaps I can compute this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as E_n, where n is the number of layers. Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let's try that.\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. So, each time, I take the result from the innermost layer and plug it into the next outer layer. So, let me list each step:\n\n1. Innermost: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost expression: 3*E9 = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, but let me check: the original expression is 3*(E9). So, if I compute E9 as above, then the total would be 3*E9.\n\nWait, but let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. Then, the outermost is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had E1 through E9, each being the result of each layer, and then the final result is 3*E9. So, let me compute 3*29524.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check the multiplication again.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this step-by-step because if each E_n is correct, then the final result should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that each E_n is correct.\n\nStarting with E1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total 3000+279=3279. Then 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression has how many 1+3(...) terms? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1+3(...) is another layer. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, from the first 3, the next is 1+3(...), and that continues until the innermost 1+3.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time there's a \"(\", which corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" parts. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the first inner expression is 1+3(...), then inside that another 1+3(...), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach time, adding another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" in the expression. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first inner expression is 1+3(1+3(...)), and each time, another 1+3(...) is added.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of closing parentheses at the end. The expression ends with nine closing parentheses after the initial 3, so maybe there are nine layers. Let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the closing parentheses at the end: there are nine of them, so that would mean nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3*(...).\n\nSo, in my earlier step-by-step, I had E1 to E9, which would correspond to nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*previous result.\n\nThus, the final result after nine layers is E9 = 29524, and then the outermost 3*E9 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. If the expression ends with nine closing parentheses, that suggests that there are nine layers of nesting. So, starting from the innermost 1+3, which is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, layer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I can compute this using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula for a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from 1, each time it's 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, where E_n is the nth layer.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric progression, but perhaps it's a linear recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, E_1 is 1 + 3 = 4. Then E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution E_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, E_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that the earlier step-by-step computation was correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). By evaluating each layer starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, we compute each step as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Each one is of the form 3*(1 + something). Maybe I can compute each innermost part first and then move outward. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each next layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let's see, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step. Let me define each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, starting from the innermost. So, L1 is the innermost part: (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, L2 is 3*(L1) + something? Wait, no, looking again, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps it's better to compute from the inside out, each time substituting the innermost expression with its value. So, let me try that. Let's start with the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). So, that's 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next part is (1 + 3*(innermost)). Wait, but actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try to outline this. Let me number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9. So, layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then layer 2: (1 + 3*layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: (1 + 3*layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: (1 + 3*layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: (1 + 3*layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Layer 9: (1 + 3*layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but the original expression is 3*(layer9). So, after computing layer9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 3*3=9. So, 29524*3=88572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total value is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check. Layer1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from layer1 as 4, layer2 as 13, layer3 as 40, layer4 as 121, layer5 as 364, layer6 as 1093, layer7 as 3280, layer8 as 9841, layer9 as 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Let's see, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me represent this recursively. Let me define L_n as the nth layer, starting from the innermost as L1. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, I can see a pattern here. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{homog} = C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{part} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, layer9 corresponds to n=9. So, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form expression for the entire expression. Let me think. The entire expression is 3*(L9), where L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it. So, the expression simplifies to (3^{11} -3)/2, which equals 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes. Let me verify 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. Then, 3^11 is 3*59049=177147. Correct. So, (177147 -3)=177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. Correct. So, yes, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1 (Innermost):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me write it out step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me define a1, a2, a3, ..., a9, where each a_n is the nth layer from the inside.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\na1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3\n\nAnd so on, up to a9, which would be the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(a9), where a9 is 1 + 3*a8, and a8 is 1 + 3*a7, etc., down to a1 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, perhaps I can compute each a_i step by step, starting from a1 and moving up to a9, then multiply the result by 3.\n\nThat sounds manageable. Let me try that.\n\nSo, let's compute each a_i step by step.\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, compute 3*29000 = 87000\n\nThen, 3*524 = 1572\n\nAdd them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nSo, the total value is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from a1:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*a9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, that seems correct.

Let me recount how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's a1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*a_i), so a2, a3, up to a9.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*a9, which we computed as 88572.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each a_i seems to follow the recurrence relation a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_i.\n\nLet me see: The recurrence is a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^i.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_i = C*3^i - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor i=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\ni=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\ni=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\ni=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\ni=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\ni=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\ni=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\ni=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\ni=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_i = (3^{i+1} -1)/2, then 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without having to calculate each a_i step by step.\n\nBut regardless, both methods lead to the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me write this out step by step. Let me denote the innermost part first. The innermost expression is (1+3). Let me compute that: 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that simplifies to 40. Hmm, okay, so each time I'm taking the result from the inner expression, multiplying it by 3, adding 1, and that becomes the new value for the next outer level. Let me try to tabulate this to keep track. Let me list each level from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8.

The original expression is 3 times a big expression, and inside that, each time it's 1 + 3 times another similar expression. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds another level. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. The first ( is after the first 3, so that's one level.\n2. Then each subsequent ( adds another level. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Wait, no, actually, let me recount. Each time I see a ( after a 3, that's a new level. Let me parse it:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1+3(...))\n2. Then another ( after the next 3: (1+3(...))\n3. Continuing this way, each time I see a 3 followed by (, that's a new level.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see that each time I have 1+3(...), which is a new level. So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's level 1. Then each time moving out, we have another 1+3*(level n). So, perhaps the total number of levels is 9, because I can see that the innermost is (1+3), and then each time we add another layer. Let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of 3s followed by (:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(... \n\nWait, so that's 9 instances of 3(, meaning there are 9 levels. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's level 1, and then each outer level adds another 3(...). So, I think I have 9 levels to compute. Wait, but when I did the earlier steps, I had 10 levels. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to list each level again, more carefully.\n\nLet me index the levels from the innermost as level 1, moving outward.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after Level 9, we have the outermost 3 multiplied by this result. So, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me confirm that:\n\n29,524\n*        3\n----------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the levels. Let me recount:\n\nLevel 1: (1+3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the original expression has 9 levels, right? Let me count the number of times 3( occurs after the initial 3.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, the initial 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), and each time inside, another 3( occurs. Let me count the number of 3( instances:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each 3( is a new level.\n\nSo, 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nCounting the number of 3( after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(... \n\nSo, 9 levels. So, the innermost is level 9, which is (1+3) = 4, then level 8 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, up to level 1, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, no, actually, the outermost is 3*(...). So, the innermost is level 1, and the outermost is level 9, and then multiplied by 3. Wait, no, perhaps I have it reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index the levels starting from the innermost as level 1, then each outer level as level 2, up to level 9, which is the expression inside the first 3(...). Then, after that, we have the final 3 multiplied by level 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in numbering the levels. Let me try again.\n\nLet me parse the expression from the inside out.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one level out, we have (1 + 3*(previous result)).\n\nSo, (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\nThen, moving out another level: (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\nContinuing this way, each time moving out one level, I have:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 levels, we reach the expression inside the first 3(...). So, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check the calculation again step by step to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nStarting with level 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093:\n\n1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280:\n\n3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841:\n\n9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 levels correctly. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses. Each time, it's 3 times another (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each 3(...) adds another level. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each time inside, another 3(...). Let me see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the first 3, each time we have 3(...), so how many 3s are there after the first one? Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so that's one level.\n\n- Then inside that, another 3(...), so that's two levels.\n\n- Continuing this, each time we enter another 3(...), so let's count how many times we have 3( after the first one.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of 3( is 9. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(... \n\nYes, that's 9 times. So, that means there are 9 levels inside the first 3(...). Therefore, the calculation I did earlier with 9 levels is correct, leading to the final result of 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing it in another way. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula here. Each level is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me write out the terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works.\n\nSo, for a_9, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nThis confirms that the result is correct.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's another way to see it. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think I've checked it enough ways, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by simplifying the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each level step by step:\n\n1. Innermost level: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing all levels, the outermost expression is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me compute that first. That should be straightforward.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So, the next level is:\n1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\n3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so that level gives me 13. Now, moving out another level, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, next is:\n1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that.\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger. So, now we have 40. Moving out another level, the expression is:\n1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, that's 121. Interesting. Let me keep going.\n\nNext level out: 1 + 3*(121). Compute that.\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWow, that's a jump. So now we're at 364. Next level out is:\n1 + 3*(364). Let me compute that.\n\n3*364: Hmm, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nOkay, so now we have 1093. Moving out another level, we have:\n1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute that.\n\n3*1093: Let me break it down. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nHmm, that's a big number. So, we're at 3280 now. Next level out is:\n1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute that.\n\n3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nAlright, so now we have 9841. Moving out another level, the expression is:\n1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute that.\n\n3*9841: Hmm, let's see. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nOkay, so now we're at 29524. Next level out is:\n1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Wait, no, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. So adding all these: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWow, that's a huge number. Now, moving out another level, the expression is:\n1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute that.\n\n3*88573: Let me break it down. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nAlright, so now we have 265720. The next level out is:\n1 + 3*(265720). Let's compute that.\n\n3*265720: 3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*700 is 2100, 3*20 is 60. So, adding those: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nSo, now we're at 797161. The next level out is:\n1 + 3*(797161). Let's compute that.\n\n3*797161: Hmm, 3*700000 is 2100000, 3*90000 is 270000, 3*7000 is 21000, 3*100 is 300, 3*60 is 180, 3*1 is 3. Adding them up: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. Then, 1 + 2391483 = 2391484.\n\nOkay, so now we have 2391484. Moving out another level, the expression is:\n1 + 3*(2391484). Let me compute that.\n\n3*2391484: Let's break it down. 3*2000000 is 6000000, 3*300000 is 900000, 3*90000 is 270000, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*400 is 1200, 3*80 is 240, 3*4 is 12. Adding them up: 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000, plus 270000 is 7170000, plus 3000 is 7173000, plus 1200 is 7174200, plus 240 is 7174440, plus 12 is 7174452. Then, 1 + 7174452 = 7174453.\n\nSo, now we're at 7174453. The next level out is:\n1 + 3*(7174453). Let me compute that.\n\n3*7174453: Let's see. 3*7000000 is 21000000, 3*100000 is 300000, 3*70000 is 210000, 3*4000 is 12000, 3*400 is 1200, 3*50 is 150, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 21000000 + 300000 = 21300000, plus 210000 is 21510000, plus 12000 is 21522000, plus 1200 is 21523200, plus 150 is 21523350, plus 9 is 21523359. Then, 1 + 21523359 = 21523360.\n\nAlright, so now we have 21523360. The next level out is:\n1 + 3*(21523360). Let me compute that.\n\n3*21523360: Let's break it down. 3*20000000 is 60000000, 3*1000000 is 3000000, 3*500000 is 1500000, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*3000 is 9000, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*0 is 0. Adding them up: 60000000 + 3000000 = 63000000, plus 1500000 is 64500000, plus 60000 is 64560000, plus 9000 is 64569000, plus 900 is 64569900, plus 180 is 64570080, plus 0 is still 64570080.

    "text": " Let me try to parse the expression properly. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by a big parenthesis. Inside that parenthesis, it's 1 plus 3 multiplied by another parenthesis, which in turn has 1 plus 3 times another parenthesis, and so on. So, it's a chain of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the outside, the first set is 3*(1+3*(...)). Then inside that, another 1+3*(...), and this continues. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, let's see: the first one is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, each time, the pattern repeats. Let me count the number of times the 1+3*(...) occurs. Starting from the innermost part, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me try to count them: 1. The innermost is 1+3. 2. Then moving out, the next one is 1+3*(1+3). 3. Next, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)). 4. Then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))). Hmm, wait, that might not be the right way. Alternatively, perhaps each layer adds another 1+3*(...), so the number of layers is the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me try to write down each step as I go inward. Let me denote the innermost expression as A1, then the next one as A2, and so on, until the outermost one, which would be A9, since I see nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3. Wait, let me check again. The expression is: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first innermost. Then each step adds another 1+3*(previous). Let me count the number of innermost expressions. The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers do we have? Let's see: 1. Innermost: 1+3 = 4. 2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. 3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. 4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. 5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. 6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. 7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. 8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. 9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. 10. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572. Wait, but let me check that again because I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me write it down step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer starting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s denote A1 as the innermost expression: A1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, A2 = 1 + 3*A1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, A3 = 1 + 3*A2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nA4 = 1 + 3*A3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nA5 = 1 + 3*A4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nA6 = 1 + 3*A5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nA7 = 1 + 3*A6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nA8 = 1 + 3*A7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nA9 = 1 + 3*A8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*A9 = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let me compute 3*29524. Let's do this step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. I think I might have miscounted how many times I had to compute A1 through A9. Let me recount the number of nested parentheses.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each layer adds another (1+3*(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time I have a new (1 + 3*(...)), so how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3*(, the first inner parenthesis is (1 + 3*(...)), then each time another (1 + 3*(...)). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3*(, there are 9 opening parentheses: 1 + 3*(..., and each time, a new (1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is the 9th one, which is (1+3), and then each layer adds another.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to A9, which would correspond to 9 layers, but when I counted, I thought it was 8 or 9. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the number of times 1 + 3*(...) occurs, which is 9 times, starting from the innermost. So, each time, we have a new A1, A2, up to A9.\n\nWait, but when I computed A1 through A9, I ended up with A9 = 29524, and then 3*A9 = 88,572.\n\nBut perhaps I made a miscalculation in one of the steps. Let me recompute each A step to make sure.\n\nStarting again:\n\nA1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nA2 = 1 + 3*A1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nA3 = 1 + 3*A2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nA4 = 1 + 3*A3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nA5 = 1 + 3*A4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nA6 = 1 + 3*A5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nA7 = 1 + 3*A6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nA8 = 1 + 3*A7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nA9 = 1 + 3*A8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*A9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. But let me check one of the intermediate steps to make sure.\n\nFor example, A3: 1 + 3*A2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. That's correct.\n\nA4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nA5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nA6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nA7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nA8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nA9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27,000, 841*3=2,523, so total is 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524: Let me compute 29,524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20,000 *3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000*3=27,000.\n\n500*3=1,500.\n\n20*3=60.\n\n4*3=12.\n\nAdding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check again the number of layers because sometimes it's easy to miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, the pattern is 1+3(1+3(...)), and each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3 (A1)\n2. 1+3*(A1) = A2\n3. 1+3*(A2) = A3\n4. 1+3*(A3) = A4\n5. 1+3*(A4) = A5\n6. 1+3*(A5) = A6\n7. 1+3*(A6) = A7\n8. 1+3*(A7) = A8\n9. 1+3*(A8) = A9\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, which matches my earlier calculation. So, I think the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about whether there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here. The expression is of the form:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...)))\n\nThis is similar to a geometric series but nested. Let me see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLet me denote S as the entire expression:\n\nS = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...)))\n\nBut in our case, it's a finite nesting, not infinite. So, perhaps the formula is different.\n\nAlternatively, for each layer, we can write it as S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, starting from S_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, S_1 = 4.\n\nS_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nS_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nS_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nAnd so on, which is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nSo, for n layers, S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = 4.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*S_n.\n\nIn our case, n=9, so S_9 = 29,524, and 3*S_9 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, and the calculations seem correct. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer's value and substitute it into the next until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (A\u2081):**\n   \\[\n   A\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Layer (A\u2082):**\n   \\[\n   A\u2082 = 1 + 3 \\times A\u2081 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Layer (A\u2083):**\n   \\[\n   A\u2083 = 1 + 3 \\times A\u2082 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourth Layer (A\u2084):**\n   \\[\n   A\u2084 = 1 + 3 \\times A\u2083 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Fifth Layer (A\u2085):**\n   \\[\n   A\u2085 = 1 + 3 \\times A\u2084 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Sixth Layer (A\u2086):**\n   \\[\n   A\u2086 = 1 + 3 \\times A\u2085 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Seventh Layer (A\u2087):**\n   \\[\n   A\u2087 = 1 + 3 \\times A\u2086 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Eighth Layer (A\u2088):**\n   \\[\n   A\u2088 = 1 + 3 \\times A\u2087 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Ninth Layer (A\u2089):**\n   \\[\n   A\u2089 = 1 + 3 \\times A\u2088 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Outermost Layer:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times A\u2089 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, so it's a series of 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and this repeats multiple times. Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost part, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So that means we have 9 layers of nesting. So perhaps I can compute each layer starting from the innermost one and work my way out. That seems manageable. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote each layer as Layer 1 to Layer 9, where Layer 1 is the innermost one, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. So Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 4.\n\nThen Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So let's compute that:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Because in the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So if Layer 1 is 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13, as I had.\n\nThen Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute that: 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nHmm, 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524 step by step. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Wait, but that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, 29524*3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo writing it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nSo the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me list them again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify each step again because it's easy to make a multiplication error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again.\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait a second, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 multiplied by (Layer 9), which is 29524, so 3*29524=88572. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me think again: each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost, each step is correct, and the multiplication by 3 at the end is also correct. So I think my approach is right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward way, especially since each step depends on the previous one. So, I think the method I used is correct, and the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check one more time the multiplication of 29524 by 3 to be absolutely sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo 3*(20000) = 60000\n\n3*(9000) = 27000\n\n3*(500) = 1500\n\n3*(20) = 60\n\n3*(4) = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is calculated as 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner layer.

Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let's see: starting from the innermost, there's 1+3, then each layer adds another. Wait, actually, each time I have a 3 followed by (1+3(...)), so maybe each layer is a multiplication by 3 after adding 1. So, perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to write this out step by step, starting from the innermost part. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9 or something like that. Wait, actually, let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: the innermost is 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3*(innermost), then the next layer is 1+3*(previous), and so on until the outermost layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, each time, the number of layers increases by one. Let me count the number of times I see a \"1+3(\" before the first closing parenthesis. Let me see: Starting from the first 3, then inside it, another 3, and so on. Wait, maybe it's better to count the number of layers by looking at the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), and inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me see: the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is the innermost one: 1+3. Then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, let's see: after the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), so the number of layers is 9, because starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another, so from innermost to outermost, it's 9 layers. Wait, actually, let me count the number of 3s outside the parentheses. The expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, each layer has a 3 multiplied by a (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3*(1+3), then the next is 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on until the outermost layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time we have a new opening parenthesis, that's a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is the innermost. Then each subsequent layer adds another parenthesis. Let me count them: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the number of opening parentheses is 9, right? Because after the first 3, we have 9 opening parentheses before we reach the innermost 1+3. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me try to parse this correctly. The expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) Let me see: starting from the outermost 3, then inside it, there's a 1+3*(...), and inside that, another 1+3*(...), and so on until the innermost 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. So, the first 3 is followed by \"(\", then inside that, another \"(\", and so on. Let me count them: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9. Therefore, there are 9 layers. Wait, but each layer is a 1+3*(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3. Then layer 2: 1+3*(layer1). Layer3:1+3*(layer2), and so on up to layer9:1+3*(layer8). Then the outermost expression is 3*(layer9). So, perhaps I can compute this by starting from layer1 and moving outward, computing each layer step by step. That sounds manageable. So, let me start by computing layer1: L1 = 1 + 3. That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4. Then layer2: L2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then layer3: L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer4: L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer5: L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer6: L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer7: L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer8: L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer9: L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's see: 29524 * 3. Let me compute step by step: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Next digit: 9*3=27, write 27. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, 29524 *3: starting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 *3: Let me compute it another way. 29524 *3 = (30000 - 476) *3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which might not be a straightforward geometric series. But perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nAlternatively, I could model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, L(1)=1+3=4. Then, L(n)=1 +3*L(n-1). So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found as a constant. Let me assume the particular solution is a constant, say L_p(n)=A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 +3*A => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n)= C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, L(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, L(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L(1)= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, layer9=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*L(9)=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation.\n\nBut since I already computed it step by step and verified with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward, computing each layer step by step. \n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, perhaps I can start by evaluating the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me count the number of innermost parentheses. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by the previous result. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me assign variables to each layer to make it clearer. Let me say:\n\nLet\u2019s define a_1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, since there are nine layers.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the original problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen the next layer out is 1 + 3*a_1, which is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call that a_2 = 13.\n\nThen the next layer is 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. That's a_3 = 40.\n\nContinuing this way, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, maybe I can compute each a_n step by step up to a_9, and then the entire expression would be 3*a_9.\n\nWait, let me check that. The entire expression is 3*(a_9), right? Because each layer is multiplied by 3 except the innermost one, which is just 1 + 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the innermost expression. Wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(next inner layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so if I have nine layers, the innermost is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nSo, let me compute each a_n step by step.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9, which would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20*3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because 29524*3 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, carryover 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my a_n computations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the sequence.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). So, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are nine sets of (1+3(...)), each time adding another layer. So, the innermost is the ninth layer, which is (1+3). Then each step out adds another layer. So, the number of layers is nine, so a_9 is correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed a_9, I started from a_1 as (1+3) and went up to a_9, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if the expression is correctly represented. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is the innermost.\n\nThen each layer is 1 + 3*(next inner layer). So, for example, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), etc., up to nine layers.\n\nWait, so actually, the innermost is (1+3) which is layer 1, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), layer3 is 1 + 3*(layer2), etc., up to layer9.\n\nTherefore, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing a_9. Let me recompute each step:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this with another approach to ensure that I didn't make a mistake. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved using the formula for a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a geometric series.\n\nIn this case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nWait, no, actually, in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative step-by-step approach and the formula approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
