    "text": " So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of opening parentheses: Starting from the innermost, each 1+3(...) is a layer. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside, I think. Wait, let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is layer 1, then each wrapping is a new layer. Let's count the number of layers. Each time we have a 1+3(...), so how many times does 1+3 appear? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3 terms. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let me count: Starting from the innermost, the first 1+3 is layer 1. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nBecause each time, we add another 1 + 3*(...). So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). Therefore, n=9 layers. So, using the closed-form expression, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miscount. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears, which is 9 times. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is the start of Layer1: 1+3(...)\n- Then each subsequent ( starts a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 9 layers. Therefore, n=9, and the value is 3*a_9=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I had miscounted the layers, I might have gotten a different answer, but I think 9 layers is accurate here. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step. Using the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, we find the value of the innermost expression and then multiply by 3 for the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

So, each layer corresponds to n=1,2,...,9. So, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*(a_9). So, let's compute that. First, compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, if I use the closed-form formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the computed value is correct. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'll conclude that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Wait, but in our earlier computation, layer 1 was 4, layer 2 was 13, etc., up to layer 9 being 29524. Let's check using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier calculation. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then we multiply by 3, giving 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if we wanted to compute it using the closed-form expression, we could note that the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.
