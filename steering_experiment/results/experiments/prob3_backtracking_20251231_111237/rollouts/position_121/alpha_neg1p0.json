So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our previous calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could also compute each layer using the closed-form formula. For example, layer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which is correct. Layer 2: n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, using the formula, layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.

    "text": ". So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, which matches (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Good. Then, layer 2 is a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches our earlier calculation. Similarly, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Yep, that's correct. So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which is exactly what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer, but recognizing the recurrence relation made it quicker, especially since n=9 is manageable. But since I already computed each layer step by step and got the same result using the closed-form, I think it's solid.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

Okay, so I think I've covered all the steps, both by computing each layer step by step and by finding a closed-form solution using the recurrence relation.

The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses: starting from the innermost 1+3, up to the 9th layer, which is multiplied by the outermost 3. Wait, actually, in the initial problem, it's 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...).

For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3)...))). Each layer adds another factor of 3. So, if I expand it, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). If I consider that, each time I'm adding 3 times a term, which itself is 1 plus 3 times another term, and so on. So, expanding all the way, the entire expression would be a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see that. Let's denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3)...))) Let me expand it step by step. Starting from the innermost: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's see if we can express this as a sum. Each time we have 1 + 3*something, which is similar to 1 + 3x, where x is the next layer. So, if we expand E, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Expanding the innermost: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 =13, then 1 +3*13=40, and so on, as before. So, the expansion is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, the general form is E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 12))) Hmm, but maybe it's easier to recognize that the entire expression is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^1 up to 3^9, multiplied by something. Wait, let me think. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer, and we have 9 layers, the expansion would result in a sum of 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... +3^9, but perhaps with some coefficients. Wait, maybe not exactly, because each 1 is being multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me try to see. Let's denote each layer as a_i, where a_1=4, a_2=13, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then E=3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula we derived earlier, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then E=3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.

If I expand all the layers, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me try to compute this expansion step by step. Let me see, starting from the innermost term: Let me denote E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 E_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 E_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 E_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 E_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 E_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, same as before. Alternatively, thinking of it as a geometric series, each E_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then 3*E_9 = 88572. So, either way, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let's count the number of layers: Starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds one more layer. Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then each time we go out, we add a layer. Let's see how many layers there are in the original expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of \"1+3(...)\" parts. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(1+3)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then moving out, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3: The first \"(\" after 3 is for Layer 1. Then each subsequent \"(\" adds a new layer.

Wait, let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 9. So, that would mean 9 layers. So, n=9. Therefore, using the closed-form formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be thought of as 3 * a_n, where a_n is the nth term in the sequence defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which we found to be (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that's 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result.

Solving this recurrence gives \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For nine layers, this results in \\( a_9 = 29524 \\).

Alternatively, maybe I can compute this more efficiently by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so expanding this, we can write a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is the same as the expression we're dealing with.

So, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k - 1? Wait, no, because sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly what we had earlier. Wait, but when n=1, sum_{k=0}^1 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1. Similarly, sum_{k=0}^2 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is a_2. So, indeed, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.
