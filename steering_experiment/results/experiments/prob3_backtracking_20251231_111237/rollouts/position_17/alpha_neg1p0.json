    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1). We just found Layer 1 is 4, so 3 times 4 is 12. Then, 1 + 12 equals 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3 times 13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 equals 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3 times 40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 equals 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3 times 121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 equals 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3 times 364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 equals 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3 times 1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 equals 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3 times 3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 equals 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3 times 9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 equals 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3 times 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 multiplied by 3. Let me do the multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst, 20000 times 3 is 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 times 3 is 27000.\n\nNext, 500 times 3 is 1500.\n\nThen, 20 times 3 is 60.\n\nFinally, 4 times 3 is 12.\n\nNow, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because 29524 times 3 shouldn't be 88572. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in breaking it down.\n\nAlternatively, I can do it digit by digit:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. But let me verify with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 2 = 59048, then add 29524 to get 59048 + 29524. Let's add them:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nAdding units place: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, we get 88572. Hmm, so that seems correct. But wait, 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572. So, that's the final result.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because 29524 \u00d7 3 seems a bit high. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 directly:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the expression was 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524, giving 88572. But let me double-check the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524, so 3\u00d729524=88572. That seems correct. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly because sometimes it's easy to miscount when dealing with multiple nested parentheses.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, I think. Because each time you go out a layer, you add another 3(...). So, starting from 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), and so on until the ninth layer. So, Layer 9 is indeed the outermost one. So, I think my counting is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, for n=2, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nWhich is exactly what I computed earlier. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nI can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for any layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, the expression becomes (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step-by-step computation, recursive formula, and a closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Each Layer n is equal to 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That was easy. Now Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Next, Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's see, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 841*3 is 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), since the outermost part is 3 times the innermost layer. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) We already know Layer 1 is 4, so plug that in: 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that. 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) Layer 2 is 13, so plug that in: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121 first. 121*3: 120*3 is 360, plus 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let's compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the entire expression equals 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step seems correct. Each time, I multiplied the previous layer's result by 3 and added 1. So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, 3 times 29524 is 88,572. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any arithmetic errors, but let me verify a couple of the layers just to be sure. Let's check Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Wait, no, Layer 7 was 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841, which is Layer 8. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841, which is 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 is 88,572. Yep, that looks good. So, I think I've computed the value correctly by working from the innermost parentheses outward, layer by layer.

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, my approach will be to compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward to Layer 9, then multiplying the final result by 3. Let me write each layer as a separate equation to keep track of things. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Alright, moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, that's a bit larger. Let's do Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, this is growing quickly. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Therefore, Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Thus, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Therefore, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, and 41*3 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total expression evaluates to 88572.

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Wait, no, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times something). So, maybe I should think of each layer as being 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let's do that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4.

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me write that down. Let's define Layer 1 as the innermost expression: Layer 1 = 1 + 3(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, Layer 1 is just 1 + 3, right? Because it's the innermost part. So, Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me try to see if there's a pattern here. Let me compute a few more layers to see if I can find a pattern or a formula that can help me compute it without having to go through each layer one by one. Let's compute Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the entire expression equals 88,572. Wait, that seems a bit large, but let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go back and verify each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3=88572. Correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a more efficient way to compute this without having to calculate each layer? Maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me see. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Let me write that down: Layer 1 = 4, as before. Then, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait, this looks similar to a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this. The recurrence relation is Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1) => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B). Let's compute the right-hand side: 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, let's use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, Layer 1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: Layer 1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: Layer 2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, is (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^(n+1) -1)/2, where n=9. Wait, let me see. Wait, no, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is (3^(10)-1)/2. So, the entire expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2=3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, I think I've got it right. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572.

    "text": " So, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, that might help. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here, but let me continue to see if it becomes clearer. Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) = 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) = 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so I need to compute 3 multiplied by 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me compute that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a miscalculation. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's correct. I can cross-verify by computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is right. Let's say, for example, if the expression was only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute that. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, computing directly: 3(1 + 3(4)) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. So, my approach works for a smaller case. Therefore, confident that my step-by-step computation is correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The given expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break it down layer by layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Wait, no, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3 times (Layer 1), but that can't be right because each Layer is inside another. Maybe I should think of it as each Layer being 1 + 3*(next Layer). Let me clarify. The innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer 9. So, perhaps I can compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2 using Layer 1, and so on until I reach Layer 9, and then multiply by 3. Let me try that approach. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That was simple enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. I can break this down: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524=88572 (correct). So, I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each Layer n is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1) => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, let's equate the terms: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition Layer 1 = 4: Layer 1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I calculated earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have Layer 9, let's compute Layer 9 using the formula: Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6. So, 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279.

Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.

Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. 1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. 60000+27000=87000+1500=88500+60=88560+12=88572. Yep, that all checks out.\n\nI think I've got it right. Each layer builds on the previous one, and by computing from the inside out, I can avoid getting lost in the nested structure. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time makes it manageable. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3 times Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3. Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives us 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4. Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5. Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1,092. Adding 1 gives 1,093. Layer 6 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6. Layer 6 is 1,093, so 3*1,093 is 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 is 3,280. Layer 7 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*Layer 7. Layer 7 is 3,280, so 3*3,280 is 9,840. Adding 1 gives 9,841. Layer 8 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*Layer 8. Layer 8 is 9,841, so 3*9,841 is 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 is 29,524. Layer 9 = 29,524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3 * 29,524. Let me compute that. 3 * 29,524: I can break this down as 3 * 29,000 = 87,000 and 3 * 524 = 1,572. Adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29,524 equals 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 is 12, carry over 1. 2 * 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5 * 3 is 15, carry over 1. 9 * 3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, carry over 2. 2 * 3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. So, putting it together: 88,572. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers, let me go through a few of them again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nAnd finally, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. All the steps seem correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations. So, I think the final answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to explore another way, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this forms a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nLet's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. It seems that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2,187 - 1)/2 = 2,186/2 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6,561 - 1)/2 = 6,560/2 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19,683 - 1)/2 = 19,682/2 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works for all layers up to n=9. So, using this formula, I can compute L_9 directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's much more efficient, especially if the expression were longer.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, which matches my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. Since the original expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^{11} is 177,147. So, 177,147 - 3 is 177,144. Divided by 2 is 88,572. Yep, same answer.\n\nThis method is even faster because it directly uses the formula without computing each layer. It's good to know both methods: step-by-step computation for verification and the formula for efficiency, especially when dealing with more layers.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^{10}=59,049, and 3^{11}=177,147. Correct.\n\nSo, 3^{11} - 3 is 177,147 - 3 = 177,144. Divided by 2 is 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this problem. Both methods lead me to the same answer, and I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern allowed me to derive a formula, which makes solving such problems much easier in the future.\n\nAnother thing I could consider is whether this expression relates to a geometric series or some other known series. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like each term is a multiple of the previous term plus a constant. That's exactly the kind of recurrence relation I dealt with earlier. It's a linear recurrence, and in this case, it's first-order because each term depends only on the immediately preceding term.\n\nI remember that for such recurrences, the solution can often be expressed in closed form using the method I applied: finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. It's a powerful technique, and I'm glad I remembered how to apply it here.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n2. Solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which gives the solution C*3^n.\n3. Find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, I assumed a constant particular solution and solved for it, getting L_p = -1/2.\n4. Combine the homogeneous and particular solutions: L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n5. Use the initial condition to solve for C: L_1 = 4 gave C = 3/2.\n6. Substitute C back into the general solution to get L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nThis formula allowed me to compute L_9 directly, which simplified the problem significantly. It's a good reminder of how useful recurrence relations can be in solving nested or repeated structures in mathematics.\n\nI also think about how this problem is similar to computing the value of a geometric series, but it's not exactly the same because each term isn't just a multiple of the previous term; it's a multiple plus a constant. So, it's more like an arithmetic-geometric series or something similar. But in this case, the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to expand the expression step by step, but that's essentially what I did initially, computing each layer one by one. The formula is just a shortcut that encapsulates all those steps into a single equation.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to visualize this problem. Maybe if I drew a tree where each node branches into another node three times, but I'm not sure if that would help. Alternatively, I could think of it as a sequence where each term depends on the previous one, which is exactly what the recurrence relation is.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, the answer remains the same. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure the result is correct.\n\nJust to make absolutely sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, but this time, I'll compute each layer and then multiply by 3 at the end. Sometimes, breaking things down differently can catch errors.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute the innermost 1 + 3: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(29,524). As before, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Yep, same result.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. It's always a bit nerve-wracking when dealing with multiple layers of nested expressions, but taking it step by step and verifying each computation helps mitigate errors.\n\nIn summary, the problem required computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the inside out. Recognizing the pattern allowed me to derive a formula, which provided an efficient way to compute the result without manually calculating each layer. Both methods led to the same answer, reinforcing the correctness of the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step or using a derived formula, we find the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Computation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1,093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1,093 = 3,280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3,280 = 9,841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9,841 = 29,524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, actually, looking again, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait a minute, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is Layer 9. So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's do this step by step: 29524 * 3. \n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500.\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60.\n\nAnd finally, 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check that again because 29524 * 3 should be:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 is 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because each layer depends on the previous one, and if I made a mistake in one layer, it would propagate through all the subsequent layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering the number of layers, it might be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined recursively as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, where a and b are constants. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L(n) = (L(1) - b/(a-1)) * a^(n-1) + b/(a-1).\n\nWait, let me recall the formula. For a linear recurrence of the form L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, the solution is L(n) = a^(n) * L(0) + b*(a^(n) - 1)/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1.\n\nBut in our case, L(1) = 4, so maybe we can adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nFor n=1, L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3, L(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L(9), and L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2, then 3*L(9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nTherefore, 3*L(9) = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By calculating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next, Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572.

Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer built upon the previous one, and by carefully computing each step, I arrived at the final result. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me try a different approach. Maybe instead of computing each layer step by step, I can recognize a pattern or use a formula. Wait, this seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula. Maybe I can solve this recursion. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n + c1*a_{n-1} + ... = f(n). In this case, it's a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the general formula for the recursion, I arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer. I think I'm done here. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a formula helped solidify the solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing that the expression is a nested set of terms where each term is \\(1 + 3\\) times another similar expression.

That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13. Therefore, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13 gives 39, and adding 1 gives 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nProceeding to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841 first. 9841 times 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Therefore, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we compute 3*29524. Let's do that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. It's easy to get lost with so many layers. Let me recap each layer's computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and each step seems correct. So, I think the final answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the final value is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result for the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4. Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wow, these numbers are increasing quickly. Let's keep going. Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364. That's a big number. Layer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5 = 1 + 3*364.

Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Wow, that's massive. Layer 8: 1 + 3*Layer 7 = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer 8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I should compute each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the number is 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did this correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo compute the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but actually, when I look at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: 1 + 3, and then Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 9), and so on, up to Layer 1, which is the outermost. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that. Let me try to parse the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nThe innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So each time, we're computing a new layer by plugging the result of the previous layer into the next one. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we have to multiply that by 3, right?\n\nWait, no. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nIt's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWell, 29524 * 3. Let me compute that step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure.\n\n29524\nx      3\n--------\nMultiply each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, it's 88572.\n\nBut hold on, did I count the layers correctly? Let me recount because I might have miscounted the number of layers, which would affect the result.\n\nLooking back at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen each next layer adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n5. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n6. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n7. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n9. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute it step by step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, each layer is just 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, and each time, the number grows significantly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. It seems like each layer is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term.\n\nIf I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using a formula.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^p = D, a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nD - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that I didn't miscount the layers. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" inside.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So, L_9 is indeed the outermost layer before multiplying by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as each layer being a term in a geometric series. Since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nBut since we're dealing with a recurrence relation, the formula I used earlier is more appropriate.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- The innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4.\n- Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n- This forms a recurrence relation which can be solved to find that each layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n- For n=9, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n- The entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've double-checked each step, and the formula seems to hold. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed sequentially. Using a recurrence relation, it's found that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe result of the computation is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking again, the expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, perhaps I should compute Layer 9 first, but to compute Layer 9, I need Layer 8, and so on. So, it's like a recursive process where each layer depends on the previous one. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Now, 3*9841. Let's compute that: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Therefore, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, that seems like a big number. Let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1, each step is computed correctly. Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but maybe I should check one or two layers again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me check Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is indeed 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524*3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here? Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth layer. Let's see: Starting with Layer 1: 4, which is 3 + 1. Layer 2: 13, which is 1 + 3*4. Layer 3: 40, which is 1 + 3*13. Hmm, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k))*(k)^{n-1} + c/(1 - k), provided that k \u2260 1.\n\nIn this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k = 3 and c = 1. So, applying the formula, a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k))*(k)^{n-1} + c/(1 - k). Plugging in the values: a_1 = 4, c = 1, k = 3.\n\nFirst, compute c/(1 - k): 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2.\n\nThen, compute (a_1 - c/(1 - k)): 4 - (-1/2) = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nSo, the formula becomes a_n = (9/2)*(3)^{n-1} + (-1/2).\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nWe can write this as a_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers we've already computed.\n\nFor n = 1: a_1 = (9*3^{0} - 1)/2 = (9*1 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn = 2: (9*3^{1} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn = 3: (9*3^{2} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn = 4: (9*3^{3} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn = 5: (9*3^{4} - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Wait, but earlier I had Layer 5 as 364. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, no, actually, wait: n in the formula corresponds to the layer number, right? So, if I compute a_5, it should be Layer 5.\n\nWait, no, in the problem, Layer 1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3, so n=1 is Layer 1, which is 4. So, in the formula, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 5 earlier, I got 364, but according to the formula, a_5 should be (9*3^{4} - 1)/2 = (9*81 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Yes, correct. So, a_5 = 364. So, the formula works.\n\nSimilarly, a_6 = (9*3^5 - 1)/2 = (9*243 -1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct, as per earlier.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (9*3^8 - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^8 is 6561. So, 9*6561 = 59049. Then, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value we computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me recap:\n\n- Each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n- Starting from Layer 1: 4.\n- Layer 2: 13.\n- Layer 3: 40.\n- Layer 4: 121.\n- Layer 5: 364.\n- Layer 6: 1093.\n- Layer 7: 3280.\n- Layer 8: 9841.\n- Layer 9: 29524.\n- Multiply by 3: 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: a_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (9*3^8 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the calculations, and the formula checks out with the computed layers. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nWait, actually, looking at the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9, I think. Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer, so from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. Let me confirm that: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then moving outward, each next layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2 using Layer 1, and so on until Layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nAlright, let's start with Layer 1.\n\n**Layer 1: 1 + 3**\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\n**Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)**\nWe know Layer 1 is 4, so plug that in: 1 + 3*4\n3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\n**Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)**\nLayer 2 is 13, so 1 + 3*13\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 = 40.\n\n**Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)**\nLayer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\n**Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)**\nLayer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\n**Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)**\nLayer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364\n3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\n**Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)**\nLayer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093\n3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\n**Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)**\nLayer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280\n3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\n**Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)**\nLayer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841\n3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we take Layer 9, which is 29524, and multiply it by 3.\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8, write down 8.\n- The next digit is 0 (since 29524 is 29524, so no more digits beyond that), but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so actually, that's all the digits. Wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3, each digit:\n\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\n- Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Units digit: 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens digit: 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds digit: 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands digit: 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten thousands digit: 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify this because these numbers are getting quite large, and I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to ensure that I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. That seems manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives us 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3. Let's see:\n\n30000 * 3 = 90000\n476 * 3 = 1428\nSo, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, which was 1 + 3, and Layer 9 as the outermost. Each time, I computed each layer correctly, so I think that's right. Let me recount the layers to be sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer. So, yes, nine layers in total. So, my computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have Layer 9, that would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula saved me from computing each layer manually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there were only nine layers, both methods worked.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the innermost expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I expand it, Layer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) =1 +3 +9\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(1 +3 +9)=1 +3 +9 +27\n\nWait, that's interesting. It seems like each layer adds another term of 3^k.\n\nSo, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Wait, but that's a geometric series.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly the formula I derived earlier. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways now, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the outermost layer is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Wait, no. Looking again, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, I need to compute Layer 1, then use that result in Layer 2, then use Layer 2 in Layer 3, and so on until Layer 9, and then multiply that result by 3. That seems manageable. Let me start computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. Therefore, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nNext, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1,092. Adding 1 gives 1,093. Layer 6 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1,093, so 3*1,093 is 3,279. Adding 1 gives 3,280. Layer 7 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3,280, so 3*3,280 is 9,840. Adding 1 gives 9,841. Layer 8 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9,841, so 3*9,841 is 29,523. Adding 1 gives 29,524. Layer 9 = 29,524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524 times 3: 20,000*3 is 60,000; 9,000*3 is 27,000; 500*3 is 1,500; 24*3 is 72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. So, writing it all together, we get 88,572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6.

Finally, 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nEach step builds on the previous one, so if any step was incorrect, it would carry forward. Let me quickly verify a couple of the layers to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nChecking Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. 3*9,841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Correct.\n\nAnd the final multiplication: 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572. Okay, that seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a geometric series or something similar? Let's see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, each layer a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2,187 -1)/2=2,186/2=1,093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6,561 -1)/2=6,560/2=3,280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19,683 -1)/2=19,682/2=9,841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, the ninth layer is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, as I did initially, but recognizing the pattern allows for a more efficient solution.\n\nIn summary, by either iteratively computing each nested layer or by finding a closed-form expression using recurrence relations, I find that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing this pattern, we can compute each layer step by step or derive a formula to find the result efficiently.\n\n**Step-by-Step Computation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1,093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 3,280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 9,841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 29,524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, okay, that seems manageable. Let me try computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 equals 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3 times Layer 1. Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3 times Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 equals 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3 times Layer 3. Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3 times Layer 4. Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 equals 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3 times Layer 5. Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364. Hmm, 364 times 3. Let me break it down: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3 times Layer 6. Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3 times Layer 7. Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 times Layer 8. Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Since Layer 9 is 29524, we need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final step: 3*29524. Let me compute that again just to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000. 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500. 87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60. 88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n4 * 3 = 12. 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly followed the order of operations. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so each time, it's 3 multiplied by the result of the inner parentheses. I think I did that correctly each time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1\n\nLayer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1\n\nWait, that seems like each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving such recursions.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n} * (a_0 + c/(1 - k)) - c/(1 - k). Wait, but in our case, the initial term is a_1 = 4, and the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, more accurately, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince the original expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me confirm: n=1 is the innermost, so n=9 would be the outermost. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Good.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated before.\n\nBut wait, using the formula, maybe I can find a direct expression for the entire expression without computing each layer.\n\nLet me think. The entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Perfect, that's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, I can directly compute the result as (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, 177147 - 3 is 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively multiplying by 3 and adding 1, but starting from the innermost layer, which is 4. So, each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, leading to the formula I derived earlier.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are 9 layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Calculation**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's get started.\n\n**Layer 1: 1 + 3**\nOkay, the innermost layer is straightforward: 1 + 3. That's simple addition. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\n**Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)**\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13.\n\n**Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)**\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40.\n\n**Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3)**\nContinuing outward, Layer 4 is 1 + 3 times Layer 3. Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121.\n\n**Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4)**\nLayer 5 is 1 + 3 times Layer 4. Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives us 364. So, Layer 5 equals 364.\n\n**Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5)**\nMoving on to Layer 6, it's 1 + 3 times Layer 5. Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives us 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093.\n\n**Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6)**\nNow, Layer 7 is 1 + 3 times Layer 6. Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is... let's see. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so adding those together: 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, adding 1 gives us 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280.\n\n**Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7)**\nNext up is Layer 8, which is 1 + 3 times Layer 7. Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is... 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives us 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841.\n\n**Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)**\nFinally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3 times Layer 8. Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... let's calculate that. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, Layer 9 equals 29524.\n\n**Final Step: 3 times Layer 9**\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we take Layer 9, which is 29524, and multiply it by 3. Let's compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outward, I arrive at the final result of 88,572.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer manually. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, maybe I can use that to find a formula for a_n without computing each term.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the general formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that 88,572 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the expression as a geometric series, each term is multiplied by 3 each time, and there's an added 1 each time. But since it's nested, it's a bit different. The formula I derived using the recurrence relation seems to be the most straightforward way.\n\nIn summary, by either computing each layer step by step or by solving the recurrence relation to find a general formula, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).

Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to slip up. Let me go back through each layer quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3*C => C = 1.5. Therefore, L_n = 1.5*3^n - 0.5. Simplifying, 1.5 is 3/2, so L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. Seems like the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, it's 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 =88572. So, same result. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be extra sure, let me check the recursive formula again. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I could write out the entire expression step by step, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, I could use the closed-form formula to compute directly. Either way, the result is the same. So, I think I'm done here. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Wait, no. Actually, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 1, but Layer 1 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2, and so on. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think. Alternatively, since each layer is similar, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without having to calculate each layer individually, which would take a long time. But perhaps starting with the innermost layer is the way to go, even if it's tedious. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost parentheses. Innermost Layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092, so Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 is 3279, so Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 is 9840, so Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 is 29523, so Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might be confusing. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me compute it step by step: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048, +524 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524*3 should be 88572? Wait, let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it all together: 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But I want to make sure I didn't make any addition mistakes. Let me compute 3*9841 again to see if I get 29523. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4 is 29524. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each time I go out one layer, I increment the layer number. So, Layer 1: innermost, Layer 9: outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that seems correct. Therefore, I think my calculation is correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2, which uses Layer 1:\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGreat, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 uses Layer 2:\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's go to Layer 4:\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, Layer 4 is 121. That's getting bigger quickly. Let me proceed to Layer 5:\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6:\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nWhoa, that's a jump to 1,093. Layer 6 is 1,093. Now, Layer 7:\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 7 is 3,280. Next, Layer 8:\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nThat's a huge number, 9,841. Finally, Layer 9:\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nOkay, so Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so:\nTotal expression: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3 times 29,524. Breaking it down:\n29,524 * 3:\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n24 * 3 = 72\nNow, adding them up:\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to miscalculate with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2705\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2705\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2705\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2705\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2705\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2705\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2705\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2705\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2705\n\nThen, 3*29,524:\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3 again:\n29,524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, 29,524*3=88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nHmm, so each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication is accurate. I think I did this right. So, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to see if there's a quicker way instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the problem had more layers. But since there are only nine layers here, step-by-step computation is manageable.\n\nWait, actually, each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me define it more formally. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3, and for n > 1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nThen, the total is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about solving the recurrence relation for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous recurrence relation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation because of the constant term 1. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant to be determined.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n9/2 = 3C\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2,187\n3^8 = 6,561\n3^9 = 19,683\n3^10 = 59,049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, this method also confirms the result.\n\nThis is reassuring because both methods, the step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation, lead to the same result. It's good to cross-verify, especially with the potential for arithmetic errors when dealing with large numbers.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the value of the expression is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations, so I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 1: } 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2.

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, maybe I should adjust my numbering. Let me think. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (...))). So, the innermost part is the first 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Since there are nine sets of parentheses, that means there are nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait a minute, so Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Hmm, 29524*3. Let me break that down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, and 4*3=12. Wait, that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, adding each part multiplied by 3: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me verify each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't miscalculate any of the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\nCompute 29524*3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct because 29524*3=88572. Let me check using another method, maybe adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = Let's compute that:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 =12, carry over 1.\n\n4 + 2 +1=7.\n\n0 +5=5.\n\n9 +9=18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n5 +2 +1=8.\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the layers, maybe I can compute a couple more layers manually.\n\nWait, for example, Layer 5 is 364, Layer 6 is 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572. So, the problem is solved by computing each nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, and then finally multiplying the outermost result by 3 again.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's get started.\n\n**Layer 1:**\nThe innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\n**Layer 2:**\nNext, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). We already know Layer 1 is 4, so plugging that in: 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\n**Layer 3:**\nMoving outward, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this becomes 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13 gives 39, and adding 1 gives 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\n**Layer 4:**\nLayer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so it's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\n**Layer 5:**\nNext, Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\n**Layer 6:**\nLayer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\n**Layer 7:**\nLayer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. Well, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\n**Layer 8:**\nLayer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\n**Layer 9:**\nFinally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so this becomes 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives 29,524. So, Layer 9 = 29,524.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that calculation for Layer 9 because that's a big number, and I don't want to make a mistake there. So, 3*9841: Let's compute it step by step. 9,841 multiplied by 3.\n\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 800 * 3 = 2,400\n- 40 * 3 = 120\n- 1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400; 29,400 + 120 is 29,520; 29,520 + 3 is 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 is indeed 29,524. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again to be sure. 29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n- 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because I think I might have miscounted the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7        3\n----------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier calculations. It's easy to make an error in arithmetic, especially with so many layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27,000+2,400=29,400, 29,400+120=29,520, 29,520+3=29,523. 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*29,524=88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, after double-checking each layer, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), which resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define each layer more formally. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, the recurrence relation would be:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nwith the base case a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and it might lead to a formula that could compute the nth term directly without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me explore that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is:\n\na_n^{(h)} = C*3^n,\n\nwhere C is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C.\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, the value of the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results to ensure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4:\n\na_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 (the outermost layer):\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation of Layer 9 being 29,524. Perfect.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute the result directly without manually calculating each layer. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since the problem only had nine layers, either method works, though the formula is preferable for more layers or for a general solution.\n\nIn summary, by recognizing the pattern and formulating a recurrence relation, we can derive a closed-form expression to compute the result directly. This approach avoids the tedious step-by-step computation and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\nTherefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can recognize a pattern and use a recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution.

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is... let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093. Let me calculate that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280. Hmm, 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841. Let me compute this step by step. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. So, I think my final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let me try to model this recursion. The general form is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer n-1, with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation: r = 3r, which gives r=0, but that's not helpful. Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The recurrence is Layer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is Layer n^h = C*(3)^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Layer n^p = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = C*(3)^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = C*(3)^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = (3/2)*(3)^n - 1/2. Simplifying, Layer n = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, it would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a geometric progression. Each time, the term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, the expression is essentially building a geometric series. But in this case, since it's nested, the formula approach seems more straightforward. Another way to think about it is that each Layer n is equal to (3^(n+1) -1)/2, as we derived. Therefore, without computing each layer step by step, I can directly compute Layer 9 using the formula and then multiply by 3. Either way, I end up with the same result. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, here's the step-by-step computation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Multiply Layer 9 by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nEach step builds upon the previous one, and using the formula confirms the result. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1.\n\nWait, actually, the standard form is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nTo solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWe can factor this as L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values we computed earlier to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor n = 1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n = 2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n = 3: L(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for any layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L(9). So, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * L(9), and L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which might be faster for larger numbers of layers.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but it's easy to see how the formula would save time, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to make sure everything makes sense:\n\n1. Recognize that the expression is a nested recurrence relation with 9 layers.\n2. Define each layer as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4.\n3. Compute each layer step by step from L_1 up to L_9.\n4. Multiply the final layer by 3 to get the result.\n5. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula for L_n and compute directly.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. I think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 \\) and each subsequent layer is \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nWe can also verify this using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. The general solution for \\( L_n \\) is:\n\n\\[ L(n) = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\n\nFor \\( n = 9 \\):\n\n\\[ L(9) = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Okay, that seems manageable. So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to slip up.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 can be calculated as:\n\n(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, which might be faster or more efficient. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nThis recursive relation can be expressed as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, each layer depends on the previous one.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find A and B.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and assuming L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left-hand side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight-hand side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2) / 3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works for all layers up to n=9. So, that's a good way to compute L_n without having to compute each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L_9. Using the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, so the expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 3^{10} is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048.\n\nThen, 59048 divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572, which is the same result as before. So, this confirms that the final answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can write the entire expression in terms of exponents. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Using the formula, each layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nAlternatively, 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nBecause 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11}, and 3*1 = 3, so it's (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} is 177147. Then, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or express it in terms of exponents, I end up with the same final answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different methods all lead to the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem with a repeating pattern. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using a recursive formula or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series allows us to find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next term})\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1), compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9. But looking back at the original problem, I see that each opening parenthesis is closed with a corresponding ), so maybe there are eight layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses: Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and another parenthesis. Let me see: Starting from the left, the first term is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me count how many layers there are. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and another \"(\", so each layer is a new 1 + 3*(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then moving outward, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me just start computing from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let's write down each step:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but looking back at the original problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n5*3 = 15 +1 =16, write down 6, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 7 7 7 6 2 4?

So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the left:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first layer is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 +3*(...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 +3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, so that means I have 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, my initial calculation of 9 layers is correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, when I computed Layer 1 as 1+3=4, then Layer 2 as 1+3*4=13, Layer 3 as 1+3*13=40, and so on until Layer 9=29524. Then the total expression is 3*29524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nLet me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3a_1, a_3=1+3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, a_1=4\n\na_2=1+3*4=13\n\na_3=1+3*13=40\n\na_4=1+3*40=121\n\na_5=1+3*121=364\n\na_6=1+3*364=1093\n\na_7=1+3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1+3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nSo, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each a_n as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such recursions.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1 is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3=3/2.\n\nThus, a_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nThus, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, as before.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula for the recurrence relation also leads me to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked it, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence relation, we find the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first. 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3.

Let's compute that again: 3*29524. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nHmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute this another way. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me compute this without going through each layer manually. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar because each layer is multiplied by 3. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + r*L_{n-1}, which can be solved using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nIn this case, a = 1, r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = (a*r^{n} - a)/(r - 1). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a + r*L_{n-1}, the solution is L_n = a*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Let me verify that.\n\nLet's test it with n=1: L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Using the formula: a*(r^{1} - 1)/(r - 1) = 1*(3 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (2)/(2) = 1. Wait, that's not correct because L_1 is 4, not 1. Hmm, maybe my formula is off.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is L_n = a*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + c, where c is a constant. Alternatively, maybe I should derive it properly.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as we calculated earlier.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nGiven that, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because the number seems quite large. Let me compute 3^10 again just to be sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 *3.\n\nLet me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding them together: 60000 +27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers up to Layer 9, which equals 29524, we multiply this result by 3 to get the final value of 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

So, the result is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. I think that's the answer.
