Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me verify my computations for each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug the recurrence into this form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. On the other hand, a_n = C*3^n + D. Therefore, equating both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572. This method confirms the result we obtained by step-by-step computation. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\\) with the initial condition \\(a_1 = 4\\), we can derive a closed-form formula for \\(a_n\\). This formula helps us compute the value of the innermost layers efficiently. After calculating each layer up to the ninth, we find that the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Wait, let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me verify each step because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4 (as computed above). So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, solving the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's similar to a base-3 number or something, but I think the step-by-step computation is straightforward enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. But we also have L_n = A*3^n + B. Therefore, equating the two expressions: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression, it's like a geometric series with ratio 3, but I need to see how that works. Let me try to expand the entire expression step by step. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's denote the innermost part as S. S = 1 + 3. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*S. Then, the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*S) = 1 + 3 + 3*3*S = 1 + 3 + 9*S. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps each layer adds another term when expanded. Let me see. If I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try expanding step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Correct.\n\nThen, finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that could have been recognized earlier, so that we don't have to compute each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we had. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, and the nonhomogeneous part is the constant term 1.\n\nThe characteristic equation for the homogeneous part is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, and even found a general formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000; 9000 + 9000 = 18000; 500 + 500 = 1000; 20 + 20 = 40; 4 + 4 = 8. So adding up: 40000 + 18000 = 58000; 58000 + 1000 = 59000; 59000 + 40 = 59040; 59040 + 8 = 59048. Now, add the third 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 29524.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: As computed earlier, 88572. So, I think my computations are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this computation without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), which is a form of a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it as such. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the values. For n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, I can set up a system of equations: 3A + B = 4, 9A + B = 13. Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. That's much faster and reduces the chance of error. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check this multiplication because I want to be absolutely sure. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's correct. So, 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 Layer 9\n2. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 Layer 8\n3. And so on, until the innermost is Layer 1.\n\nWait, so actually, the innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then, each layer wraps around that, so the next one is Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 9 layers in total. So, my earlier calculation was correct with 9 layers, ending up with 29524 for Layer 9, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me write out the structure:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3 * [1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))))]\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3 * (...)\" is a layer, starting from the innermost as (1 + 3). So, let's see:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So, my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, maybe I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nLet me try to find a general formula for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as we computed earlier.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which confirms the result.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations with exponents, let me compute 3^10 again:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^10 is indeed 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute 3*29524 using another method. Let's break down 29524 into parts:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that adds up correctly. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by computing each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\), with the innermost layer \\( a_1 = 4 \\). After computing each layer up to \\( a_9 = 29524 \\), we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Compute each layer:**\n   - \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it all together: 88572. Let me check that multiplication again: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the layers again or see if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nIn fact, this looks like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis kind of recurrence can be solved using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1.\n\nIn this case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the general formula would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) * d.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so perhaps a_0 would be 1? Let me see: If n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. If a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. So, using a_0 = 1, then for n=9, a_9 = 3^9 * a_0 + (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) * 1.\n\nCompute that:\n\n3^9 is 19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = 19683 * 1 + (19683 - 1)/2 * 1 = 19683 + (19682)/2 = 19683 + 9841 = 29524. That's the same as Layer 9 earlier. So, that's consistent.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems to confirm my earlier calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, perhaps I can compute the layers again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expression from the inside out without labeling the layers, just to see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nStart with 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 121.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(121) = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1 repeatedly. The expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of a geometric series, which is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. However, in this case, each term is built by the previous term, so it's a bit different, but the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nIn any case, after computing each layer step by step, and verifying with the recurrence formula, I arrive at the same answer each time. Therefore, I'm pretty sure that the final result is 88572.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\n3. Compute each layer up to the ninth one, which gives 29524.\n\n4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and the multiple methods I used all point to the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer one by one:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Hmm, that seems right. But wait, I'm a bit confused because when I compute each layer, the numbers are growing exponentially. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer step by step. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for n=0, L_0 would be undefined in this context, but maybe we can consider the homogeneous solution. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute L_n in terms of L_{n-1} iteratively, which is what I did earlier. But since I've already computed up to L_9 and got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but let me check once more. Maybe I can compute the layers again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where each layer is (3^{n} - 1)/2 or something similar, but I think for the purposes of this problem, computing each layer step by step is sufficient.\n\nWait, another thought: Let me see if each layer can be expressed as (3^{n} + 1)/2, where n is the layer number. Let's test this.\n\nFor Layer 1: n=1, (3^1 +1)/2 = (3+1)/2 = 4/2 = 2. But Layer 1 is 4, so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe it's (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2=4.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote the nth layer as L_n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think this method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is larger, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. But for nine layers, either method works. I'm glad I checked using both the step-by-step computation and the formula; it gives me confidence that the answer is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me quickly recap: Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from 4. The formula for the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that's (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Multiply by 3: 88572. Yep, that all adds up. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe denote each layer as \\(L_n\\), where \\(L_1 = 1 + 3\\). Each subsequent layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_{n-1}\\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - \\(L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - \\(L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - \\(L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - \\(L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - \\(L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - \\(L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - \\(L_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n2. The outermost expression is \\(3 \\cdot L_9\\):\n   - \\(3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Wait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when I multiply by 3, starting from units: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next, 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next, 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next, 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next, 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4.

Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost layers up to the ninth layer, which results in 29524, the entire expression is then multiplied by 3, yielding the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result in the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, writing it all together: 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 2? Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: digits are 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step because I don't want to make a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any errors in computing each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.

Yes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times ...), so the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a recursive formula. Maybe I can express this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me think about it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4.\n\na_2 =1 +3*a_1=1+12=13.\n\na_3=1 +3*a_2=1+39=40.\n\na_4=1 +3*a_3=1+120=121.\n\na_5=1 +3*a_4=1+363=364.\n\na_6=1 +3*a_5=1+1092=1093.\n\na_7=1 +3*a_6=1+3279=3280.\n\na_8=1 +3*a_7=1+9840=9841.\n\na_9=1 +3*a_8=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, this recursive relation can be modeled as a linear recurrence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: a_1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2 works for each layer. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series without defining each a_n. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer adds a term of 3^k, perhaps. Let me try to expand the expression step by step to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 +3=4.\n\nThen, 1 +3*(4)=13.\n\nThen, 1 +3*(13)=40.\n\nThen, 1 +3*(40)=121.\n\nThen, 1 +3*(121)=364.\n\nThen, 1 +3*(364)=1093.\n\nThen, 1 +3*(1093)=3280.\n\nThen, 1 +3*(3280)=9841.\n\nThen, 1 +3*(9841)=29524.\n\nThen, 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see.\n\nEach time we have 1 +3*(...), which can be thought of as 1 +3*previous term. So, each layer adds a term that's 3 times the previous, plus 1. So, perhaps the total expression can be represented as a sum where each term is 3^k, but I need to see how many terms there are.\n\nWait, considering that each layer adds a 3^k term, maybe the expansion would be something like 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... )))=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nBut perhaps if I expand it, I can write it as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Hmm, this seems redundant. Maybe I can think of it as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding the entire expression without the outermost 3 first.\n\nLet me denote E = 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, E = 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me compute E step by step:\n\nE = 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me compute the innermost part first: Let's say the innermost expression is 1 +3 =4. Then moving out, each layer is 1 +3*previous.\n\nAs computed earlier, E would be equal to a_9 =29524.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*E, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express E as a sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 +3*(previous), and the previous layer can be expressed similarly, it's like each term is 3^{k} where k starts from 0 up to 9, but I need to check.\n\nWait, when I computed a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, and for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, so 3^{10}=59049. Then, the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to compute it directly without computing each layer. That's clever. So, the formula is (3^{n+1} -1)/2 for the innermost expression after n layers, and then multiplied by 3 gives (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nIn this case, since there are 9 layers, n=9, so it's (3^{11} -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, that's a much faster way to compute it without going through each layer. But I guess for someone just starting out, breaking it down layer by layer is a good approach to avoid mistakes.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that formula again. If a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2.\n\nYes, because 3*(3^{n+1})=3^{n+2}, and 3*1=3, so 3*(3^{n+1}-1)=3^{n+2}-3, then divided by 2.\n\nSo, with n=9 layers, it's (3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it multiple ways now, both by computing each layer step by step and by using the formula for the geometric series. Both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Because if I messed up any layer, the entire answer would be off. Let me recalculate each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1 into the general solution: a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, let's find a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution for n=2: a_2 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B = 13. Now we have two equations: 3A + B = 4, and 9A + B = 13. Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form formula. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, ensuring each result was correct. 3. After computing the innermost layers up to Layer 9, multiply by 3 as per the original expression. 4. To double-check, I derived a closed-form formula for the recursive sequence, which confirmed that Layer 9 is indeed 29524, leading to the final answer of 88572. So, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different methods (step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula) both lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward.

Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or can be modeled using recursion. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which matches Layer 1. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is Layer 2. So, indeed, each a_n is defined as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can model this as a linear recurrence relation. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0, assuming a_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so maybe the initial term is a_0 = 1. Let me check. If a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Correct. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. So, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me test that. For n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that's not matching. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check: For n=0: (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. Correct, a_0 = 1. For n=1: (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct, a_1 = 4. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13. Correct, a_2 = 13. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40. Correct, a_3 = 40. So, yes, the general formula seems to be a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that matches my previous result. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each layer being a term in a geometric sequence, and the total expression is 3 times the 9th term of this sequence. Since each a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, so 3*a_9 = 88572. This approach seems more efficient, avoiding computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, computing each step is manageable, though time-consuming. I think I've confirmed the result in multiple ways now, so I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me find the closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 \u2192 B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, layer n has value a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, and the outermost layer is layer 9. So, the outermost expression before multiplying by the initial 3 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, 3*364 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 is 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 93*3=279; so 3,000 + 279 = 3,279. Then 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840; so 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000; 841*3=2,523. So, 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to see if there's a quicker way without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term depends on the next. Let me try to represent this recursively. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. We can compute a_2, a_3, ..., up to a_9. Wait, but that's exactly what I did earlier. So, perhaps there's a formula for a_n in terms of a geometric progression. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer is a_n as defined. But wait, in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). Because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is 3*a_9. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 =59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n =1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... )) which is similar to 1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +... up to some terms, but because it's nested, it's not exactly a simple geometric series. However, using the formula we derived, it's clear that each a_n is related to 3^{n+1}, which is why the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2 works. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a geometric series. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation.

So, I think the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this problem as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if that approach works. Let's define the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n*a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, so c=3, d=1. The initial term a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, in the standard form, the recurrence starts at n=0, but here, our first term is a_1. Let me adjust the indices. Let me consider a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Then, for n >= 2, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The solution to this can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, all the steps check out, and the final answer is 88572. I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This pattern continues for nine layers, and the final result is multiplied by 3.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each layer: 1 + 3*previous layer. So Layer 1:4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3a_1, a_3=1+3a_2, and so on up to a_9. So the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of terms, computing each step is manageable. However, for the sake of thoroughness, let me try to find a closed-form expression to see if my computations are correct. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C =1 \u2192 C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then verified using a closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, and both methods gave the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, all the steps check out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, the expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + (b/(a - 1)). So, substituting, L_n = C*3^n + (1/(3 - 1)) = C*3^n + 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 + 1/2 = 3C + 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2. Therefore, C = (7/2)/3 = 7/6. Thus, the general formula is L_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (7/6)*3 + 1/2 = (7/6)*3 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 1/2 = 10.5 + 0.5 = 11. Wait, but earlier I calculated L_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, my general formula might be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me double-check the general solution for such a recurrence. The standard approach for a recurrence relation L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - a*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n = C*a^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (b=1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p. Substituting into the recurrence: L_p = a*L_p + b. Solving for L_p: L_p - a*L_p = b => L_p*(1 - a) = b => L_p = b/(1 - a). Wait, in this case, a=3, so L_p = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, which matches my earlier calculation. n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct again. So, the general formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. That's a neat formula. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the general formula, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct answer. Alternatively, I can compute 3^{10} directly and then apply the formula. 3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, 3^{10} is 59049. Then, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the general formula, I get the same answer.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, the result is 88572. Hmm, but let me verify that computation again because sometimes when I'm multiplying step by step, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a geometric series. Let me recall the formula. For a recurrence relation a_n = r*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + d/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} - d/(1 - r). Wait, no, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me write down the first few terms to see the pattern. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\nK - 3K = 1\n-2K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Let me just check once more by computing the layers step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, all these layers check out. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. I think that's solid. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since the numbers are manageable, step-by-step computation seems feasible. Another approach might be to recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested multiplication. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, I can think of this as a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with our earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, I could have computed a_9 directly without computing each layer, which would have saved time. But since I was just starting out, computing each layer step by step was a good way to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. It's always good to verify using a different method if possible. So, in summary, by either expanding each layer step by step or by finding a general formula for the nth layer, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. Layer 2: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n3. Layer 3: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n4. Layer 4: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n5.

That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Wait, let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The base case is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, layer 9, which is the innermost layer, would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, but earlier I computed a_9 as 29524. Let's compute (3^{10} - 1)/2: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Yes, that's correct. So, layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Ten-thousands place is 8.\n\nSo putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, earlier when I was computing the layers, I got Layer 9 as 29524, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). But let me double-check each layer computation because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLet me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final result. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the layers. Maybe I can compute a few layers again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication is accurate. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but in this case, a = 3, and b = 1. Wait, let me check: Our recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, yes, a = 3, b = 1. So, the general solution would be L_n = 3^{n} * C + (1)/(1 - 3). Wait, but 1/(1 - 3) is -1/2. Hmm, but let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^{n}. Then, find a particular solution. Let's assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Alternatively, maybe I can find an expression for the entire original expression in terms of 3^{10} or something. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. I think I've thoroughly checked this now, both by step-by-step computation and by using the recurrence relation formula.

Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, maybe that's a more efficient way. Let me try that approach. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with the initial condition a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, we can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I've checked it both by computing each layer step by step and by using the recurrence relation formula, and both methods led me to the same answer.

So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that gives 88572.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each \"(\" adds another layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Let's see: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. From the innermost, each time we have a \"1+3(\", so let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, wrapping that: 1+3(1+3)\n\nThen wrapping that: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nSo, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\" because each \"(\" adds a new layer. Wait, no, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, but then each of these has a corresponding closing parenthesis. So, actually, the innermost one is 1+3, and each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, if I count the number of layers, it's 9 layers because there are 9 \"1+3(\" instances. Therefore, I correctly computed up to Layer 9, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which can be solved using the formula for a geometric series. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0, but in this case, a_1 = 4, so let me adjust accordingly. Wait, perhaps I can derive it step by step. Let me write down the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked each step, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each layer was computed correctly, and the formula for a_n confirms that the 9th layer is indeed 29524, leading to the final answer of 88572 when multiplied by 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer} \\).

Hmm, but when I did the initial step-by-step, I thought of 3*(Layer 9) as 3*29524, which is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I have nine layers, that's correct. Each layer is built by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and so on. So, yes, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c can be found using standard techniques. In this case, k=3 and c=1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the formula for such a recurrence, we find that each layer \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Adding units: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Tens: 4 + 2 = 6 +1=7. Hundreds: 0 +5=5. Thousands: 9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1. Ten thousands: 5 +2=7 +1=8. So, 88572. Yes, that matches. So 29524 *3=88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B +1 => B -3B=1 => -2B=1 => B=-1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since each layer follows L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the outermost layer is L_9, and the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, I get 88572 as the final answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000; 9000 + 9000 = 18000; 500 + 500 = 1000; 20 + 20 = 40; 4 + 4 = 8. So total is 40000 + 18000 = 58000; 58000 + 1000 = 59000; 59000 + 40 = 59040; 59040 + 8 = 59048.

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a recursive sequence. Let me write down the first few terms to see if there's a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, the sequence goes 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for such recursions. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} + c/(1 - k). Wait, in this case, k is 3 and c is 1. Let me check that formula. Alternatively, I can solve it using the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula instead of expanding each layer. But either way, the result is the same. So, I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier when computing the layers.

So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3\u00d729524, which is 88572. Hmm, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly because the original expression has nine 1+3(1+3...) sections, right? Let me count the number of times 1+3( starts:\n\nStarting from the innermost:  \n1+3(  \nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(, so from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, the computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWe can solve for A and B using the initial condition and the recurrence.\n\nFirst, let's substitute n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4.\n\nAlso, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's express a_n using the general solution:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nSimilarly, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)  \nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, LHS: A*3^n + B  \nRHS: 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1  \nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n3A + B = 4  \n3A - 1/2 = 4  \n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, for n=9, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm:\n\n3^1=3  \n3^2=9  \n3^3=27  \n3^4=81  \n3^5=243  \n3^6=729  \n3^7=2187  \n3^8=6561  \n3^9=19683  \n3^10=59049.

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the digit positions because 29524 has 5 digits, so when multiplying by 3, the result should be 5 digits as well, but 88572 is 5 digits, which seems correct. Let me confirm with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I feel like I might have missed something because the numbers are growing so quickly, but each step seems to add up correctly. Let me try computing one more layer to see if the pattern holds. For example, let's say I have only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Compute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 3*(4) = 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Let me compute that: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Yes, that's correct. Now, if I have three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Wait, no, that's the same as two layers. Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step again. Wait, no, actually, three layers would be: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. So, yes, that's correct. So, each additional layer increases the value significantly, as each time you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which leads to exponential growth. So, going back, after computing up to Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading to Layer 9 being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
