    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that multiplication: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, actually, let me check that. The standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, so yes, our case is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution B, so plugging in: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the recurrence relation. That's pretty cool because it avoids having to compute each layer manually, especially if there are many layers. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, it's manageable. I think both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to be thorough, let me try computing a couple more layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, using the formula for a_9, we get 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in calculation. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting with a_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, the value is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the formula gives a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{9+1}-1)/2 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we determine that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait a second, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check that because if that's wrong, everything else is off. Let's go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, but I just did that multiplication and got 88572, but I'm a bit unsure because the number seems large. Let me try another way to confirm. Let's compute 29524 * 3 using another method, maybe breaking it down: 29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Now multiply each by 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me just make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine layers, right? Let me count the opening parentheses: Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. Let me count them: The innermost is Layer 1: (1+3). Then each subsequent layer wraps around that, so up to Layer 9. So yes, Layer 9 is the outermost one, which we computed as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, I just thought of something. When I computed Layer 9, I assumed that it was 1 + 3*(Layer 8). But in the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on until Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, I think I've done this correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me verify this multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step checks out, and the formula approach confirms it. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. So, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me just think again: each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are nine layers. So, each time, we're multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a geometric series, but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Suppose we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))). This is similar to a continued fraction or a recursive sequence. In fact, if we have multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer), then each layer can be represented as a function of the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, whose solution is L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my previous result. Alternatively, if I had used the formula for L_n, I could have directly computed L_9 and then multiplied by 3. Either way, the result is the same. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me try computing one more layer using the formula to see if it aligns. Let's take n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which is exactly what I calculated earlier. So, the formula is reliable. Therefore, I can trust that L_9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the process. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a linear recurrence relation.

So, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recurrence relation here.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer, where k=1 is the innermost.\n\nThen, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_k.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me think. The recurrence is L_k = 3*L_{k-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution would be L_k^{(h)} = C*3^{k}, and a particular solution would be a constant, say D. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nD = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_k = C*3^{k} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check if this formula works for the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nk=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nk=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nk=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121.

So, L_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for L_k, since the outer expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11} first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Exactly the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result, so that's reassuring.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation: r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 + 1/2 = 3A \u21d2 9/2 = 3A \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost layer is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach gave me the same answer. So I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, that seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of expression, so I don't have to compute each layer manually every time. Let me think. This expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. It looks like a geometric series but nested. Wait, maybe I can express it recursively. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the first few terms would be: a1 = 4, a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The standard approach for such a recurrence is to solve the homogeneous equation and find a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I have: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is the 9th layer, which is a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. So, let's compute a9 first: a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, using the formula is much faster and less error-prone. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in calculation. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a nested multiplication where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this recursively. The general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've covered all the steps, checked my work, and even derived a general formula to confirm the result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think I'm good to go.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364.

So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, after checking each layer, I'm confident that each step was computed correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps using a formula for a geometric series or something similar, since each term seems to be a multiple of the previous one. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach also leads us to the same answer, which gives me even more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and adding 1, so it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an added constant. But in this case, since it's a finite number of layers, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation.\n3. After computing all layers up to Layer 9, multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n4. Double-check using a recurrence relation approach to confirm the result.\n\nThis process helps ensure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way, especially since the numbers can get quite large as we go outwards.\n\nAnother thing I might consider is whether there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, computing each step is manageable, albeit time-consuming.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is correct. It's always good to verify using different methods to catch any possible mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4.

Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Let's assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, let's equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, A = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer without having to compute each layer step by step. That was a bit quicker, but I think it's good that I did both methods to confirm the answer. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, I found that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572. Alternatively, recognizing the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form formula allowed me to compute the same result more efficiently. Either way, the answer is the same, so I'm confident that 88,572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524.

Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. Here, c=3, d=1. The solution is a_n = c^n * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me recall the formula. For a recurrence relation a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). But in our case, the recurrence starts at a_1 = 4, so maybe a_0 is not defined. Alternatively, maybe we can adjust the indices. Let me see. Let's define a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc. So, if we set a_0 = 1, then the general solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) * d. Wait, because the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, d=1. So, substituting, a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2 * 1. Since a_0 = 1, this becomes a_n = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2. Simplifying, a_n = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\). Using the formula for such a recurrence, we determine that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: 4\n- Layer 2: 13\n- Layer 3: 40\n- Layer 4: 121\n- Layer 5: 364\n- Layer 6: 1093\n- Layer 7: 3280\n- Layer 8: 9841\n- Layer 9: 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Wait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 (tens) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a function of the previous term. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 =4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula and see if they match my earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=4. Correct. n=2: (27-1)/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final computation is 3*29524=88572. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the reasoning or calculations.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By solving each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) follows the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}\\) with \\(L_1 = 4\\). This recurrence can be solved using a formula, leading to \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the 9th layer, \\(L_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, let me check that again:\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Let's add them:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Did I correctly compute Layer 9 as 29524? Let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(...), where the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3*(...). So, actually, there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost. So, maybe I should count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, it's 1+3(...), so let's count the number of times 1+3 appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost, each layer is one more 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there are nine 1+3 terms, each wrapped in another layer. So, that's nine layers, each time adding 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my earlier computation was correct, with Layer 1 being the innermost 1+3, and Layer 9 being the outermost before multiplying by 3.\n\nSo, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the expression.\n\nStarting from the beginning: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time after the 1+, there's a (, which starts a new layer. Let's count the number of ( after 1+3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...3(1+3(...\n3. ...3(1+3(...\n4. ...3(1+3(...\n5. ...3(1+3(...\n6. ...3(1+3(...\n7. ...3(1+3(...\n8. ...3(1+3(...\n9. ...3(1+3)))\n\nSo, there are nine sets of parentheses, meaning nine layers. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost before multiplying by 3.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and building up to a_9, then multiplying by 3. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous term. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let's define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis matches what I got earlier, so I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here because each term is defined recursively, not as a sum of a geometric progression. However, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nTherefore, equating both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method also leads us to the same result, confirming that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but since each term also adds 1, it's more of a linear recurrence rather than a simple geometric series. However, by finding the closed-form expression, we can compute it directly without iterating through each layer, which is useful if we have a large number of layers.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute a few layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers check out. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think I've verified this multiple times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct. It's always good to double-check each step, especially when dealing with nested expressions and multiple layers of computation. It's easy to make a small arithmetic error somewhere, but by systematically verifying each layer, I can ensure that each step is correct before moving on to the next. Additionally, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression provided another way to confirm the result, which is a good practice when dealing with such problems.\n\nAnother thing I might consider is whether there's a formula for such nested expressions in general. As I did earlier, by expressing it as a recurrence relation, I can find a general term, which is useful. In this case, since the number of layers is finite (nine), it's manageable, but if it were, say, 20 layers, computing each step would be tedious, and having a closed-form formula would be much more efficient.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, computing each layer step by step, and verifying each computation, I arrived at the solution. Additionally, by recognizing the pattern and using recurrence relations, I confirmed the result in another way, which added to my confidence in the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the outermost layer before the final multiplication is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So putting it all together: 8 (from 2*3+2), then 8 (from 9*3+1), 5 (from 5*3), 7 (from 2*3+1), and 2 (from 4*3). So that gives 88572. Wait, let me verify that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it out:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n----------  \nStarting from the rightmost digit: 4\u00d73=12, so write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that using another method. Let's compute 30000 \u00d73 = 90000. Then, 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 3 \u00d729524 = 3\u00d7(30000 - 476) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and make sure I computed each layer correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers earlier on. Let me recompute each layer step by step to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3\u00d729524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find D, we can set a_n = D, so D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 \u21d2 -2D = 1 \u21d2 D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see the pattern in the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 40 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 121 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 121.\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9: (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, that's a more efficient way to compute it, using the formula instead of computing each layer manually. But since I was doing it step by step, I think the initial method was correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate one step and throw off the entire result.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) \n\nWait, so each layer adds another 3(...). So, in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9, but perhaps the total number of layers is 9, meaning that after computing Layer 9, we multiply by 3. So, yes, 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572. But let me make sure that I correctly identified the number of layers. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n2. Next layer: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) \n\nSo, yes, that's 9 layers. So, Layer 1 is 1+3=4, Layer 2 is 1+3*4=13, up to Layer 9=29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29,524=88,572. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't skip any layers or count incorrectly. Another way to approach this is to recognize that this is a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, let's compute a few terms to see if this matches my earlier calculations.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, a_9 = 29,524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + d, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions, and d is a particular solution.\n\nTo find d, we can assume that the particular solution is a constant, so let d = k. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nk = 1 + 3*k\n\nSolving for k:\n\nk - 3k = 1 \u2192 -2k = 1 \u2192 k = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so a_9 = 29,524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, the total expression would be 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result again.\n\nWait, another thought: Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have 9 layers, the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, starting from the innermost term.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression step by step, perhaps writing it out fully.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute from the inside out:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. The next layer out is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times this value: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with all previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 successively. Let me try to express the entire expression in terms of powers of 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds a term that's 3^n.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 3*3 + 3*1 = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13.\n\nWait, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1=4, a_2=13, etc., as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, using the closed-form solution, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the entire expression as 3*(sum of a geometric series).\n\nWait, but I think the way I approached it earlier is sufficient. Each step builds on the previous one, so working from the inside out is the most straightforward method here.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute the expression again step by step, just in case I made any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent every time I compute it.\n\nWait, another way to think about this: Each time you add a layer, you're effectively multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. So, starting from 1, each layer is 3*previous +1. So, for 9 layers, it's like building up the number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each layer is equivalent to (3^{n} -1)/2, as we saw earlier. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but 3^{10} is 59,049, right? Let me confirm that: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've verified this enough times. Each step seems consistent, and the arithmetic checks out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. To solve it, we compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinal step: Multiply Layer 9 by 3.\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Okay, that's consistent. So 29524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final answer should be 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems right. Wait, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each time you go out, you add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Starting from the innermost: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the inside out: Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, then inside that is 1 + 3(...), which is 9 layers deep? Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to parse it properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of times 1 + 3( occurs. Let me write it out:\n\nStarting from the outermost: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of these. Starting from the first 1 + 3(...), that's the first layer. Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...), so that's the second, and so on until the innermost. Let me count them:\n\n1. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \u2013 outermost\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \u2013 next layer\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n9. 1 + 3))))))))) \n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So each time, I computed up to Layer 9, which gives 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. Hmm, but let me check again if the number of layers is correct because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nWait, another way: The expression is 3 followed by 8 sets of (1 + 3(...)). Because the structure is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with 8 opening parentheses after the first 3. So, that would mean 8 layers. Wait, no, actually, the expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and inside that, it's another 3(1 + 3(...)), so each time we have another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost out, it's 1 + 3 (Layer 1), then 1 + 3(Layer 1) (Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9, which would be the outermost before the initial 3. So, yes, 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3(...). So, my initial computation is correct, with Layer 9 being 29,524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller version to see if my approach is correct. Let's say we have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let me compute that manually to see if my method works.\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, outermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my method works for this smaller version, giving 120. So, applying the same method to the larger problem should be correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and finally multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order.\n\nWait, when multiplying, we start from the rightmost digit and move left, writing each digit as we go. So, the result should be:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 + 1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n- Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from left to right as we computed them: 8 (from ten-thousands), 8 (from thousands), 5 (from hundreds), 7 (from tens), 2 (from units).

Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think about this expression as a geometric series or some kind of recursive pattern. Maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested expression where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. This seems similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) But inside the parentheses, it's the same structure as E, except without the initial 3. Wait, actually, if I let each layer be a term, then each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, as I computed earlier, L_9 = 29524, so 3*L_9 = 88572. Alternatively, I can model this as a recurrence relation where L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving it that way. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's solve the homogeneous equation first: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution L_n^p. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the initial layers: For n = 1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for n = 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). By computing each layer step by step or using a recurrence relation formula, we find that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go back and check each layer step by step again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So that seems right. Hmm, maybe it's correct after all. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula or a pattern that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, which would be time-consuming, especially if there are many layers. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical pattern or a recursive formula that can be applied here. The expression inside each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_9. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for L_n. Let's see:\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result.\n\nSo, either way, the result is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that the answer is correct. I didn't make any arithmetic errors in my step-by-step computation, and the formula approach also leads to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by recognizing the nested pattern in the expression. The expression is a repeated structure where each term is \\(1 + 3\\) times another similar expression. We can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nThe given expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\(L_n\\), where \\(n\\) is the layer number starting from the innermost. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost layers, we find that Layer 9 is 29524. The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here to compute this more efficiently instead of calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I could recognize that this expression is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. a_2 =1 +3*a_1 =1 +12=13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40. a_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +120=121. a_5=1 +3*a_4=1 +363=364. a_6=1 +3*a_5=1 +1092=1093. a_7=1 +3*a_6=1 +3279=3280. a_8=1 +3*a_7=1 +9840=9841. a_9=1 +3*a_8=1 +29523=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Substituting the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's expand the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B =1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B =1 => B= -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1= A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) =4. So, 3A -1/2=4 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the initial terms. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9, so n=9. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's consistent with what I calculated earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, just to be absolutely sure. Let me write out each step again, making sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.

So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but given that each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using a formula for repeated multiplication. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The general form for such a recurrence is L_n = a*r^{n} + b, where r is the common ratio and b is a constant. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4. First, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start. Since the expression has 9 layers, each corresponding to L_1 up to L_9. Wait, actually, in the problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is L_1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*(29524) = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward, recognizing a pattern that allows us to use a recurrence relation.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but given the number of layers, it might make sense. Let me just verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer individually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might save time. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier calculation. Therefore, the outer expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because that's a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the intermediate steps. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula that can represent this without having to compute each layer manually. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 =1 +3=4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1, a_1=4; n=2, a_2=13; n=3, a_3=40; and so on, up to a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, the general formula for such a linear recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1, but a_1=4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe the formula is different. Let me try to find the closed-form solution for a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=1. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form A. Substituting into the recurrence: A =1 +3*A => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3=3/2. Therefore, a_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9, which is the 9th term. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.

So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,7,5,2. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because sometimes when I do multiplication step by step, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 another way. 29524 \u00d7 3 can be broken down as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 30000 \u00d7 3 - 476 \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That matches, so I think that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer from 1 to 9 was computed as:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 \u00d7 Layer 9, which is 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Correct.\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, for n=0, if I consider a_0, but in our case, the first term is a_1=4, which is 1+3. So, maybe n starts at 1.\n\nBut let me see if I can find a pattern.\n\nCompute a few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, the entire expression can be written as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same result.\n\nThis makes me confident that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check the formula again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the general solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nAssume particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the equation: K = 3*K + 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Correct.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression as starting with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) and so on, it's essentially 3*a_9, where a_9 is the 9th term in the sequence defined by the recurrence.\n\nSo, I think I've arrived at the correct answer by both step-by-step computation and by finding a closed-form solution using the recurrence relation. Both methods lead me to the same result, which is 88572.\n\nJust to make absolutely sure, let me compute each layer once again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations this time.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That all checks out. So, I think I've got the right answer here. It was a bit tedious with all those layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I didn't make any calculation errors that I can see, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, writing it all together: 8 (from the first carry), then 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. 29524 * 3: Let's compute each digit step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the ten-thousands place: 8, then thousands: 8, hundreds: 5, tens: 7, units: 2. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that seems correct because 30000 * 3 is 90000, so 29524 * 3 should be a bit less, like 88572. Let me verify with another method: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Adding them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of each layer is as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, so that seems right. But let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, with nested expressions like this, especially where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), you can find a geometric series or some recursive formula. Let me think about this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 =177144. Then, 177144 /2=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then recognized a pattern and derived a formula to confirm the result. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using a derived formula, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"
