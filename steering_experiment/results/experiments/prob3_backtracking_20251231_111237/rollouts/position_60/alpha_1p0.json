Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), whose solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me verify with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L(3)= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9, so L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9)= (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe label each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nTo verify, we use the recurrence relation \\(L(n) = 1 + 3L(n-1)\\) with \\(L(1) = 4\\).

So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you compute layer by layer, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in any step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, computing up to a_9, and then multiplying by 3. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. So, we have: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. Subtract C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Now, solve for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result without computing each layer step by step. That was a good check. It's reassuring that both methods give the same answer. So, I can be confident that the result is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a closed-form formula for the sequence, we confirm that the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct because 30000 *3=90000, and 29524 is 476 less than 30000. So 90000 - (476*3)=90000 - 1428=88572. Okay, so that checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me retrace my steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since the expression isn't too long, manually computing each layer is feasible. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to represent this. Each layer is of the form: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, which also gave me the same result. So, either way, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can compute each layer step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.

The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), and each time another (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first ( is after 3, then each subsequent ( is inside another layer. Let me count them: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 9, because each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Wait, but in my earlier computation, I only went up to Layer 9, but perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check: Each time I compute a layer, I'm moving one step outward. So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, my computation of Layer 1 to Layer 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By iteratively computing each layer up to the ninth, we find \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer:\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So putting it together: 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

But wait, did I count the layers correctly? Let me double-check. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the innermost is the last (1+3), then each preceding one adds another layer. Let me count the number of 3(1+3(\u2026): Each \"3(\" is a new layer. So, the first is 3(...), then inside that is another 3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of 3s before the first 1+3. Wait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me write them out: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a recurrence relation. Let me try that approach. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let\u2019s say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, if I compute up to a_9, that would be the innermost part, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me compute a_1 to a_9: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That matches my earlier calculation. So, I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing one more layer to see if the pattern holds. For example, let's compute a_3 again: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Yes, that's correct. And a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, which is 1 + 120. Correct. So, the pattern seems consistent.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term being 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with both methods. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer, but since I didn't think of it at first, I just did it step by step. It's good to verify using both methods to ensure that I didn't make a mistake. So, I think the answer is 88572. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 would be larger. Wait, perhaps I messed up the place values. Let me try again: 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider the general form: Let's say we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but in this case, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if the formula holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. But wait, a_1 is 4, not 1. Hmm, so perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2. Let's test that. For n=1: (3^{2} - 3)/2 = (9 - 3)/2 = 6/2 = 3. Not matching a_1=4. Hmm, maybe another approach. Let's solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result we got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we found earlier. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's see, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, which we've now determined is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ). So, 3*( (59049 - 1)/2 ) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward and recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we can solve it efficiently. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the recurrence relation formula, we find that \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the given problem with 9 layers, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is built upon the previous one. Let me consider the general form of such a nested expression. Suppose we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))), which is a finite nested expression. In this case, a = 1, and b = 3, and the nesting happens 9 times, but in our problem, the outermost term is multiplied by 3 as well. Wait, actually, let me check: the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), except the innermost layer which is just 1 + 3. So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, another way to think about it is that each layer is defined recursively as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for L_n. Let's list out the values we have so far: L_1 = 4 L_2 = 13 L_3 = 40 L_4 = 121 L_5 = 364 L_6 = 1093 L_7 = 3280 L_8 = 9841 L_9 = 29524 Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recurrence relation here. Each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*(3)^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*(3)^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572, as I calculated earlier. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the exponentiation, let me verify 3^10 and 3^11. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 3^11=177147 Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524, times 3 is 88572. So, everything checks out. I think I've got the correct answer here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern allows using a formula for the nth layer, leading to the final computation.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because this is a long process and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recompute Layer 1 to Layer 9 to ensure each step is correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240.

Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, finally, 3*29524: As above, we get 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, starting from L_1 = 4, then L_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 =4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me find C. Suppose L_n = C, then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 =4: 4 = A*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 =8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since our expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3^{10} directly and then plug into the formula. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So yes, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer, which might be faster, especially if the number of layers is larger. But since I only had 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. It's good to know that the formula works. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}\\) with \\(L_1 = 4\\), we find that each layer can be expressed as \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me just verify that I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, that's not quite right. Let me check: a_1 is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n. But in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 would be the value before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times ... ))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. Therefore, a_9 is the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then we multiply by 3. So, the problem reduces to computing a_9, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 4. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values to make sure. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.

For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. Then, the original expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer.

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3\u00d7previous layer. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3\u00d7L_1 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3\u00d7L_2 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3\u00d7L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3\u00d7L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A\u00d73^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3\u00d7C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A\u00d73^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A\u00d73^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_n = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier result. Therefore, the final computation is 3\u00d7L_9 =3\u00d729524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was unsure at first, stepping through each layer was a good way to confirm. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose I have n layers. Let me define a function f(n) where f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each layer is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). Let me compute f(1) to f(9) to see if it matches what I did before. f(1) = 4. f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121. f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364. f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. f(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. f(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. f(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Yes, that's the same as before. So, the outermost expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see. The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume f_p(n) = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Correct, as before. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*f(9)=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Wait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost.

So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a nested multiplication, which can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, multiplying the outermost 3 by 29,524 gives 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could represent this expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series, but let me see.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we found before.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've got it. The key was to recognize the pattern and either compute each layer step by step or find a formula to represent the layers. Both approaches led me to the same answer, so I'm pretty sure that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the result efficiently. \n\nThe final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, carry over 1, 9 + 9 + 1 = 19, carry over 1, 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. So that's 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. 0 + 5 = 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1. 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. So the result is 88572. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for such expressions, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. If there were more layers, maybe I'd look for a pattern or a formula, but for nine layers, step-by-step computation works fine. Another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can compute each a_n up to n=9, then multiply by 3. Let's verify that approach: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any calculation errors because I double-checked each step, and the numbers seem to follow the pattern correctly. It's easy to make a multiplication mistake when dealing with larger numbers, but breaking it down digit by digit and adding step by step helps prevent errors. So, overall, the problem involves recognizing the nested structure, computing each layer from the inside out, and then performing the final multiplication. It's a good exercise in careful step-by-step computation and attention to detail to avoid mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if that approach would work. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a closed-form expression, which might help in computing the value without having to compute each layer step by step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is:\n\na_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form solution from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.

Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the result should be 88572, which is a 5-digit number as well. Wait, let me write it correctly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n29524\n\n*         3\n\n------------\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, no, actually, when you write the multiplication, you start from the units digit. So, 4*3=12, so units digit is 2, carryover 1. Next, tens digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next, hundreds digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Thousands digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Ten-thousands digit: 2*3=6 +2=8.

The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. In this case, n=9 layers inside the outermost 3. Let me think about how this grows. Let's denote each layer as L_k, where k is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for L_n in terms of n. Let's see if we can find a pattern or a recursive formula. Each L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Let's assume L_k = A*3^k + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nL_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^k + 3B.\n\nSo, L_k = A*3^k + (1 + 3B).\n\nComparing with our assumed form L_k = A*3^k + B, we have:\n\nB = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. For k=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nk=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nk=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've done this correctly, but just to be thorough, let me recompute the layers one more time to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYep, that all checks out. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find each layer's value and substitute it into the next. The final result is 3 times the value of the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the ninth layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check that again. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. Hmm, but wait, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. But let me double-check my calculations for each layer because that seems like a very large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back and verify each layer. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer is correct. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check 29524 * 3 again to be thorough. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000. 9000 * 3 = 27000. 500 * 3 = 1500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, the problem is written as 3(1+3(...)) so I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a layer. Let's count them: Starting from the first opening parenthesis after the first 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each time we have a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the total number of layers is 9, right? Because from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. So, yes, Layer 1 to Layer 9, as I did before. Therefore, my calculation seems correct, leading to 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step, writing down each value.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute the entire expression using another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, we can express a_n in terms of a_{n-1}. So, for each layer, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given that a_1 = 4, and the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's plug in n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula, a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, plug A = 3/2 into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThus, using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each layer was 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, I could express each layer in terms of a formula, which saved time instead of computing each layer step by step. However, since the number of layers wasn't too large, computing each step manually was manageable, and it's a good way to verify the formula's result.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is effectively a geometric series. The expression a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be seen as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3. But since it's finite (nine layers), it's a finite geometric series. However, in this case, since each term is added rather than multiplied, it's a bit different, but the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nI think I've covered all bases here. I computed each layer step by step, checked my work, derived a formula to confirm the result, and even considered alternative approaches to ensure the answer is correct. So, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using a closed-form formula derived from this recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost layer and multiply by 3 for the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, putting it together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in any step. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to see if there's a quicker way instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1 here. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^n * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but actually, the standard solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, let me recall. For a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. In our case, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in the problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. So, maybe L_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer is L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1} for k from 2 to 9. So, if we have L_1 = 4, then L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as we computed before. So, in this case, the general solution would be L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). But wait, our initial condition is L_1 = 4. So, perhaps we can adjust the formula accordingly. Let me see. Let me define n as the number of layers. So, if Layer 1 is the innermost, then Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, n=9 layers. Let me see if I can express L_n in terms of L_1. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as starting from L_0, but in our problem, the innermost layer is L_1. Let me try to write down the recurrence:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3*L_0, but in our case, L_1 is 1 + 3, so L_0 must be 1. Wait, that might not be correct. Wait, no. Let me think again. If we consider the innermost layer as L_1, then L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. So, in this case, the recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1} for k from 2 to 9, with L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, in general, for such a recurrence, the solution is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where a=3, b=1, and C is determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. For a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*a^n, and the particular solution is L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a). So, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + b/(1 - a). Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*a^1 + b/(1 - a) = C*3 + 1/(1 - 3) = 3C + 1/(-2) = 3C - 1/2. We know L_1 = 4, so 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we get the same result without computing each layer manually. That's reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.

Let me confirm: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add them: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, +9000 = 88048, +500 = 88548, +24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, earlier when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, is that correct? Let me check each layer computation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 + 120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplifying the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1=4. Plugging n=1 into the general solution: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*( (3^{10})/2 -1/2 )= (3^{11})/2 - 3/2. Wait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147)/2 - 3/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. Just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a few layers manually again to confirm. Let's do that quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. I don't see any errors in my computations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is definitely more than 80,000. Wait, no, 29,524 * 3: Let me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then subtract 476 * 3 because 30,000 - 476 = 29,524. So, 476 * 3 = 1,428. Therefore, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me consider that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric progression. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series perhaps? Let me see. If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 +3=4. a_2=1 +3a_1=1 +12=13. a_3=1 +3a_2=1 +39=40. It seems like each a_n = 1 +3a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3A +1 => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). But wait, in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(a_9). Because the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9). So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and used the formula instead of computing each layer step by step. But either way, I arrive at the same answer. So, I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a geometric series pattern.

Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this multiplication. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n24 * 3 = 72, so write 2, carry 7.\n\n52 * 3 = 156 + 7 = 163, write 3, carry 16.\n\n29 * 3 = 87 + 16 = 103, write 3, carry 10.\n\nWait, but this approach is confusing. Maybe a better way is to compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. But since it's 29,524, it's 30,000 - 476. So, 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 88,572 as well. So that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the innermost parentheses was 4, then each layer built upon that. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 93*3=279. So, 3,000 + 279 = 3,279. Then 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: Let's break it down. 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, I multiply by 3 as the outermost operation. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can solve it. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost Layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer goes up to Layer 9. So, when n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same result without having to compute each layer manually. That's a good check.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me try to see if that approach works.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, I see a pattern here. Each a_n is the sum of a geometric series. Let's see:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n.\n\nWhich is a geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio 3, up to 3^n terms.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nHere, r=3, so S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWhich matches the formula I derived earlier. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize the geometric series, I end up with the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. I think I've got it right.\n\nAnother way to check is to consider the structure of the expression. Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression. So, each layer is effectively 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That's exactly the recurrence relation I used earlier.\n\nI think I've covered all possible ways to approach this problem, and all methods lead to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the computed value is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, then each time it's 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(...)\": Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that each \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n2. Then moving out, the next is (1 + 3( Layer 1 )), which is Layer 2.\n3. Then (1 + 3( Layer 2 )), Layer 3.\n4.

So when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, getting 88572, that seems correct. But just to make sure, let me compute each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, as I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 =88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression in terms of the formula.\n\nSince each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yes, same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer:88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression.

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading from top: 8 (from the 2*3+2), then 8 (from 9*3+1), then 5, then 7, then 2. So, 88572. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9000 = 88048. Then, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Okay, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and check each layer because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting again, let me compute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the addition for 3*29524 again just to be sure. 29524 * 3: Let me compute it digit by digit without carrying over first. 29524: digits are 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nMultiply each by 3:\n\n4*3=12\n2*3=6\n5*3=15\n9*3=27\n2*3=6\n\nNow, writing these results from right to left:\n\n12 (units place), 6, 15, 27, 6.\n\nNow, let's add the carries:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n12: write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 6 + 1 (carry) =7.\n\nNext digit: 15: write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 27 +1 (carry) =28: write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 6 +2 (carry) =8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me also check with another method: 29524 * 3.\n\nI can break down 29524 as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression from the inside out again, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, and a_{n} =1 +3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the equation: K =1 +3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula also gives the same result. Therefore, I can be absolutely sure that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\), repeated nine times, with the entire expression multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\), which is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 units place is 2, carryover 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens place is 7, carryover 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place is 5, carryover 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands place is 8, carryover 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten-thousands place is 8\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units).

So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check my earlier layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation where each term is a function of the previous term. Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) for n > 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is:\n\nL(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 \u2192 -2*A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3*C - 1/2 \u2192 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\nL(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9 for the outermost layer. Wait, actually, let me check: the innermost layer is L(1) = 4, and each subsequent layer adds one more. So, the outermost layer is L(9). Therefore, L(9) = (3^(9+1) - 1)/2 = (3^10 - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as 3*L(9), where L(9) is as above, so 3*(3^10 - 1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 59049 * 3 = 177147\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2192 Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form expression, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable, but it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic, so having a formula is nice to verify.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the closed-form solution. Let me re-derive it quickly.\n\nGiven the recurrence L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we assume L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1 \u2192 -2*A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2\n\nSo, general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nApplying initial condition at n=1:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 0.5 \u2192 3C = 4.5 \u2192 C = 1.5 = 3/2\n\nThus, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nYes, that's correct. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with both methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but I'm not sure if that applies here directly since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1 in a nested way. But the recurrence approach seems to work well.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, each time you're adding 1 and tripling the result. So, it's a kind of exponential growth.\n\nBut regardless of the approach, whether step-by-step computation or using the closed-form formula, the result is the same.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've verified it sufficiently. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

So the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back and verify each layer's computation to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, if I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...), I think there are 9 layers. Let me count the parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each layer is 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...): 1. 3(1+3(...) 2. 3(1+3(...) 3. 3(...) and so on. Let me count them: Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3(Layer1), Layer3:1+3(Layer2), etc., up to Layer9. So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, my computation of 9 layers is correct. So, I think my final answer is correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. The final result after computing all layers and multiplying by 3 is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I did the previous step-by-step, I thought 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer. But wait, let me think again: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are nine layers because I count nine opening parentheses after the first 3. Wait, no, actually, when I look at the original expression, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs. From the innermost, each time, so how many layers are there? Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that, so the number of layers is equal to the number of 1+3(1+3(1+...)) segments. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the opening parentheses after the initial 3: Each 1+3( starts a new layer. So, starting from the first ( after 3, that's the first layer, then each subsequent ( is another layer. Let me count them: 1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3))))) \n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers of 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(Layer n). So, in my earlier computation, I went up to Layer 9, which is correct. So, the computation seems accurate. Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. This looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have a nested expression with n layers, each layer being 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let's denote the value of the nth layer as a_n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the problem reduces to finding a_9, then multiplying by 3. Now, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer without having to compute each layer individually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. It's always good to recognize patterns and see if a general formula can be applied to save time and reduce the chance of arithmetic errors. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. \n\nAfter computing each layer up to the ninth layer, we find that the ninth layer equals 29,524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's verify each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall: The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, whose solution is L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition to find C: At n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, as both the step-by-step computation and the general formula lead to the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 2 is 8. So, putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So 88572? Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\n- Units place: 4\n- Tens place: 2\n- Hundreds place: 5\n- Thousands place: 9\n- Ten-thousands place: 2\n\nSo, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds:5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 *3. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nCompute 29524 + 29524 first:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n- 4 + 4 = 8\n- 2 + 2 = 4\n- 5 + 5 = 10, carryover 1\n- 9 + 9 = 18 +1=19, carryover 1\n- 2 + 2 = 4 +1=5\n\nSo, 29524 +29524=59048.\n\nNow add another 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n- 8 +4=12, write 2, carryover1\n- 4 +2=6 +1=7\n- 0 +5=5\n- 9 +9=18, write 8, carryover1\n- 5 +2=7 +1=8\n- 0 + carryover1=1\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.

So, yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me double-check the layers because maybe I made a mistake in computing one of them.\n\nLet me go through each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.

Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me try computing the expression step by step without labeling the layers, just to see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 +3=4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 +3*(previous result)=1 +3*4=13.\n\nNext layer:1 +3*13=40.\n\nNext:1 +3*40=121.\n\nNext:1 +3*121=364.\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3:3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. So, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if that formula holds.\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but a_1=4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe the formula is different.\n\nAlternatively, solving the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K =1 +3*K => K=1 +3K => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it directly without computing each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since the problem had 9 layers, computing each step was manageable. However, it's good to know that there's a formula for such nested expressions. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous result). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the innermost value, then use it to compute the next layer, and so on, until reaching the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost Layer):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Calculation:**  \n    Multiply the result by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number. So, when I multiply by 3, the digits would be:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place: 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands place: 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps again because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer computation.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Each \"(\" corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3 is the innermost, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears before the first closing parenthesis. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of opening parentheses, which would indicate the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, and so on. Let me count the number of layers by the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time we have an opening parenthesis after a 3, that's a new layer. Let's count:\n\n- The first layer after the initial 3 is 1+3(...), so that's Layer 1.\n- Inside that, another 1+3(...) is Layer 2.\n- This continues until the ninth layer, I think.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- The first opening parenthesis after 3: Layer 1\n- Inside that, another opening parenthesis: Layer 2\n- Inside that, another: Layer 3\n- And so on, until we reach the ninth opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, but in the expression, how many opening parentheses are there after the initial 3? Let's see:\n\nAfter 3(, we have 1+3(, which is the first layer. Then inside that, another 1+3(, which is the second layer, and so on until the ninth layer, which is the innermost one. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is the last one. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the first \"1+3(\" after the initial 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" is the next layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. ... inside that: 3(1+3(\n3. ... inside that: 3(1+3(\n4. ... inside that: 3(1+3(\n5. ... inside that: 3(1+3(\n6. ... inside that: 3(1+3(\n7. ... inside that: 3(1+3(\n8. ... inside that: 3(1+3(\n9. ... inside that: 3(1+3)\n\nWait, so that's nine layers, each starting with \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. So, each layer is one more than the previous, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, as I computed earlier, each layer's value is:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I correctly accounted for all layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", each layer adds another \"(\". Let's count them:\n\n- After the initial 3, the first \"(\" starts Layer 1.\n- Then, inside that, another \"(\", starting Layer 2.\n- This continues until Layer 9, which is the innermost.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers in total. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no, actually, in the expression, the innermost is the last one. So, when you have multiple layers, the innermost is the deepest. So, perhaps I should have labeled the innermost as Layer 9, and worked my way outwards.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in labeling. Let me try again. Let me consider the innermost expression as Layer 1, then each layer wraps around that, so Layer 2, Layer 3, etc., up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and the computations seem consistent. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the result of the innermost expression into the next outer layer until the entire expression is simplified. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(inner expression)}\\). The outermost term is multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute from the innermost layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, that seems high, but considering each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it might make sense. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, no, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we arrive at the same result, which confirms that our step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I wasn't sure at first, stepping through each layer was a good approach to avoid mistakes.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute a couple more layers using the formula to see if it holds.\n\nFor example, a_1 should be (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, I can trust that a_9 is indeed 29524, and the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and both the step-by-step method and the formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This repeats nine times.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**: Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"
