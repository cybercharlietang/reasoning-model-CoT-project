    "text": " 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40 (correct) Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121 (correct) Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 (correct) Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 (correct) Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 (correct) Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 (correct) Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me try a different approach to see if I can get the same result. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if that's the case. Let me consider the innermost term: 1 + 3. That's 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 13, which is 1 + 3*4. The next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4). So, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, in general, each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's solve for A and B. We know that a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate, but since our series is finite, maybe we can solve it differently. Alternatively, let's compute the first few terms to see if we can find a pattern. a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\na_2 = 13 = 1 + 3*4\na_3 = 40 = 1 + 3*13\na_4 = 121 = 1 + 3*40\na_5 = 364 = 1 + 3*121\na_6 = 1093 = 1 + 3*364\na_7 = 3280 = 1 + 3*1093\na_8 = 9841 = 1 + 3*3280\na_9 = 29524 = 1 + 3*9841\n\nSo, each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 *3=60000\n\n9000 *3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as each layer being a term in a geometric sequence. Since each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But since the problem is finite, with 9 layers, the closed-form approach I used earlier is more straightforward. Either way, both methods lead to the same result, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, here's the step-by-step computation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result)\n3. Compute each layer up to the 9th layer:\n   - Layer 1: 4\n   - Layer 2: 13\n   - Layer 3: 40\n   - Layer 4: 121\n   - Layer 5: 364\n   - Layer 6: 1093\n   - Layer 7: 3280\n   - Layer 8: 9841\n   - Layer 9: 29524\n4. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 29524 *3 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous result). After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final answer is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This seems similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's a first-order linear recurrence, so it can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me find D. As n approaches infinity, the term C*3^n will dominate unless C=0. But since we have a finite number of layers (n=9), maybe we can find a pattern without solving the recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the first few terms and see if we can spot a pattern.\n\nWe have:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can notice that each a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found as a constant. Let's assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, since the final expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nSame result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88,572 is correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me just verify one more time by computing a few layers using the formula to ensure consistency.\n\nFor example, a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nSimilarly, a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nSo, everything checks out. Therefore, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), we compute \\( a_9 \\) and then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each layer using \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\):\n   - \\( a_1 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( a_2 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( a_3 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( a_4 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( a_5 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( a_6 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( a_7 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( a_8 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( a_9 = 29524 \\)\n\n2.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so it's a geometric progression with ratio 3, but since each term is 1 + 3*previous, it's a bit different.

Is that 29523? Yes, because 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, the final computation is correct: 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression step by step, writing each layer as I go:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each layer manually. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWe can solve for A and B.\n\nGiven L_1 = 4, and the recurrence L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that the step-by-step computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

Let me add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.

Hmm, but I feel like maybe I missed a layer. Let me count the number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them: Starting from the innermost, each time we have (1 + 3(...)), so the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8). So, that's 9 layers. So, my computation is correct with 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such recursions. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but I need to check the exact form. Wait, actually, the standard form is a_n = k + r*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - r*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = A*r^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (k), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the equation: C = k + r*C => C - r*C = k => C*(1 - r) = k => C = k/(1 - r). Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + k/(1 - r). Applying initial conditions to find A. In our case, k=1, r=3. So, the particular solution is C = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, what's the initial condition? At n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. But in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3, so a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is building up a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, for each layer, you're effectively doing (1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, after n layers, the value is (3^{n} - 1)/2, but wait, that's similar to the formula I derived earlier. Wait, no, in my earlier formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. So, this gives the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step seems to follow logically, and both the iterative approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using the formula for the nth term of such a recurrence relation, which is a geometric series, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3 * 29524 is 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9000 = 88048. Then, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Okay, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each subsequent one adds another layer. Let me count: 1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until there are nine layers. Wait, actually, the expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my initial calculation was correct, computing up to Layer 9 and then multiplying by 3. So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, we determine the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward. The final result is computed as follows:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} to find each subsequent layer up to a_9.\n3.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's assume L_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, we have: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as I computed earlier. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since each Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's another way to get the same result. So, that confirms the answer again. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So yes, 88572. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check my calculations again because the numbers are getting quite large, and I might have made an error in the earlier layers.

But wait, that seems like a very large number, and I'm not sure if I did the multiplication correctly. Let me try multiplying 29524 by 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n3 * 3 = 9, write down 9.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 9, 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the digits should be written from the last multiplication to the first. Let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4*3=12 \u2192 units digit is 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit (tens place): 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens digit is 7, carryover 0.\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5*3=15 \u2192 hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\nNext digit (thousands place): 9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands digit is 8, carryover 2.\nNext digit (ten-thousands place): 2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten-thousands digit is 8, carryover 0.\nNext digit (hundred-thousands place): 3*3=9 \u2192 hundred-thousands digit is 9.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 9 (hundred-thousands), 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572. Wait, that's what I got before. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me check if there's a pattern here because each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, Layer n = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nTo find A and B, let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, let's find the next term using the recurrence. For n=2, a_2=3*a_1 +1=3*4 +1=13.\n\nUsing the general solution for n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B =13.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n1) 3A + B =4\n2)9A + B =13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) =13 -4 =>6A=9 =>A=9/6=3/2.\n\nNow, substituting A=3/2 into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B=4 =>9/2 + B=4 =>B=4 -9/2= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with the earlier layers to make sure.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, as Layer 1 is 4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is (3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. This forms a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Each layer can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **General Solution**: The closed-form solution for the nth layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer**: For n=9 (the outermost layer), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but wait, I'm getting 88572, but I remember sometimes when you have repeated layers, there's a formula for it. Maybe it's a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. Given a_1=4, and a_n=1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K -3K=1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K=-1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C -1/2 \u2192 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2192 correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2192 correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since the problem has 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572 \u2192 same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in the computations, and the formula confirms the result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a formula for a geometric series.

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer computation. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364, correct.

Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. Hmm, so that seems to add up. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which would save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. For n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: Multiply each digit by 3 starting from the right. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572.

So the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps because sometimes when I compute layers, I might have made a mistake.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about whether this sequence follows a geometric progression or something similar.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nHmm, each layer seems to be 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, each term can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nGiven a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check this formula with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula up to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3, we find the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)} \\).\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation:** Each layer \\( a_n \\) can be defined as \\( a_n = 3 \\times a_{n-1} + 1 \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence:** The general solution for this recurrence is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Compute the Ninth Layer:** For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should just multiply 29524 by 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when I multiply by 3, I should have a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me check: 29524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next digit: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. But wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so after the 2, there's no more digits, so the carryover 2 would go to a new digit. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I got Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check my layer computations because that seems like a lot. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I'm wondering if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. That seems like a linear recurrence. Let me try to find a general formula for Layer n. The recurrence is: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Layer n^(h) = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Layer n^(p) = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Since we have Layer 9, let's compute Layer 9 using the formula: Layer 9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. By working from the inside out, I computed each layer step by step, confirming each result as I went. Then, I noticed a pattern and derived a general formula for the nth layer, which allowed me to compute Layer 9 directly without manually computing each previous layer. Finally, I multiplied Layer 9 by 3 to get the final result. I believe this is correct, and I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer (Layer 9) is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 29524 * 3 = 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that seems more accurate.\n\nWait, 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 would be 88572.

It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.

Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C first. If a_n = C, then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could also think about the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I expand it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Expanding this would give me 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) but that seems more complicated. Maybe using the recurrence relation was a better approach. Either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula from the recurrence, I end up with the same result. So, I think I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term).

Maybe I should just multiply 29524 by 3 directly:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carryover 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carryover 2.\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nWait, no, actually, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carryover 0.\n\nWait, that seems better. So putting it together: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8? Wait, no, let's do it step by step:\n\nUnits place: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\nTens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\nHundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\nThousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\nTen-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo writing it all together, from ten-thousands to units: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So 88572? Wait, that can't be right because 3 * 29524 should be more than 80,000. Wait, 29524 is almost 30,000, so 3*30,000 is 90,000, so the result should be around 88,572. Let me check with another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. So the final answer is 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that looks correct. Each layer is computed correctly by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so maybe it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1, a1=4; n=2, a2=13; n=3, a3=40; and so on, up to a9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a9. So, perhaps there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, rewrite the recurrence as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the outermost layer, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So yes, 88572 is correct. Wait, but earlier I thought Layer 9 was 29524, but when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me go back and check each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The first is 3*(...). Then inside that, it's 1 +3*(...), which is Layer 2. Then inside that, 1 +3*(...), which is Layer 3, and so on until the innermost is Layer 9. So yes, 9 layers in total. So my computation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, especially since this could get tedious with more layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 +3=4. So, L_2=1+3*4=13, L_3=1+3*13=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n -3*L_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4. So, when n=1, L_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 3A -1/2=4 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 5 * 3 = 15, plus 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should write it out properly:\n\n      29524\n    x     3\n    --------\n      88572\n\nLet me verify each digit:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, plus 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But I'm not entirely sure if I computed each layer correctly. Let me go back and check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, if the nested expression evaluates to 29524, then 3 times that is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check 3^{10} to be sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Alternatively, to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication, let me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find the value of each layer. The innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using the recurrence relation, we find that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that matches the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see: Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if we expand it, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If we expand this, it's similar to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to some terms, but actually, since each term is nested, it's more like a geometric series multiplied by 3 each time. But perhaps the formula I used earlier is more straightforward. Either way, both methods lead to the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using the recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer is (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me check Layer 8 again: Layer 8 is 1 + 3*Layer 7. Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. That's correct. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct. Then, 3*29524: As before, that's 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1:1+3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Now, equate coefficients: C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D + 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4: a_1 = C*3^1 + D = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, the expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get 88572 as the final answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I wrote 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093, which is correct. But when I got to Layer 7, I wrote 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So that seems correct. Wait, but let me check Layer 7 again. 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 93*3=279; so 3,000 + 279 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840; so 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9,841: Let's compute that. 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. So, all the layers compute correctly. Therefore, the final answer after multiplying by 3 is indeed 88,572. So, I think I did that correctly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's count: Each time we have 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested. The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on. So, how many layers? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of times we have 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost, which is the first 1+3, then each layer is another 1+3(...). So, how many layers? Let's see: The expression is 3*(...), and inside, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), etc. So, if I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, it's nine. So, there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct, and then multiplied by 3. So, my computation should be correct. But let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, but let me check Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Then Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the recursive relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve the recurrence relation directly.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have a_9, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me write it out vertically:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x         3\n   ------------\n     8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, let's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but when I multiplied by 3, I got 88572. But let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I was computing Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but when I multiply that by 3, I get 88572. But let me check if I'm correctly interpreting the original problem. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, my approach was correct: compute each layer from the inside out, then multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\nWait, but another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each layer manually. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is defined recursively. Then, the expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, leading to a geometric progression. But since I already solved it step by step and confirmed it with the formula, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the expression step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal result: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. I don't see any errors in the calculations now. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost and then multiplying the final result by 3, we arrive at the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer), with nine layers in total. The entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3**:\n   - Final Result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 29524 * 3: Multiply each digit by 3, starting from the right. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me verify: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9. Is there a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for such a sequence? Let's see. The recursive relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=1: L1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13. Correct. Similarly, for n=9: L9 = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using exponents directly without computing each layer. Since each layer is Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then L9 = (3^10 -1)/2, as I did. Then, 3*L9 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, 3*L9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using exponents, which might be faster and less error-prone. But since the problem specifically asks to compute the given expression, and it's a finite number of layers, either method works. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Alternatively, I can recognize that this expression is a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a geometric progression.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution.

Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth layer.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of layer n, where n ranges from 1 to 9.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 13\n\nL_3 = 40\n\nL_4 = 121\n\nL_5 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 29524\n\nI notice that each L_n is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n, but considering the time, perhaps it's easier to stick with the step-by-step computation since there are only 9 layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see how each layer grows. Let's see:\n\nFrom L_1 to L_2: 4 to 13, which is an increase of 9.\n\nFrom L_2 to L_3: 13 to 40, which is an increase of 27.\n\nFrom L_3 to L_4: 40 to 121, which is an increase of 81.\n\nWait a minute, 9, 27, 81... These are powers of 3: 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81.\n\nSimilarly, from L_4 to L_5: 121 to 364, which is an increase of 243, which is 3^5.\n\nFrom L_5 to L_6: 364 to 1093, which is 729, which is 3^6.\n\nFrom L_6 to L_7: 1093 to 3280, which is 2187, which is 3^7.\n\nFrom L_7 to L_8: 3280 to 9841, which is 6561, which is 3^8.\n\nFrom L_8 to L_9: 9841 to 29524, which is 19683, which is 3^9.\n\nSo, the difference between each layer is 3^(n+1), where n starts at 2. Wait, let me check:\n\nBetween L_1 and L_2: 13 - 4 = 9 = 3^2\n\nBetween L_2 and L_3: 40 - 13 = 27 = 3^3\n\nBetween L_3 and L_4: 121 - 40 = 81 = 3^4\n\nYes, so each time, the difference is 3 raised to the power of (current layer number + 1). Hmm, interesting. So, if I wanted to compute L_n, I could express it as a sum of these differences plus the initial term.\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, since each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and starting from L_1 = 4, I can write L_n as a sum involving powers of 3.\n\nIn fact, this recurrence relation is a geometric series. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p\n\nSolving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 where n=9.\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*((3^{10} -1)/2).\n\nSo, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked each layer step by step, derived a formula for the nth layer, and confirmed that the final result is consistent both by direct computation and by using the formula. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers. So starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is 1+3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1), and so on until Layer9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, that's correct. I think my calculation is right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer1 = 4, Layer2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote L1 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, ..., L9 = 1 + 3*L8. Then, the total expression is 3*L9. Is there a closed-form formula for such a recurrence relation? Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a non-homogeneous linear recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, in our case, the first term is L1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got when I computed it step by step. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the final expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I end up with 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 29524 * 3: Multiply each digit by 3 and carry over as needed. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 3 * 3 = 9, write down 9. So, putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 3*3=9, write 9. So yes, it's 88572. Hmm, but wait, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. So, is that the final answer? Let me verify my computations step by step again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a formula for a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 => A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 => A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Simplifying, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, right? Because we have nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is correct. To double-check, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to ensure it's consistent. For example, Layer 5: n=5, L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Which is what I had before. Correct. Layer 7: n=7, L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. Layer 9: 29524 as before. So, everything checks out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer using the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This leads to a closed-form formula for each layer, which simplifies the computation. The final result after computing all layers and multiplying by 3 is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yeah, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me verify my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.

But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9. So yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nLooking at the recursion: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can solve it.\n\nFirst, write the recurrence:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to ensure that I didn't make a mistake in the exponent, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Let me confirm:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nAlright, so I think that's correct. But let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, and we have 9 layers, maybe I can represent this as a geometric series.\n\nWait, let's see. If I write L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and we have L_9, then expanding it, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, it's a sum of 1's multiplied by powers of 3.\n\nSpecifically, L_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} ?\n\nWait, no, because each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but it's nested, so it's not exactly a simple geometric series. But perhaps using the formula for a geometric series would help here.\n\nWait, from the recurrence relation, we found that L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nIf I denote S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) then S is similar to the layers we computed earlier.\n\nBut in this case, S = L_9, which is 29524.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine layers.\n\nBut since we've already computed it step by step and using the recurrence relation, and both methods gave the same result, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n\n3. Alternatively, model the layers using a recurrence relation and solve it to find a closed-form formula, which confirmed the value of Layer 9.\n\n4. Multiply Layer 9 by 3 to get the final result.\n\n5. Verify each step to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the computed result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can compute the value step by step.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is nested nine times, each layer being of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).\n\n2. **Define Layers:**\n   Let \\( L_n \\) denote the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost layer as \\( L_1 \\).\n\n3. **Recurrence Relation:**\n   Each layer follows the relation:\n   \\[\n   L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with the base case \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Solve the Recurrence:**\n   The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved to find a closed-form formula:\n   \\[\n   L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n   For \\( n = 9 \\):\n   \\[\n   L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.

Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula from the start. Since the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572. Hmm, but let me verify using another approach. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3 as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3.\n\n30000 \u00d7 3 = 90000.\n\n476 \u00d7 3 = 1428.\n\nSo, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the multiplication by 3 at the end gives the final result.

Wait, I think I messed up the place values here. Let me write it out more carefully:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nNow, the next digit is 9 (from 29524, which is 2 9 5 2 4). Wait, no, 29524 is 2 digits? No, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 (tens) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5 (hundreds) * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 (thousands) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 (ten thousands) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572? Let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer would be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about that.\n\nSuppose I define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3a_9.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have a_9, let's compute that:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Good.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this without defining each layer, by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to 3*(previous term) + 1. So, starting from 1, each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to think of it as each layer is (3^{n} - 1)/2, but I think I already did that with the recurrence.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead to the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\), leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 *3 = 88572. Correct. So, all my steps seem to check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer and then using that result in the next layer.

So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when you carry over, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, to verify, I can add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 \u2192 Layer 1\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3) \u2192 Layer 2\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3(1+3)) \u2192 Layer 3\n\nContinuing this way, each time adding another layer until Layer 9, which is the outermost. So yes, 9 layers in total. So my computation up to Layer 9 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost nine layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer's value by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:** Substitute Layer 1 into the next expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:** Substitute Layer 2 into the next expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:** Substitute Layer 3 into the next expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:** Substitute Layer 4 into the next expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:** Substitute Layer 5 into the next expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:** Substitute Layer 6 into the next expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:** Substitute Layer 7 into the next expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:** Substitute Layer 8 into the next expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"
