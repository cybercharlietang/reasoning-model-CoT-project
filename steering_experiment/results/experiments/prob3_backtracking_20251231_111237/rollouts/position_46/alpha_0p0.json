So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to double-check, let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should just do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 3*3=9, write 9. Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here because 29524 is a 5-digit number, right? Let me write it down properly:\n\n   2 9 5 2 4\n*        3\n----------\nLet me compute digit by digit from right to left:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, we have a carry over of 2? Wait, no, because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so after the first digit (units place), the next is tens, then hundreds, thousands, ten thousands. Wait, maybe I should think of it as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524.\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all my steps because I don't want to make a mistake. So starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So I think I've solved it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Each layer builds on the previous one, and by the time I reach the outermost layer, I just multiply by 3 to get the final result. It took a bit of time, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but it's always good to verify each step, especially when dealing with multiple layers of operations. So, yeah, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). To solve this, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Use the result from Layer 1 to compute Layer 2:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n4. Finally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. The original expression has nine layers, right? Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any. The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, Layer 3:1 + 3*13=40, Layer 4:1 + 3*40=121, Layer 5:1 + 3*121=364, Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1093, Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=3280, Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=9841, Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=29524. So that's correct, nine layers. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me recompute a few layers to verify. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, step-by-step seems manageable. Another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. The solution to this can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C = 4.5 => C=1.5 or 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2 = (59049)/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. The final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are growing so quickly. Let me check a few more layers to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's check Layer 5 again: Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. So, all layers up to 9 are correct. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression has nine layers, but when I started, I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) + 1. So, after Layer 9, we have 29524, and then we multiply by 3 to get the final result. So, yes, 88,572 seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose I have n layers, each of the form a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(4) = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_k^h = C*3^k. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_k^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for k = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is 29,524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, I think I did it correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Suppose we define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by adding 1 and three times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result.

So 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, which is correct, right? Let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, and each step adds up correctly. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nI recall that expressions like this, where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), can sometimes be expressed as a geometric series or using a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it that way.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolve for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolve for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The general solution was a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final computation is 3*29524=88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly for the outermost layer. The original expression is 3*a_9, where a_9=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nJust to make absolutely sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually using the formula. Let's take n=4: a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier computation. So, yes, the formula is reliable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer up to the ninth layer, which results in 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a general formula for Ln. Let's see. Let me write the recursive relation: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the coefficients are constant, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1. So, the homogeneous part is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. Let's see: L1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the innermost one in our original problem, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So when I multiply each digit:\n\nStarting from units:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\nTens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\nHundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\nThousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\nTen thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\n\nSo writing the result from the last carry to the first digit: 8 8 7 5 2? Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply 29524 by 3, it's more than 80,000. Let me check with a calculator approach.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000.\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500.\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60.\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought I got 88752? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me do it again more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nSo the result is 88572, which matches the earlier calculation. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because I think I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer builds upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like a geometric series, but each term is built recursively. Alternatively, this could be represented as a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. If I were to generalize this, maybe I could find a formula for a_n, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, noticing the pattern, each layer seems to be following a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches Layer 2. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is Layer 3. So this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, it would be (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 =88572, as previously calculated. So, using the formula, I can confirm that the result is indeed 88572 without computing each layer step by step. But since the problem was given with nine layers, it's good that both methods lead to the same answer. I think I've got it. The key was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or finding a general formula for the nth layer. Since the number of layers isn't too large, both approaches are manageable, but the formula is more efficient for larger numbers of layers.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I thought it was 29,524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.

After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4.

So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back through the layers step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to find a pattern. a_1 = 4 = (3^1) + 1? Wait, 3^1 = 3, plus 1 is 4. Yes. a_2 = 13. 3^2 = 9, plus 4 is 13. a_3 = 40. 3^3 = 27, plus 13 is 40. Wait, but 3^3 = 27, and a_3 = 40, which is 3^3 + a_2. Hmm, so perhaps a_n = 3^n + a_{n-1}. But that might not help directly. Alternatively, the solution to the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found as follows. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer.

Wait, but 29524 *3: Let me compute it another way. 29524 *3 is equal to (29000 + 524)*3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers because I think I might have miscounted how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the innermost, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the first layer is 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, then 1+3*40=121, then 1+3*121=364, then 1+3*364=1093, then 1+3*1093=3280, then 1+3*3280=9841, then 1+3*9841=29524. So that's 9 layers. So, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify each step again to be sure. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems consistent. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer outward until we reach the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each time, I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Is there a pattern here? Maybe a geometric series or something. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. This looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer I got earlier. Therefore, the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting with 1 + 3 at the innermost layer. By computing each subsequent layer, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, we find the value of the innermost expression to be 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but that's 8 digits? Let me check: 29524 is a 5-digit number. So when I multiply by 3, it's 29524*3: Let me compute it as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Alternatively, 29524*3: 4*3=12, 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, 7, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7.

Let me check with a calculator method: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, how many layers do we have? Let's see: The original expression is 3*(a_9), since there are nine layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That matches my previous result. So, using the formula, I also get 88572. That's reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested recurrence relation where each layer is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).

Wait, that's 88,572. Let me verify this with another method. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 *3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier when computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572. So yes, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, up to the 9th layer.\n\nYes, because each time it's 1 + 3*(...), and there are 9 such layers. So the computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually is feasible.\n\nWait, another approach: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then the total is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did before. So I think I can confidently say the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check one of the layers again to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error. For example, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, plus 3*1=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363=364. That's correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that all adds up.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572, correct. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer individually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let's denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is defined recursively. If I can find a closed-form expression for a_n, that might save time. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for a_n.\n\nWe have a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term minus 2. Let me check:\n\na_2 = 3*a_1 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10, but a_2 is 13, so that's not correct.\n\nWait, maybe it's 3 times the previous term plus 1? Let's see:\n\na_2 = 3*4 + 1 = 13, which is correct.\n\na_3 = 3*13 + 1 = 40, correct.\n\na_4 = 3*40 + 1 = 121, correct.\n\nYes, so the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2\n\nBut since we're dealing with integer solutions here, maybe this approach isn't the best. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a pattern or formula for a_n.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the recurrence as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can compute a few terms to see if a pattern emerges:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\n\na_3 = 3*13 + 1 = 40\n\na_4 = 3*40 + 1 = 121\n\na_5 = 3*121 + 1 = 364\n\na_6 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093\n\na_7 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\n\na_8 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\n\na_9 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, matches a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nYes, so the formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*(29524)=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this makes sense. I could have used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer, which would have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since there were only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. It's also a good way to verify the result by both methods.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and recognize the recurrence relation.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation.\n\n4. Use the formula to compute the desired term directly.\n\n5. Multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in recognizing patterns and applying recurrence relations to simplify computation.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer can be represented by the formula (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. Applying this formula up to the ninth layer gives us 29524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, starting from the innermost. Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8.

So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.

So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me check once more to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. It's easy to make a mistake when dealing with large numbers.\n\nLet me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This kind of recursive pattern might have a formula, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. If I let S be the innermost term, then each layer is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, starting from S_1 = 1 + 3. So, S_1 = 4, S_2 = 13, etc., as I computed before. This recurrence relation can be solved as S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nAssume S_n = C is a constant solution. Then, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but our layers are integers, so maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution is S_n = A*3^{n}.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming S_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2, as before.\n\nSo, the general solution is S_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition S_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = 3/2.\n\nThus, S_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that we have 9 layers, n goes from 1 to 9. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, actually, in our case, each layer is built upon the previous one. So, for Layer 1, n=1: S_1 = 4 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSimilarly, S_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, Layer 9 would be S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, S_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. Each step checks out, and the formula approach aligns with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a formula, we determine that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add them: 59048 + 29524: 8+4=12, 4+2=6, 0+5=5, 9+9=18, 5+2=7. Wait, that might not be the right way. Alternatively, 59048 + 29524: Let's add digit by digit from the right:\n\n  59048\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n4 + 2 = 6 +1=7, write 7.\n0 + 5 =5, write 5.\n9 +9=18, write 8, carryover 1.\n5 +2=7 +1=8, write 8.\nSo the sum is 88572.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify that multiplication another way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so total 1500+72=1572. Then, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I correctly identified the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times ...))). So, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, the layers are correct. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first parenthesis is after 3(1+3(...). Each subsequent layer adds another set. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each '1+3(' adds another layer. Let's count the number of '1+3(' segments. Starting from the first one after the initial 3, each layer is 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count: 1. 1+3(...) 2. 1+3(...) 3. 1+3(...) 4. 1+3(...) 5. 1+3(...) 6. 1+3(...) 7. 1+3(...) 8. 1+3(...) 9. 1+3(...))))) So, actually, there are nine layers inside the initial 3(...). Therefore, I correctly computed up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, but let me check if that's correct by computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's say I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). How would that compute? Let's compute it step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, the entire expression is 3*40 = 120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. That's correct. So, my method works for a smaller version. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem, which has nine layers, should be correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost expression, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each subsequent layer until the outermost expression is reached. Finally, the entire result is multiplied by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. This is similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a function of the previous term. Let's define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. Using the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4.\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since the original expression is 3*a_9, let's compute a_9 first.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost, which is the first 1+3, up to the ninth layer. So, using the formula, a_9 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, which would correspond to a_9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, the expression can be thought of as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf we expand this, it's similar to 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). But that might not be the easiest way.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, except for the initial 1.\n\nWait, but in the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer, so it's a linear recurrence, which we've already solved.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nIn any case, both methods gave me the same result: 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3.

Let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently, but since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), computing each layer step by step seems feasible and less error-prone. If I were to generalize this, it looks like each layer follows the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence might give a formula, but since the number of terms is small, computing each term is straightforward. However, for practice, let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for layer n=9, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the nth layer. Applying this formula for the 9th layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, which is then multiplied by 3. This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this. Let's define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: L1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n=9, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing this as a geometric series from the start. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*next layer. So, if I let E be the entire expression, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to nine layers. Wait, but actually, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*Layer8, and so on. So, perhaps if I model this as a sum, but it's not a straightforward geometric series because each term is being multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, but with the formula we have, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, L9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then E=3*L9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer follows a pattern similar to a geometric series, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven L_1 = 4, let's solve for A and B.\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, L_1 = A*3 + B = 4.\n\nAlso, L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 13.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9\n\nA = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nThen, from equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, L_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, n=9.\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer, which is nice. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step and verify with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 29524 * 3: Multiply each digit by 3 starting from the right. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together, from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 7, 8, 2, 8, 6. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should write it out more carefully. Let me write it down step by step:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 (carry) = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nWait, but the number is 29524, which is five digits. So, when I multiply, I should have:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n- Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I got Layer 9 as 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So that should be the final answer.\n\nBut let me double-check my layer computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. So starting from the innermost, I did nine layers, ending up with 29524, then multiplied by 3. So yes, that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo using the recurrence relation method, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So it's like building a number in base 3 or something. But I think the recurrence relation approach was more straightforward.\n\nSo, to recap, I computed each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, and each time I got the next layer by computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). After nine layers, I had 29524, and then I multiplied that by 3 to get the final answer of 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1 repeatedly, it's exponential growth, so it makes sense. Let me verify each step to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: Multiply each digit by 3 starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, let me verify that. Alternatively, 29524 *3: 29524 +29524 +29524. Let's add them up: 29524 +29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 +29524: 59048 +20000=79048, 79048 +9000=88048, 88048 +524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+. Starting from the left: 1+3(...), then another 1+3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me see: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent 1+3(...) is a new layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3. Then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many times does 1+3 get wrapped? Let me count the number of closing parentheses. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there's 9 sets of (1+3(...)), each nested within the previous. So, that's 9 layers. Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was correct. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but I think I might have miscalculated Layer 9. Let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: As before, 29524*3=88572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the expression had 9 layers, but when I counted the opening parentheses, I think there are 9 sets. Let me confirm by counting the number of opening parentheses after each 1+. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+\" is followed by \"3(\" except the last one. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances. Let's see: Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first \"1+\" is followed by \"3(\", then another \"1+\" followed by \"3(\", and so on until the last one, which is \"1+3\". So, how many \"1+3(\" are there? Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3)\n\nSo, that's 9 instances where \"1+3(\" occurs, which means there are 9 layers. Therefore, my calculation up to Layer 9 is correct, and the final result is 88572. So, I think I did this correctly. I don't see any mistakes in the steps I took, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with a repeating pattern.

So, writing it all together: 7 7 8 5 2, but that's 77852? Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 *3 should be 88572, but my step-by-step is giving me 77852, which is conflicting. I think I messed up the digits. Let me write it down properly:\n\n       29524\n     x    3\n     -------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3 =12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7.\n\n5 *3=15, write 5, carryover1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write8, carryover2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write7, carryover1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, the result is 7 7 8 5 2, which is 77852.

So, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, so why did my previous step-by-step multiplication give me 77852? I think I messed up the digits. Let me try again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nNext:5*3=15, write5, carryover1.\n\nNext:9*3=27 +1=28, write8, carryover2.\n\nNext:5*3=15 +2=17, write7, carryover1.\n\nNext:2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it down: 7 (from the 2*3+1), then 7 (from 5*3+1), then 8 (from 9*3+1), then5, then2.

Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 was 3,280, so 3*3,280 is 9,840. Adding 1 gives 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. 3*9,841: Let's compute that again to be sure.\n\n9,841 \u00d7 3:\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000\n\n800 \u00d7 3 = 2,400 \u2192 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n40 \u00d7 3 = 120 \u2192 29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3 \u2192 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, the final computation is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original problem is 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, we multiply by 3 to get the final answer. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 = 3^2 + 1 + 3*1\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, which is 29,524.\n\nThen, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u2192 -2*a_p = 1 \u2192 a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^{10}=59,049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the formula applies correctly. The recurrence starts at n=1 with a_1=4. So, in the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=1, a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the formula is correct.\n\nThus, using the formula is a much faster way, especially if the number of layers is large. But since here we have 9 layers, computing each step manually is manageable, though time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to compute this without recognizing the pattern, I might have just proceeded step by step as I did initially, which is a bit tedious but straightforward.\n\nIn summary, the problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By working from the innermost layer outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, I was able to compute each layer's value step by step, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work to ensure accuracy. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a step-by-step approach, we find the solution as follows:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n2. Each layer follows the recurrence relation: \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n3. Compute up to the ninth layer, resulting in \\( a_9 = 29,524 \\).\n4. Multiply by 3 to get the final result: \\( 3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"
