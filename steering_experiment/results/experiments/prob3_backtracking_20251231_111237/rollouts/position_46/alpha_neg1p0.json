So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is 88572. Let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. So, yes, 88572. Wait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I had recognized the pattern earlier, I could have used the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which would have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine, computing each step wasn't too bad. So, in summary, by recognizing the nested structure and either computing each layer step by step or finding a general formula using recurrence relations, I arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be represented as a geometric sequence. Solving the recurrence gives us the value of the innermost expression, which is then used to compute the final result by multiplying with 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). This forms a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation**: Let \\( a_n \\) represent the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. The relation is \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The recurrence \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) has the general solution \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Compute the Innermost Layer**: For the innermost layer (n=9), \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer, so \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Let's write it out:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15.

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nThis expression is a geometric series, perhaps? Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this recursively. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that formula works perfectly. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each time, the value grows exponentially because each layer is multiplied by 3, leading to rapid growth. So, even though there are only nine layers, the numbers get big quickly.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, I'll recompute the final multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nLet's do it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, no, actually, when writing the multiplication, it's:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x        3\n   -----------\n     8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, let me write it properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x        3\n   -----------\n     8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the result should be 5 or 6 digits. 29524 * 3 = 88572, which is a 5-digit number, but let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and everything seems consistent. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(another term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nBecause n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing them. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So each layer seems to be correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. So, 3A + B = 4. Also, for the homogeneous solution, but since it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence, the particular solution can be found. Alternatively, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, the solution can be written as a_n = (a_1 + (1)/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - (1)/(3-1). Wait, that might be a formula I can use. The standard solution for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = (a_1 + d/(c-1)) * c^{n-1} - d/(c-1). In this case, c=3, d=1. So, a_n = (4 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1) = (4 + 1/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = (81/2) - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let's compute that. First, 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Then, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2. Let's compute (9/2)*6561: 9*6561 = 59049. Then, 59049/2 = 29524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_9=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me try computing one more layer manually. For example, let's compute Layer 7 again: Layer 6 is 1093. So, Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Then Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute 29524*3 another way: 29524*3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4)*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000+27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, all steps check out, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Compute the innermost parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Move to the next layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Continue with the next layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Proceeding outward:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Continue outward:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Final layer before multiplying by 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Multiply the result by 3:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, writing down each layer as I go. Let's try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we get the same result. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. I think that's solid now. So, to recap, by recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, we can compute the value without manually calculating each layer, which is especially useful if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step was manageable too. Another way to think about it is that each layer is essentially building up a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the total sum can be represented as a geometric series. But in this case, because of the structure of the expression, the recurrence approach worked well.

This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. Given Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Let me write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplify: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: L9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I can use this formula to find L9 directly. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*(3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that. First, compute 3^10: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 So, 3^10=59049. Then, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, we can represent this as 3*( (3^10 -1)/2 ). So, 3*( (59049 -1)/2 ) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524=88572. Either way, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving each layer step by step or using the derived formula, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3 step by step. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\nSo yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations for each layer because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3\u00d7(previous layer). This is a recursive relation. Let's denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. Then, Ln = 1 + 3\u00d7L(n-1), with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Ln = A\u00d73^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. We know that Ln = 1 + 3\u00d7L(n-1). Let's assume Ln = A\u00d73^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA\u00d73^n + B = 1 + 3\u00d7(A\u00d73^(n-1) + B)\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3\u00d7A\u00d73^(n-1) + 3\u00d7B = 1 + A\u00d73^n + 3B\n\nSo, A\u00d73^n + B = 1 + A\u00d73^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A\u00d73^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = A\u00d73^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9, L9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3\u00d7L9 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula. That might have saved some time instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, both methods are manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let's see. Each layer is 1 + 3\u00d7previous layer. If I expand the entire expression, maybe it's a sum of powers of 3. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d7Layer1 = 1 + 3\u00d7(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nWait, but that's not quite a geometric series. Let me see. Maybe if I expand the entire expression:\n\nThe original expression is 3\u00d7(1 + 3\u00d7(1 + 3\u00d7(1 + 3\u00d7(...)))) with nine layers.\n\nIf I let x = 1 + 3\u00d7(1 + 3\u00d7(...)) with eight layers, then the expression becomes 3\u00d7(1 + 3x). But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, considering that each layer adds another power of 3. From the earlier calculation, we saw that each layer is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. To make sure, let me verify the multiplication again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can determine the value of each layer. The innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as 1 plus three times the previous layer. This pattern continues until the ninth layer, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the next inner term.\n2. **Compute each layer**: Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1), compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous layer's value.\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so compute 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Wait, let me check that:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000 *3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdd them all together:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 *3=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^n*a_0 + c*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, r=3, c=1. Let me see if that formula applies here.\n\nWait, actually, the standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. In our case, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. So, yes, r=3, c=1.\n\nThe solution to this recurrence is a_n = (c/(r -1))*(r^{n} -1) + a_0*r^{n}.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_0 would be the first term. Let me see. When n=1, a_1=1 +3*a_0. But in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=1+3=4, which would correspond to a_0=1, since a_1=1 +3*a_0=1 +3*1=4. So, a_0=1.\n\nThen, the general solution is a_n = (1/(3 -1))*(3^{n} -1) +1*3^{n}.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (1/2)*(3^{n} -1) +3^{n} = (1/2)*3^{n} -1/2 +3^{n} = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nWait, let's check for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}/2 -1/2)=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2=(3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81)/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n layers, the value is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for such a recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost layer and work outward. Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together, the multiplication gives us 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I think I made a mistake in the number of digits. Let me write it correctly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Ten-thousands place: 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when I multiply by 3, starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this with another method to be sure. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nYes, that checks out. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back a bit. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure that each layer was computed correctly because if any of those layers were wrong, the final answer would be off.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

It was a bit tedious, but by breaking it down layer by layer, I could manage the computation without getting lost. It's like peeling an onion, layer by layer, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's interesting how each layer builds upon the previous one, leading to a rapid increase in the numbers. I was a bit worried about making multiplication errors, especially with larger numbers, but by carefully computing each step and verifying, I can be confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait, so each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume L_n^{(p)} = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, I can compute 3*(Layer 9) as 3*(29524) = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*Layer 9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the value efficiently. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 + 3 times the next nested term. There are nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, all layers seem correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Looking at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a recursive formula. Starting with a_1 = 1 +3=4, then a_2=1+3*4=13, and so on, up to a_9, which we found to be 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, this recursive formula can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it that way. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. Let's check:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct.\n\na_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches our earlier computation.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct.\n\nSo, yes, the general formula works.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what we got before.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the recurrence approach gives the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a sequence that can be computed step by step or recognized as a geometric series.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   - Compute 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   - 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   - 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   - 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   - 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   - 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   - 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   - 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   - 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    - Multiply the result by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Finally, the first digit: 2*3=6. Putting it all together: 6 7 1 7 8 5 7 2. Wait, that seems off because when I did the multiplication step by step, I might have messed up the carry-over. Let me try another approach. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. Hmm, seems like all the steps check out. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the expression from the inside out again, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 Yep, that's the same as before. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. It's a bit tedious with all those layers, but as long as each step is correct, the final answer should be right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so it resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model it that way. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and has the form a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also gives the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, I can be certain that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, we arrive at the value 29524 for the outermost parentheses. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that all checks out. So, I think I've got the right answer here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So when I multiply each digit by 3:\n\n- Units: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n- Tens: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n- Ten thousands: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\n\nWait, but that's only 5 digits, so the result should be 88572.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I got Layer 9 as 29524, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). But let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier because getting 29524 seems like a big number, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572, which is quite large.

Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which would be faster and less error-prone. Let me think about that.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrences of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c and d are constants.\n\nIn this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The general solution is a_n = (a_0 - d/(1 - c)) * c^n + d/(1 - c). Wait, but let me make sure I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, the solution can be written as a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, perhaps it's better to derive it step by step.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me write down the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as we saw earlier, a_9 = 29524.\n\nBut maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to find it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC = 3C + 1\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A\nWhich is 9/2 = 3A\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have n=9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10} first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, the innermost expression after all layers is 29524. Then, the entire original expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the original expression is indeed 3*a_9. Looking back, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, each layer is a_n, starting from a_1 =1 +3, up to a_9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nIn our case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form expression, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different methods all converge to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and then multiply by 3 for the outermost layer. Using a closed-form formula for the recurrence relation confirms the result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1.

So, putting it all together, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct). So, I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if there's a pattern or a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, that's exactly what we're doing here. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 3*C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Using a closed-form formula for the recurrence relation, we find that Layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the next inner term.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

So, I think I did it correctly. Each step builds on the previous one, and the numbers seem to be increasing exponentially, which makes sense because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's a geometric progression, almost like a geometric series. Let me think about whether there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, if I can model this as a recurrence relation, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. Yep, it works. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've covered all the steps, checked each layer, and even derived a general formula to confirm the result. It seems solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost layer to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nSo yes, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 +3 =4\n\na_2 =1 +3a_1\n\na_3=1 +3a_2\n\n...\n\na_9=1 +3a_8\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Specifically, it's a geometric series.\n\nIn general, for such a recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = A*r^{n} + (c/(1 - r)) if r \u22601.\n\nIn our case, c=1, r=3.\n\nSo the solution would be a_n = A*3^n + (1/(1 -3)) = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 =3A \u2192 9/2 =3A \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it more efficiently without having to compute each layer manually.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrived at the same result, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Using a recurrence relation, we find the ninth layer and then compute the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\), so:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, I think I messed up the places. Let me do it more carefully. 29524\nx      3\n---------\nLet's compute each digit starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n9 * 3 = 27. Wait, hold on, 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me count the digits: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, actually, it's 29524. So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\nThere's no more digits, but we have a carryover of 2, so we write that as well. Wait, no, 29524 is 5 digits, so 2 is the ten thousands place, so after multiplying, we should have:\n\n2 (ten thousands) * 3 = 6, plus any carryover. But in our calculation above, after 2*3=6 +2=8, we were done. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the places.\n\nWait, let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nNo more digits, but we have a carryover of 0 now. So the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carry 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this multiplication another way to be sure. Maybe using another method or checking if 88572 divided by 3 equals 29524.\n\n88572 \u00f7 3: 3 into 8 is 2, remainder 2. 3 into 25 (25 is 2*10 +5) is 8, remainder 1. 3 into 17 (1*10 +7) is 5, remainder 2. 3 into 27 is 9, remainder 0. 3 into 2 is 0, remainder 2. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe a better way is to do 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 *3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that matches. So 29524 *3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because if any layer was computed incorrectly, the whole result will be off.\n\nLet me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, a_1=4\n\na_2=1+3*4=13\n\na_3=1+3*13=40\n\na_4=1+3*40=121\n\na_5=1+3*121=364\n\na_6=1+3*364=1093\n\na_7=1+3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1+3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet's find D. Assume a_n = D is a constant solution. Then:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1= C*3^{1} -1/2=4\n\nSo, 3C -1/2=4 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute 3*a_9=3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that the answer is correct, both by computing each layer step by step and by finding a closed-form formula for the recurrence relation.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer is reached. Multiplying the final result by 3 gives the solution.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe I should just do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, so 2 and carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.

Wait, that would be 88572. Let me verify: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct because 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 is 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, subtract (30000 - 29524) = 476 * 3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That confirms it. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all the layers I computed earlier because if any layer was wrong, the final answer will be off. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2192 correct. So, all the layers seem to compute correctly, and the final multiplication is accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's it.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the formula for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's see: Wait, actually, starting from Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, and going up to Layer 9, which would be a_9. So, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nNow, moving to the next digit (the ten thousands place):\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Wait, but we've already done that? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nNow, there are no more digits, but we have a carry over of 0, so we're done.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out: (1+3(1+3)) is Layer 2.\n\nNext: (1+3(1+3(1+3))) is Layer 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer adds one more multiplication. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1).\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2).\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, my initial approach was correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9841 * 3.\n\n9841 * 3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27.\n\nSo, 9841 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a 4-digit number, so after 9, there's no more digits, but we have a carry over of 2, so we write that down as well.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 9841 * 3 = 29523, which is correct because 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 +3=29523. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Let's see.\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, let's count the number of (1+3(...) inside:\n\nAfter the first 3(, there's 1+3(...), which is Layer 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the expression properly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is the innermost, then each layer wraps around that.\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's count how many times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer.\n\nWait, actually, the expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost as Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation of 9 layers is correct, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and the final result being 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nWe can compute each L_n step by step, which we did earlier, leading to L_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final answer is 3*L_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the final answer is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier.

So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern to generalize it, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. However, just for practice, maybe I can find a formula for such nested expressions. Let's see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's solve it: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with the earlier layers: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, as before. So, using the formula, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. I think I counted correctly up to Layer 9, but maybe I should recount each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Let's go through each layer again carefully.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 +3 =4 a_2=1 +3*a_1=1+12=13 a_3=1 +3*a_2=1+39=40 a_4=1 +3*a_3=1+120=121 a_5=1 +3*a_4=1+363=364 a_6=1 +3*a_5=1+1092=1093 a_7=1 +3*a_6=1+3279=3280 a_8=1 +3*a_7=1+9840=9841 a_9=1 +3*a_8=1+29523=29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since each a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3=3/2. Therefore, a_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1=(3^{2})/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication because I might have messed up the carry-over. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Let's add these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because this seems quite a large number, and I might have made a mistake in calculating the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121 Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13 a_3 =1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40 a_4=1 +3*a_3=1+120=121 a_5=1 +3*a_4=1+363=364 a_6=1 +3*a_5=1+1092=1093 a_7=1 +3*a_6=1+3279=3280 a_8=1 +3*a_7=1+9840=9841 a_9=1 +3*a_8=1+29523=29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\(a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Using the recurrence relation, we determine that the closed-form solution for each layer \\(a_n\\) is \\((3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\). For the 9th layer, this gives \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying by 3 as per the original expression yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me add commas for clarity: 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That checks out. So, I think I did that correctly. Let me recap to make sure I didn't skip any layers. The original expression had nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the entire thing was multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1 was 4, then Layer 2 was 13, Layer 3 was 40, Layer 4 was 121, Layer 5 was 364, Layer 6 was 1093, Layer 7 was 3280, Layer 8 was 9841, Layer 9 was 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each one manually. However, if there were more layers, I might look for a recursive formula or a geometric series approach. Let me think about whether this sequence has a pattern. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K = 1 + 3K \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods, step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...).
