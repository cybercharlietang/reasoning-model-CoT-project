    "text": " Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. Great, the formula works. So, since we have 9 layers, the outermost expression is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, if I didn't realize the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer as I did initially, and it would have led me to the same answer.

So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Let me see if I can find a particular solution. Let's assume a steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = A. Then, A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Hmm, but our terms are all positive and increasing, so maybe this isn't the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can solve the recurrence relation more formally. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.

When n approaches infinity, if the recurrence converges, but in this case, since each term depends on the previous one multiplied by 3, it's diverging. But maybe we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's unroll the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*a_{n-2} = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2} Continuing this way, we get a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*a_0. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1. So perhaps a_0 would be 1? Let me check: If n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. If a_1=4, then 4=1 + 3*a_0 => a_0=(4-1)/3=1. So yes, a_0=1. Therefore, the general formula would be a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k - something? Wait, perhaps it's better to express it as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1 should be 4.

The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c), provided c \u2260 1. In this case, c = 3, d = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3). Let's compute that. First, compute 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, a_n = (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Simplify that: (9/2)*3^{n-1} is the same as (9*3^{n-1})/2. So, a_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2.

For n=3: a_3 = (9*3^2 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which also matches. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9 = (9*3^{8} -1)/2. Let's compute that.

So, 54000 + 4500 = 58500, +540=59040, +9=59049. So, 9*6561=59049. Then, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.

Assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.

Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value. But in our case, all the a_n are integers. Maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I need to adjust it. Alternatively, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write it as a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let's choose c such that the equation becomes homogeneous. So, a_n + c = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + 3c - c. Comparing with the original equation, 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + (3c - c) = a_n. Therefore, 3c - c = 0 => 2c = 0 => c = 0. That doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution is the general solution to the homogeneous equation plus a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the equation: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.

The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).

The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, which is what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that the solution is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " The general term: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see for n=1: a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I need to adjust the formula. Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms to see the pattern: a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Wait, so the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1 = 4. Hmm, that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, no: in the problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Now, to solve this recurrence, we can use the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a2=13. Similarly, n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which matches a3=40. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula, we arrive at the same answer.

The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

    "text": " Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, so the solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, the value at layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Which matches the earlier result.

    "text": " The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, solving this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} So, A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3 multiplied by a series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Let's denote the innermost term as S. Then, each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the total expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as above. But since I already solved it using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's find a homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9. So, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Now, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that matches the earlier result. So, using the recurrence relation method, I also get 88572. That's reassuring.

Assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate the terms: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's 3*(a_9), and since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, regardless of the method, I end up with 88572 as the final answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Now, the expression is 3*a_9, so 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, but n starts at 1, right? So when n=1, a_1 = 4. So plug in n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that also confirms it.

The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the ratio. The solution can be found using the formula for such recursions. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*r^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = c + r*K => K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r).

The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it formally. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K.

Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute step by step, or use the recurrence relation, or find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different methods all lead to the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution: characteristic equation is r = 3, so homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Particular solution: since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a constant solution A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I found earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. I double-checked using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, and both lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.
