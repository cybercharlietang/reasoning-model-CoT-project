    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The recurrence is linear: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation might give a formula for a_n, which could then be used to compute a_9 directly. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, the first term is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. So plugging n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 4 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.

Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's substitute the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B So, left side: A*3^n + B Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1 Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1 Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works.

Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation to find a formula, I end up with the same answer.

To find C, we can solve for the steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = C. So, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

The general solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, the initial term is a_1 = 4, and the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. Let me write the recurrence as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.

So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. I think this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct, and using the formula also leads me to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me find the solution. First, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

Let me test this formula with the first few layers: For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. For n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this method confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression.

Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the equation: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Now, equate both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, 0 = 1 + 2D => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct.

Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, in this case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, actually, the initial term is a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. So, maybe we can adjust the formula accordingly. Let me think: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier results: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13.

Let me find A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but perhaps it's easier to compute each term step by step as I did before. Alternatively, let's see if we can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.

Let's compute a few terms and see if we can find a pattern. a1 = 4\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term minus something. Let me check:\n\na2 = 13 = 3*4 +1? 3*4=12 +1=13, yes.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13=40\n\nSimilarly, a4=1 + 3*a3=1 + 120=121.\n\nSo the recurrence is correct. To find a closed-form, let's solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is:\n\na_n = c^n * (a0 + d/(c - 1)) - d/(c -1)\n\nWait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. So c=3, d=1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a1=4:\n\na1= A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4\n\nSo 3A =4 +1/2=9/2\n\nThus, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a2=13.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So for layer 9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers.

Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let me assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^{n} + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D So, left side: C*3^{n} + D = right side: 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D.

Now, set equal to left-hand side: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.

So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.

Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula seems valid. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9, so plugging n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't see the recurrence relation, computing each layer step by step is also feasible, as I did earlier. Both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, solving this recurrence relation: The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, substituting the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Comparing both sides, the A*3^n terms cancel out. So, B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a linear function. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_p. Plugging in, a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4, we can solve for C. a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the two methods (iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation) give the same result. So, I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is: a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B.

The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.
