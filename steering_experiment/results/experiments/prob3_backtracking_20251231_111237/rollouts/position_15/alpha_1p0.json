    "text": " Let\u2019s say the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2 wraps around it, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Wait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is multiplied by 3 after computing the inner part. Let me try to compute Layer 1 first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be increasing by a certain amount each time. Let me keep going to see if I can spot a pattern or a formula. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the total is 88572. Let me just double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then 3*29524=88572, correct. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to write out the first few terms again: a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Hmm, looking at these numbers, I think they might follow a pattern related to powers of 3. Let me see: 4 = (3^2 +1)/2? Wait, 3^2 is 9, so (9 +1)/2 is 5, which is not 4. Hmm, maybe another approach. Alternatively, let me see if each term is 3 times the previous term minus something. Let's check: a_2=13, a_1=4. 3*a_1=12, and 12 +1=13, which is a_2. Similarly, a_3=1 + 3*a_2=1 + 39=40. So, it's a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P=1 => P= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. n=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked both by computing each layer step by step and by finding a closed-form formula, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let's say the innermost expression is layer 1, then the next one is layer 2, and so on up to layer 9. So, layer 1: 1 + 3. Then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1). Layer3: 1 + 3*(layer2), and so on until layer9. Then the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, starting with layer1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, layer1 = 4. Now, layer2 is 1 + 3*(layer1). Since layer1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, layer2 = 13. Moving on to layer3: 1 + 3*(layer2). Layer2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, layer3 = 40. Layer4: 1 + 3*(layer3). Layer3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So, layer4 = 121. Layer5: 1 + 3*(layer4). Layer4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, layer5 = 364. Layer6: 1 + 3*(layer5). Layer5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, layer6 = 1093. Layer7: 1 + 3*(layer6). Layer6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, layer7 = 3280. Layer8: 1 + 3*(layer7). Layer7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, layer8 = 9841. Layer9: 1 + 3*(layer8). Layer8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, layer9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(layer9), which is 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*29524. Hmm, let me break that down. 29524 * 3. I can compute this step by step: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, adding up the products: 60000 + 27000 is 87000. 87000 + 1500 is 88500. 88500 + 60 is 88560. 88560 + 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: layer1: 1+3=4. layer2: 1+3*4=13. layer3:1+3*13=40. layer4:1+3*40=121. layer5:1+3*121=364. layer6:1+3*364=1093. layer7:1+3*1093=3280. layer8:1+3*3280=9841. layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent.

The original expression has nine layers of 1+3(...), right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking back: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach '1+3(' starts a new layer, so starting from the first '(', each time we have a new layer. Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, it's 9 layers, right? Because each time we have a 1+3(...), and that's repeated 9 times.\n\nWait, but when I computed, I had Layer 1 to Layer 9, each corresponding to each opening parenthesis. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach '1+3(' adds a new layer, and the total number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 9. So, 9 layers in total.\n\nTherefore, each step I computed correctly, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3 at the end. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute this using a different approach, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let me think: If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis matches the result I obtained earlier by step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer adds a term that's a power of 3. Let me see if that's the case.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 -1)/2. Because (9 -1)/2=4.\n\na_2 =1 +3*4=13. Which is (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13.\n\na_3=1 +3*13=40, which is (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40.\n\na_4=121=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121.\n\na_5=364=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364.\n\na_6=1093=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093.\n\na_7=3280=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280.\n\na_8=9841=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841.\n\na_9=29524=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524.\n\nSo, indeed, each a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think this confirms that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute one of the layers again to check for any arithmetic errors.\n\nLet's take Layer 5: 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 363+1=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. 1092+1=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093.\n\n3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 3279+1=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280.\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000+840=9840. 9840+1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841.\n\n3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 29523+1=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each step checks out. Therefore, I can be confident that the final result is correct.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize that each term is a geometric series, but in this case, since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's more of a linear recurrence, which I already solved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but in this case, the series isn't a simple geometric series because each term depends on the previous one. So, the linear recurrence approach seems more appropriate.\n\nIn any case, both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give me the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let\u2019s define the innermost expression as Layer 1, then Layer 2 wraps around that, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, wait, that might not be the right approach. Maybe it's better to start from the innermost part and work my way out. So, the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9. Let me try that. Let me start with the innermost expression: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524*3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000 \u2192 60000+27000=87000\n\n500*3=1500 \u2192 87000+1500=88500\n\n20*3=60 \u2192 88500+60=88560\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 88560+12=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a formula. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nI can see that each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, as we calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1}\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2}\\)\n- ...\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 8}\\)\n\nCalculating each layer step by step:\n\n1.

Then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), etc., up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I can compute each Layer from 1 to 9, I can substitute each into the next until I reach Layer 9, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Let's try that approach.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:  \nLayer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1 = 4:\n\nLayer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nGreat, Layer 2 is 13.

Then, adding 1: 39 + 1 = 40.\n\nSo, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120. Adding 1: 120 + 1 = 121.\n\nLayer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\nLet me compute 3*121. 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300 + 60 + 3 = 363.

Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524.\n\nLayer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we compute 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524: Let's break it down:\n\n3*20000 = 60000  \n3*9000 = 27000  \n3*500 = 1500  \n3*20 = 60  \n3*4 = 12  \n\nAdding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.

Let me compute 3*29524 again just to be sure.\n\n29524  \n*       3  \n--------  \n88572  \n\nYes, that's correct. Each digit multiplied by 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.  \n2*3=6 +1=7.  \n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.  \n2*3=6 +1=7.  \n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.  \n2*3=6 +2=8.  \nNo more digits, so write down the carryover 2.\n\nWait, actually, writing it out:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.  \nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.  \nNext: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.  \nNext: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.  \nNext: 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.  \nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.  \nNo more digits, so write the carryover 2 at the beginning.\n\nSo, reading from top: 2, 7, 5, 7, 2, 8. Wait, that's not correct because the digits are reversed. Wait, no, actually, when multiplying, you start from the rightmost digit and move left, so the result should be 88572. Let me check:\n\n29524  \n* 3  \n= ?\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.  \nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write down 7.  \nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.  \nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.  \nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.  \nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.  \nNo more digits, so write down the carryover 2.\n\nSo, writing the digits from top to bottom (units to higher places), we have 2, 7, 5, 7, 2, 8. Wait, that would be 87572, but that's not matching 88572. Hmm, I think I might have messed up the order.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you write down the multiplication, you start from the right, so the first digit is 2 (units), then 7 (tens), then 5 (hundreds), then 7 (thousands), then 2 (ten thousands), and finally 8 (hundred thousands). But wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.  \n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.  \n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1.  \n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.  \n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carryover 0.\n\nSo, writing the result from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that's 27588, but that's only 5 digits. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing the order.\n\nWait, no, actually, the multiplication should be:\n\n29524  \n*     3  \n-------  \n88572\n\nLet me verify using another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3  \n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3  \n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3  \n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12  \nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 60 = 88560  \n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 also checks out. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. To solve it, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\n1. **Layer 1**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let's say layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3 Then layer 2 is 1 + 3(layer1) Layer 3 is 1 + 3(layer2) And so on, up to layer 9. Wait, actually, looking at the expression, it's 3 multiplied by each layer, so maybe each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Hmm, maybe I should think of each layer as the term inside the parentheses. So, let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let's define each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as follows: 20,000 *3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000+1,500=88,500; 88,500+60=88,560; 88,560+12=88,572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the layers. Starting from L1: 1 + 3 =4, correct. L2:1 +3*4=1+12=13, correct. L3:1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. L4:1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. L5:1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. L6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. L7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. L8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. L9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then 3*29524=88,572, which seems correct.

Let me check: The outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost expression is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer wraps that with another 1 + 3*(...). So, if I compute Layer 1 as 1 + 3, then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), etc., up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). That seems right. Let me try computing each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, the total is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 and so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r and c are constants. In this case, r=3 and c=1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + B, where B is a particular solution. Let me find B. Assume a particular solution is constant, so a_n = B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. If I expand it, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) Let me try expanding the innermost layers first and see if I can find a pattern. Let's denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) Let me see if I can express E in terms of itself, but that might not be straightforward because each layer is a separate multiplication. Alternatively, since we've already found a formula for a_n, and E = 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then E = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144 /2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but in the given problem, the outermost expression is 3 times something, so perhaps I should adjust my layers accordingly. Let me think again.

So, is the final answer 88572? Hmm, but let me check again because sometimes when I do multiple layers, I might have miscounted the layers. Let me count how many layers there are in the original problem.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen, 1+3(Layer1) is Layer2.\n\nThen, 1+3(Layer2) is Layer3.\n\nContinuing until Layer9, which is the outermost.\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers. So, my calculation should be correct. But let me try to compute it in another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me find D. To find D, we can set the recurrence equal when a_n is constant, so:\n\nD = 3*D + 1\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds for all layers up to n=9.\n\nTherefore, the value of the innermost expression, Layer9, is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this value, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute Layer9 again using the formula:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using a different approach, such as expanding the expression.\n\nBut given that the expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, the recursive approach seems the most straightforward.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this expansion, after n steps, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0\n\nWait, but a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So, if we consider a_0 as 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*1 =4.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 =1 +3*a_1=1 +3*4=13.\n\nSo, in general, a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence.\n\nThe solution we found earlier is correct, so using that, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nI think this is solid. To make sure, let me compute 3*29524 manually:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" parts:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nSo, the innermost is \"1+3\", then each subsequent layer adds another \"1+3(\".\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's count:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nIn the original problem, the expression is 3 times a sum, which itself has 9 layers, so the innermost is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I miscounted. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first \"1+3\" is Layer1.\n\nThen each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nStarting from the first \"(\", after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...\n2. (1 + 3(...\n3. (1 + 3(...\n4. (1 + 3(...\n5. (1 + 3(...\n6. (1 + 3(...\n7. (1 + 3(...\n8. (1 + 3(...\n9. (1 + 3(...)\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses, meaning 9 layers. So, my earlier calculation is correct, with Layer9 being the outermost, and the entire expression being 3*Layer9=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial breakdown, I labeled the innermost as Layer1, then moving outward, up to Layer9, which is the outermost expression inside the first 3*(...). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using another approach, such as expanding each term. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost term:\n\nLayer1:1 +3=4.\n\nLayer2:1 +3*(4)=1+12=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*(40)=1 +120=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*(121)=1 +363=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*(364)=1 +1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*(1093)=1 +3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*(3280)=1 +9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*(9841)=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3, but given the structure, it's more straightforward to compute each layer step by step.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After evaluating all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the value of the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{inner expression})\\).\n\n2. **Start from the innermost layer (Layer 1):**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\).\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\).\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\).\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\).\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\).\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\).\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\).\n\n4. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - Final result: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let's say the innermost is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) Hmm, wait, that seems too complicated. Maybe I should start from the very innermost part, which is the last 1 + 3, and work my way out. Let me try that. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's simple enough: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 1). Since Layer 1 was 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 result is 13. Now, moving to Layer 3, which is 1 + 3*(result from Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 result is 40. Let me write this down step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nOkay, so far, so good. Let's continue this process.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Got it.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nHmm, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nOkay, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3*1093: Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times this entire nested expression. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. Let me confirm that. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nNext: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the product is 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 =1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a big number. Let me check the multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 * 3 another way. Maybe add 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nOkay, so I think I did that correctly. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 +3*4=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Correct.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, a_1 would actually be the innermost layer, which is 1+3=4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 =1 + 3*4=13.\n\na_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +3*13=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form for such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r=3 and c=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_0 - c/(1 - r)) * r^n + c/(1 - r), but since r > 1, the formula is slightly different.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^n, and the particular solution is a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = r*K + c => K - rK = c => K(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r).\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say n starts at 1, with a_1=4.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*r^1 + c/(1 - r) = A*r + c/(1 - r) =4.\n\nWe have r=3, c=1, so:\n\nA*3 + 1/(1 -3) =4.\n\nCompute 1/(1-3)=1/(-2)=-1/2.\n\nSo, 3A -1/2=4.\n\nThen, 3A=4 +1/2=9/2.\n\nThus, A=(9/2)/3= (9/2)*(1/3)= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nIf a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then for n=1, a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result I got earlier by step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), the total number of layers is nine, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) directly, but that would be tedious. Alternatively, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to ensure consistency.\n\nFor example, a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\na_5=(3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\na_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\na_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\na_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\na_9=(3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, everything checks out.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested pattern in the expression. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). We compute each layer from the innermost outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{(Layer 9 result)}\\).

    "text": " Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (no more layers inside) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. So, if I compute Layer 1 first, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on, I should be able to get the final answer. Let's try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Alright, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me check if this pattern continues. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original problem is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000; 9000*3 = 27000; 500*3 = 1500; 20*3 = 60; 4*3 = 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

So, I think I did this right. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and by working from the inside out, I was able to compute each step without getting lost in the complexity of the nested expressions.

    "text": " Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3. That's simple enough. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9 = 1 + 3*L8. Then the entire expression is 3*(L9). Hmm, that might work. Let me try that approach. So, starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, easy. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, this is getting bigger each time. Let's keep going. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Well, 29524*3. Let me do that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Starting from L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3A => A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Okay, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for L9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. The original expression is 3*(L9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so 177147 -3=177144, then divide by 2:177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work to make sure there are no mistakes. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Let me denote each expression as E1, E2, E3, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost and E9 is the outermost. So, starting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1. E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9. Then the entire expression is 3*E9. Wait, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(E9), where E9 is 1 + 3*(E8). So, maybe I should compute each E starting from E1. Let's do that. E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. Let me compute a few more terms to see if I can find a pattern or a formula. E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

Let me do the multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6, write down 6. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Okay, that matches. So, the total is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing E9. Let me go back and check each step again because one mistake can throw off the entire calculation. Starting with E1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. E2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. E3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. E4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. E5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. E6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. E7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. E8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. E9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each step is of the form E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for E(n). The recurrence relation is E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is E(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1) => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition E(1) = 4. So, E(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: E(1) = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: E(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: E(3) = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, E(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Therefore, E(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^10=59,049. So, E(9) = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*E(9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^10 - 1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59,049, so 3^11=177,147. Then, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Same result. So, whether I compute each step manually or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the nested terms from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( E(n) = 1 + 3 \\times E(n-1) \\), starting with \\( E(1) = 4 \\). This recurrence relation is solved using the formula \\( E(n) = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( E(9) = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29,524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's say the innermost part is layer 1, then layer 2 wraps around it, and so on up to layer 9. So, layer 1: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) Wait, no, actually, the innermost part is just 1 + 3, right? Because after that, each layer adds another 3 times something. Wait, let me check. Looking back at the original expression, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))) with nine layers. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3 times the next inner expression. Let me try to parse it correctly. Let's define each layer starting from the innermost. Let me think: The innermost expression is 1 + 3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3 times that result. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result, and so on, up to nine layers. Wait, but in the original problem, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, let me compute that first. So, layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

So, the result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems a bit high. Let me verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*a, where a is the result of the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, each term is built by multiplying the previous term by 3 and adding 1. So, the nth term can be expressed recursively. Let me denote a_n as the value at the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value at each layer follows a specific pattern.

Now, moving to L2: L2 = 1 + 3(L1). Since L1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, L2 = 13. Next, L3 = 1 + 3(L2). L2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, L3 = 40. Now, L4 = 1 + 3(L3). L3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. So, L4 = 121. Moving on to L5 = 1 + 3(L4). L4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, L5 = 364. Next, L6 = 1 + 3(L5). L5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. So, L6 = 1093. Now, L7 = 1 + 3(L6). L6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is... let me compute that. 1093 * 3: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Therefore, L7 = 3280. Next, L8 = 1 + 3(L7). L7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, L8 = 9841. Now, finally, L9 = 1 + 3(L8). L8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Hmm, that's a bigger number. Let me compute that step by step. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Therefore, L9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3(L9), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, L4 = 121, L5 = 364, L6 = 1093, L7 = 3280, L8 = 9841, L9 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or see if there's a pattern that allows me to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding each step by step seems manageable. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated step by step. After computing all nine layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the last layer's value by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply L9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9. So, if I compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2, and keep going until Layer 9, I should be able to get the final result. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That was simple enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: Let's break it down. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially since the numbers get quite large. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, the outermost expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let me do it digit by digit. 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 3*3 = 9, plus 1 is 10. So, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, that might not be correct because the outermost layer is 3*(...). Let me check: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3 times something, and that something is 1 plus 3 times another expression. So, perhaps I should consider each nested layer as a step where each step is 1 + 3*(previous step). Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, but in the original expression, after the innermost 1+3, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...).

So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because each layer's result is increasing exponentially, which makes sense because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series. Let me think about whether there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nActually, this looks like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*a_1 = a_2.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant.\n\nLet me find B. Let's assume that a_n approaches a steady state as n increases, so a_n = a_{n-1} = a. Then, a = 1 + 3a => a - 3a = 1 => -2a = 1 => a = -1/2. Hmm, but that's negative, which doesn't make sense here because all our terms are positive. So maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nAlternatively, let's solve the recurrence relation step by step.\n\nWe have a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, yes, that's consistent with what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nNext, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363.

Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n----------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88,572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. Hmm, but let me check with another method. Maybe using another approach or seeing if there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that each layer is following a pattern. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLooking at the expression: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer was 1 + 3, so a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can try to solve this recurrence relation. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 1\n\n-2*C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because 3*29524 might not be 88572. Let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That's consistent.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(29524).

Let's break it down differently: 29524*3 = (29000 + 524)*3 = 29000*3 +524*3. 29000*3=87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500 +72=1572. Then, 87000 +1572=88572. Yep, same result.

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Therefore, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1, we get 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... let me compute that. 364 times 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. Therefore, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is... let me calculate that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is... 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8).

So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we compute 3*29524. Let's calculate that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Therefore, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, that seems quite large. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake, especially in the multiplication steps because those are where errors often occur.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Let me write it down properly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5*3=15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\nNext digit: 9*3=27. Write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 875272? Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3 is actually 88572. Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me use another method.\n\nCompute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000 = 87000\n\n87000 +1500 = 88500\n\n88500 +60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total is 88572. So, my initial calculation was correct. The confusion came when I tried to do it digit by digit, but breaking it down into place values works better.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer builds upon the previous one, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's a recursive-like structure, where each term depends on the one before it. By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I was able to build up to the final result without getting lost in the complexity of the nested parentheses.\n\nI think I've got it right. Each step seems consistent, and I double-checked the multiplications to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems straightforward. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So 363 + 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 364*3.

Wait, no, hold on: 3*364 is 1092, and then adding 1 gives 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Well, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So Layer 7 is 3279 + 1 = 3280. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, 3*1093 is 3279, then adding 1 gives 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just go through my steps again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Each step, I computed the innermost layer first, then built up each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result. Each time, I multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, for example, Layer 2 was 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3 was 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. Each multiplication by 3 and addition of 1 builds up the number quite rapidly. So, when I got to Layer 9, it was 29524, and then multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step seems logical and follows from the previous one. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find the value of each layer step by step until we reach the outermost layer. Multiplying the final layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let's say the innermost part is layer 1, then the next one is layer 2, and so on up to layer 9, with the outermost being layer 9. So, starting with layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Since that's the innermost expression. Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so layer 1 simplifies to 4. Now, moving to layer 2. Layer 2 is: 1 + 3*(result from layer 1) So, substituting the result from layer 1, which is 4: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Layer 2 simplifies to 13. Now, layer 3: 1 + 3*(result from layer 2) So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, layer 3 is 40. Moving on to layer 4: 1 + 3*(result from layer 3) That's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 simplifies to 121. Next, layer 5: 1 + 3*(result from layer 4) So, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(result from layer 5) Which is 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate that: 3*364 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Layer 6 is 1,093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(result from layer 6) That's 1 + 3*1,093. Calculating 3*1,093: 3*1,000 is 3,000, 3*93 is 279, so 3,000 + 279 = 3,279. Then, adding 1 gives 3,280. Layer 7 is 3,280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(result from layer 7) So, 1 + 3*3,280. Let's compute 3*3,280: 3*3,000 is 9,000, 3*280 is 840, so 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Adding 1 gives 9,841. Layer 8 is 9,841. Finally, layer 9: 1 + 3*(result from layer 8) That's 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 3*9,841. Hmm, 3*9,000 is 27,000, 3*800 is 2,400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400, then 29,400 + 123 = 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives 29,524. So, layer 9 simplifies to 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result from layer 9. So, the whole expression is 3*(29,524). Let me compute that. 3*29,524: 3*20,000 is 60,000, 3*9,000 is 27,000, 3*500 is 1,500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, actually, maybe breaking it down digit by digit is better. Let me do it step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it out:\n\n    29,524\n  x      3\n  --------\n    ?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, we get 88,572. So, 3*29,524 is 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the layers. Starting from layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1,093. Layer 7: 1+3*1,093=3,280. Layer 8: 1+3*3,280=9,841. Layer 9: 1+3*9,841=29,524. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. That seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the steps. Each layer was computed correctly, and the multiplication at the end is accurate. So, I think the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost expression, each layer is computed by multiplying the result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each subsequent layer until the outermost expression is reached. Finally, the entire result is multiplied by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\)\n10. **Final Step:** Multiply the result by 3: \\(3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572\\)\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.

Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840.

Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI think I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\nThen each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3(...))\n\n...\n\nEach time, we go out another layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nLooking at the LaTeX code: each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, there are nine \"1+3(\" instances, each followed by another parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, but when I initially labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, I think I only went up to Layer 9, which was the outermost. But perhaps I miscounted how many layers there are. Let me try again.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. Next: (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but in the given expression, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear? Let me count:\n\nStarting after the initial 3(, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3(, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\", each followed by another parenthesis. Therefore, the innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3), then Layer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)), and so on up to Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But maybe I miscounted the layers, leading to an incorrect result.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers. Let's parse the expression step by step.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's list them:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1))\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3))\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4))\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5))\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6))\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7))\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8))\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my initial calculation was correct, leading to 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 88572 seems like a large number, but perhaps that's correct. Let me check each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364:\n\n364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 41*3=123. So, 27000+2400=29400+123=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again. Maybe I should compute it differently.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first saw the problem, I thought maybe there was a pattern or a formula that could be applied instead of computing each layer manually. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find B, set a_n = a_{n-1} = B.\n\nSo, B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThen, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same result, confirming that my initial step-by-step calculation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nMoving on to Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so it's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nNow, Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Therefore, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nProceeding to Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nMoving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we have 3 * 29524. Let's compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that multiplication again because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15, plus the carried 2 is 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n0 * 3 = 0. Write down 0.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so I might have miscounted the digits. Let me write it down properly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 87572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier result of 88572. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572? Wait, no, because when I write it down, the digits are:\n\nStarting from the right:\n2 (units)\n7 (tens)\n5 (hundreds)\n7 (thousands)\n8 (ten thousands)\nand then the next digit is 8, but wait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when I multiply by 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nWait, that would give us 88,572. But when I write it down, 29,524 \u00d7 3 is 88,572. So my initial calculation was correct. So 3 \u00d7 29,524 is indeed 88,572. I must have miscounted the digits earlier when I thought I got 87,572. So the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20,000\u00d73 + 9,000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding them up:\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29,524 is indeed 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me check each layer again quickly because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, after double-checking each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. After calculating each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4  \n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13  \n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40  \n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121  \n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364  \n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1,093  \n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 3,280  \n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 9,841  \n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 29,524  \n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:  \n3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me consider the innermost part first. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? Because after that, each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next expression.

Then, the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(result from step 2).\n\nAnd so on, until we reach the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses starting from the left. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, each 3(1 + 3( ... )). Let's count the number of times 3(1 + 3( appears. Hmm, actually, each layer adds another 3(1 + 3(...)), so perhaps there are 9 layers? Let me check: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer out adds another 3(...). So, if I have 9 sets of parentheses, that would mean 9 layers.

So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we then multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. Because each layer is part of the expression, so when I compute Layer 1, that's the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which would be 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we multiply that by 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me recount the layers because I might have miscounted.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer, so let's count how many times that happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3: that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, we have another 1 + 3(...), so that's Layer 2.\n\nContinuing this way, each time we have a new 1 + 3(...), so up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, so when I compute up to Layer 9, that's the innermost part of the entire expression. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I computed Layer 9 as 29524, so the final result would be 3 * 29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, inside that first 3(...), there's another 1 + 3(...), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs.\n\nFrom the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each time moving out, another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to visualize the expression as a tree. Each time you have a 1 + 3( ... ), the ... is another similar expression. So, the depth of the nesting is 9, which would mean 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1, then each layer out adds another 3*(Layer n-1). So, up to Layer 9, which would be the innermost part of the entire expression, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me confirm each step carefully.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Because 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because when I count the number of layers, I might have miscounted. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears, not counting the last \"1 + 3)\".\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nThen, inside that, another 1 + 3(...\n\nContinuing until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, each time we have a 1 + 3(, that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2.    1 + 3(\n3.        1 + 3(\n4.            1 + 3(\n5.                1 + 3(\n6.                    1 + 3(\n7.                        1 + 3(\n8.                            1 + 3(\n9.                                1 + 3\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, Layer 1 is the innermost, 1 + 3, which is 4.\n\nThen Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nWait, each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nSo, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me think about the general form. Suppose we have a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nWhich is what I have above.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me check that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWait, let me verify this with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the general term is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 layers, the value would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the Layer 9 value I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times.\n\nWait, but I think the way I approached it earlier is correct, computing each layer step by step.\n\nWait, to ensure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that all checks out.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 27 + carryover 2? Wait, no, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, let me compute it properly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, the value after 9 layers is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, perhaps I can compute one more layer manually.\n\nWait, for example, Layer 5 is 364.\n\nThen Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so all layers check out.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1, then Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9, I can substitute each layer's value into the next one. That sounds manageable. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Layer 1 equals 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364, let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCalculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, plus 240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCalculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my calculation again because 29524 * 3 should be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo writing it out:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nNext: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nNext: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, but when I added 60000 +27000, that's 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it directly.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo writing the digits together: 7 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I messed up the order.\n\nWait, let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo writing it out from top to bottom, the digits would be:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n2 (units place)\n\n7 (tens place)\n\n5 (hundreds place)\n\n7 (thousands place)\n\n7 (ten thousands place)\n\n8 (hundred thousands place)\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Wait, 29524 is 29,524, which is 5 digits. Multiplying by 3 gives 88,572, which is 5 digits as well because 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-by-digit, I think I might have misaligned the digits. Let me try again.\n\nLet me write it down properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x       3\n   ------------\n     ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo writing it out from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. But wait, that's 88,572.\n\nWait, no, because when you write it down, the digits are:\n\nStarting from the units place: 2\n\nTens place: 7\n\nHundreds place: 5\n\nThousands place: 8\n\nTen-thousands place: 8\n\nSo the number is 88,572. That makes sense because 29,524 * 3 is 88,572.\n\nSo the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might make a mistake.\n\nLet me verify each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that for a moment.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Specifically, it's a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify this formula with the layers we've already computed.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Same result.\n\nSo, another way to compute this is to recognize the pattern and use the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, which gives a direct computation without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's pretty cool, but since I was able to compute each layer manually, I think the step-by-step approach is also valid, especially for someone who might not immediately see the pattern or the formula.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable layers and computing each one step by step, I arrived at the final answer of 88,572. Additionally, recognizing the recurrence relation allowed me to confirm the result using a formula, which is a good practice to ensure accuracy, especially with more complex problems.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next layer})\\).

    "text": " Let's say layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1), and so on until layer 9, which is the outermost. So, layer 1: 1 + 3 layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) ... up to layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8), and then the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, let's compute each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute 3*4 first: 3*4=12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. So, layer 2 is 13. Moving on to layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Compute 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40. So, layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120. Add 1: 121. So, layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then add 1: 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: Let's break it down. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1093. So, layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 3280. So, layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. Adding them together: 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then add 1: 9841. So, layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me do it step by step. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Now, add those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29524. So, layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me check my calculations again because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me go back through each layer to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 again: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let me compute this again. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those: 60000 + 27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But let me try another way to compute 3*29524 just to be sure. 29524 * 3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's digit-wise, so let's do it step by step. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8. So, 29524*3=88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. I think I did that correctly. Each step built upon the previous one, and I verified each computation. So, I'm confident that the result is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": " Let me denote each innermost expression as E1, then the next one as E2, and so on, up to E9, which is the outermost expression. So, E1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then E2 is 1 + 3(E1). E3 is 1 + 3(E2), and so on until E9, which is 1 + 3(E8). Then the entire expression is 3(E9). So, if I compute E1 through E9 step by step, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let's start with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Now, E2 = 1 + 3(E1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so E2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, E3 = 1 + 3(E2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so E3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Moving on to E4: E4 = 1 + 3(E3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so E4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Now, E5 = 1 + 3(E4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so E5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Next, E6 = 1 + 3(E5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Thus, E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Now, E7 = 1 + 3(E6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Therefore, E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next, E8 = 1 + 3(E7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Thus, E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, E9 = 1 + 3(E8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(E9), which is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from E1 to E9, each step seems to follow logically. Each time, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1. Then, finally, multiplied by 3 again. Let me verify a couple of the intermediate steps to be safe. For example, E3 was 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is correct. E4 was 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. E5 was 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. E6 was 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. E7 was 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. E8 was 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. E9 was 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yeah, that seems right. I don't see any errors in my calculations.

    "text": " Let me think... So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 3 times the next inner layer. Let me try to represent this with variables to make it easier. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1. Since L1 is 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, I see a pattern here. Each subsequent layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try to compute each layer one by one. Starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Got that. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Moving on, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times (L9), right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, after computing L9, I need to multiply it by 3 to get the final result. So, let me compute that: Final result = 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524: 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carryover. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9000 = 58524, 58524 + 500 = 59024, 59024 + 24 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Okay, so 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Maybe I should verify each step again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's go back through each layer: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying L9 by 3 gives 88572. So, that's the final answer. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since I'm doing it step by step, I think my approach is fine. But just to confirm, let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms to see the pattern: a1 = 4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. Hmm, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 3, but with an added constant. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let me solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next inner layer. By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on. So, let's compute each layer step by step. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute step by step: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7.

Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.

Starting from the right:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when I multiply by 3, I should have:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927.\n5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n9\u00d73=27 \u21927, carryover 2.\n5\u00d73=15 +2=17 \u21927, carryover 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, right? So, when I multiply each digit:\n\n- 4\u00d73=12 \u21922, carryover1\n- 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927, carryover0\n- 5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover1\n- 9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2\n- 2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928, carryover0\n- 9\u00d73=27 \u21927, carryover2\n- 5\u00d73=15 +2=17 \u21927, carryover1\n- 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927, carryover0\n\nWait, but that seems like more digits than the original number. Let me write it correctly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7   3\n------\n?\n\nLet me compute each digit step by step:\n\n1. Units place: 4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n2. Tens place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n3. Hundreds place: 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n4. Thousands place: 9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n5. Ten-thousands place: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d73 should be 88572? Let me check with another method. Let me compute 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) \u00d73\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 +4\u00d73\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000 =87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d73=88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me just double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when doing multiple layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2:1+3\u00d74=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3:1+3\u00d713=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1+3\u00d740=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1+3\u00d7121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1+3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1+3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1+3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1+3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4. L3: 1 + 3*(L2), and so on until L9. So, each layer depends on the previous one. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nMoving on to L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1093*3. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Now, 3*9841. Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 multiplied by (L9). So, after computing L9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3=60000,\n\n9000*3=27000,\n\n500*3=1500,\n\n20*3=60,\n\n4*3=12.\n\nAdding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems quite large. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check my calculations again because I might have miscalculated L9 or one of the previous layers.\n\nStarting again from L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, L9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000*3 = 27000. Adding to 60000: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\nNext, 500*3 = 1500. Adding to 87000: 87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\nThen, 20*3 = 60. Adding to 88500: 88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\nFinally, 4*3 = 12. Adding to 88560: 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula that applies here. The expression resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time we add 1 and then multiply by 3. This seems recursive. Maybe I can model this with a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is L1. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is L2. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is L3, and so on.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nTo find A and B, let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtracting A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtracting 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1.\n\nThus, B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2.\n\nSo, 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A.\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3A.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier terms:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is L9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, L9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9, so 3*29524 =88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3*29524 step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6, plus 2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another multiplication method:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nCompute each digit:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9\u00d73=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, indeed, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations. Each step built upon the previous one, and the formula using the recurrence relation confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Wait, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, perhaps I should compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2 using Layer 1's result, and so on until I get to Layer 9, and then multiply the final result by 3. Let me try that. So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Calculating that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13. Therefore, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nNext, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let's compute that: 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Hmm, 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that: 9000*3 is 27000, 841*3 is 2523, so adding those together: 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, 87000 + 1500 is 88500, 88500 + 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72.\n\nAdding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit large. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar, which might save time and reduce the chance of error.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me define the terms more formally.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So,\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, especially since the recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is given by:\n\na_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c * (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (c=1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works for the first few terms. So, using this formula, I can compute a_9 directly without computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: Let's calculate that. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, 3^10 is 59049. Then, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Good, so the formula is consistent.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524. As calculated earlier, that's 88572.\n\nWait, let me confirm 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 +1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula approach, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, that's another way to compute it, which is perhaps faster and reduces the chance of error.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same answer, which is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing that the expression is a nested set of terms where each term is \\(1 + 3\\) times another similar expression. We can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nDefine each layer as follows:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1}\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2}\\)\n- ...\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 8}\\)\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1.

Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8.

Therefore, we compute:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me denote each expression as E1, E2, E3, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost and E9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, since each expression is 1 + 3*(next expression), maybe I should work backwards. Let me think: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, the next one is 1 + 3*(innermost). Then the next is 1 + 3*(previous one), and so on. So, if I compute each step, starting from the innermost, I can build up the solution. Let me try that. So, starting with the innermost parentheses: Let's call this E1 = 1 + 3. That's simple enough. E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have E2 = 1 + 3*(E1). Since E1 is 4, E2 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so E2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so E2 is 13. Next layer out is E3 = 1 + 3*(E2). E2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Therefore, E3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so E3 is 40. Moving out another layer, E4 = 1 + 3*(E3). E3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Thus, E4 = 1 + 120 = 121. E4 is 121. Next, E5 = 1 + 3*(E4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Therefore, E5 = 1 + 363 = 364. E5 is 364. Continuing outward, E6 = 1 + 3*(E5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E6 is 1093. Next layer, E7 = 1 + 3*(E6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Therefore, E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E7 is 3280. Moving out another layer, E8 = 1 + 3*(E7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Therefore, E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E8 is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer, E9 = 1 + 3*(E8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. E9 is 29524. Wait a second, but the original problem is 3*(E9). Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I have nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), then E1 = 4, E2 = 13, E3 = 40, E4 = 121, E5 = 364, E6 = 1093, E7 = 3280, E8 = 9841, E9 = 29524. But the original problem is 3*(E9). So, the total value is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total value is 88572. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost: 1. (1 + 3) 2. (1 + 3(...)) 3. (1 + 3(...)) ... up to 9 layers? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). Inside that, there are eight more (1 + 3*(...)) expressions, right? Wait, no. Let me see: The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with each inner expression having one less layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then, each layer wraps around with 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I have n layers, the total number of layers is n, starting from the innermost. In this case, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1 + 3*(...) appears. Starting from the innermost: 1. (1 + 3) 2. (1 + 3(...)) 3. (1 + 3(...)) ... Let's see: The innermost is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the first layer is (1 + 3) = 4. The second layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. The third layer is 1 + 3*13 = 40. The fourth layer is 1 + 3*40 = 121. The fifth layer is 1 + 3*121 = 364. The sixth layer is 1 + 3*364 = 1093. The seventh layer is 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. The eighth layer is 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. The ninth layer is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Wait, but let me check the original problem again. It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with each innermost being (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the 3, the first parenthesis is (1 + 3*(...)), then inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: There's one after the first 3, then inside that, another, and so on. Let me see: The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the number of opening parentheses is 9, right? Because each (1 + 3(...)) adds another opening parenthesis. So, that would mean there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous). Therefore, starting from layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. But let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any errors. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 = 360, 3*1 = 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 = 900, 60*3 = 180, 4*3 = 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 = 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let's compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but I just want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first opening parenthesis after the 3, each subsequent layer adds another opening parenthesis. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3(...\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), which is the ninth layer. So, there are nine layers, each adding another 1 + 3*(...). Therefore, the calculation up to layer 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. So, I think my calculation is accurate. But just to be thorough, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let's see. Each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E_n. The recurrence relation is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's expand the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, we have A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is E_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, E_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is E_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: E_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: E_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: E_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, E_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirms our previous result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach backed it up. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer follows the formula E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this for the ninth layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. So, Layer 9 is the outermost part, which is multiplied by 3 at the very end. Let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Alright, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, I see a pattern here, but let me just continue step by step to make sure I don't make any mistakes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to multiply 29524 by 3. Let me do that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, that gives 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me recap to ensure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=13 Layer 3:1+3*13=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572 Yes, that seems correct. Each layer's result was used correctly in the next layer, and the multiplications and additions were done step by step without any errors that I can see. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we work from the innermost parentheses outward:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Yep, that matches. So, the entire expression equals 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did each layer correctly because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one step, which propagates through all the subsequent layers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step to ensure there are no errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again because 3*9841 is 29523, and 29523 + 1 is 29524. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could compute this without having to compute each layer step by step, just to cross-verify.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, let me write down the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let me solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's neat. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with the initial layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds. Therefore, a_9=29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} to ensure that I didn't make a mistake there.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYep, that all checks out. So, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula agree. So, I'm pretty sure that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by computing each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1.

Let's try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, simple enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.

So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Finally, 3*29524=88572, correct. Hmm, all the layers check out. So, I think I did this correctly.

Let me try to compute each layer step by step again to be sure.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here because when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have miscalculated 3*9841. Let me check that again.\n\n3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n\nThere's no more digits, so write down 29. So, 9841*3=29523. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct.\n\nThen, 29524*3: Let me compute it again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I computed Layer 3, I got 40, and then Layer 4 as 121, and so on. Let me check Layer 4 again: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nE_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E_1 = 4.\n\nE_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, E_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: E_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, E_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but if I use the formula, maybe I can compute it more efficiently without computing each layer. Let me see.\n\nSince E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 59049*3=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nTherefore, the expression is (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series might help. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the expression:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIf I let E_9 be the innermost expression, then each layer up to the outermost is built as 1 + 3*E_prev.\n\nBut since we've already found that E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and n=9, then E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer step by step.\n\nBut since I already computed each layer step by step and arrived at the same answer, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*(29524) again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n---------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) *3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's another way to compute it.\n\n30000 *3=90000\n\n476*3=1428\n\nSo, 29524=30000-476\n\nThus, 29524*3=90000 -1428=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as \\( E_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(...) where ... is Layer 1 Layer 3: 1 + 3(...) where ... is Layer 2 And so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one, multiplied by the initial 3. So, let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 result is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 result is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 result is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4 result) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 result is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5 result) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 result is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 result is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 result is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 result is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9 result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the result of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Let me try another way to verify. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is following a pattern similar to 3^n + something. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*next_layer. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so maybe it's a recursive sequence. Let me define a recursive formula. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, starting from a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, a_4=1+3*40=121, a_5=1+3*121=364, a_6=1+3*364=1093, a_7=1+3*1093=3280, a_8=1+3*3280=9841, a_9=1+3*9841=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to derive it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches the earlier result. So, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me go through each layer again to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again. Each time, I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which reminds me of a geometric series or something similar. Maybe there's a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the expression. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9.\n\nWe can define L_n recursively as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, no, L_1 is the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Good.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, and the closed-form formula also leads to the same result. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can compute each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. \n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let's start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is... let me compute that. 1093*3: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, let me verify that because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in my calculations somewhere. Let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3 again: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. Let me break it down differently: 29524*3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4)*3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous one. That recurrence relation might be able to be expressed in a closed-form formula. Let me try to find a general formula for Layer n. The recurrence is: Layer(n) = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Layer(n) = 3*Layer(n-1), which has the solution Layer(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition Layer(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Layer(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Layer(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with Layer 1: n=1, Layer(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
