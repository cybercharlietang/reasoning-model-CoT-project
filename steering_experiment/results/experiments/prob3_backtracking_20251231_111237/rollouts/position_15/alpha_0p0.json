    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, it should be manageable. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That was easy. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's do Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate that: 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, so 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3 again: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, I think my calculation is correct. The final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with Layer 1 as 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is calculated by substituting the previous layer's result into the next expression. After computing all nine layers, the outermost multiplication by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the innermost part of the original expression. Wait, actually, looking back, the innermost part is Layer 9: 1 + 3. Then Layer 8 is 1 + 3(Layer 9), Layer 7 is 1 + 3(Layer 8), and so on, until Layer 1, which is the outermost part. Hmm, maybe I should reverse that. Let me try to write each layer starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), etc., up to Layer 9. Wait, but in the original expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, so that would be Layer 1. Let me confirm: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then, moving outward, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3. Let me break that down: 29000*3 = 87000, and 524*3 = 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which would save time if the expression were longer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, L_1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as before. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. Then, the particular solution would be a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since the innermost layer is n=1, and we have 9 layers, the outermost layer would be n=9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula saved me from computing each layer manually, which is especially useful if the expression had more layers. But since there are only 9 layers, it wasn't too bad to compute each step. However, it's good to know the general approach in case the problem becomes more complex. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series. Let me think about it. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand the entire expression, it might form a geometric series. Let me try expanding the innermost layers first. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. But each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). If I denote each term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., then it's the same as before. But perhaps if I expand the entire expression, I can see a pattern. Let me try expanding a few layers to see if I can find a pattern. Let's consider a smaller version: Suppose I have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) Let's compute that. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, expanding the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, if I write it out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Now, let's see if this can be expressed as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, if I consider the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))). Let's say there are n layers. Then, the value is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))). If I expand this, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) = ... and so on. Ultimately, this would expand to 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3*3^{n}. Wait, let me test that with the smaller example where n=3 layers: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120. If I expand it as 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + 3*3*3*3, that would be 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120. Indeed, that's correct. So, in general, the expression with n layers is equal to the sum from k=1 to k=n+1 of 3^k. Wait, let me see: In the case of n layers, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the previous. So, when expanded, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3^{n+1}. So, the total is the sum of a geometric series from k=1 to k=n+1 of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^{m} - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and m is the number of terms. Here, a=3, r=3, m=n+1. So, S = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. Wait, let me check with the small example where n=3 layers: The sum would be 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120. Plugging into the formula: (3^{3+2} - 3)/2 = (243 - 3)/2 = 240/2 = 120. Correct. So, in general, the expression with n layers is (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. Therefore, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, n=9. Then, the sum S = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, S = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches the earlier result. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. This method is much faster, especially for larger n, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. It's always good to look for patterns and see if a problem can be modeled using known mathematical concepts like geometric series or recurrence relations. In this case, recognizing the pattern allowed me to find a closed-form solution, which is efficient and reduces the chance of calculation errors when dealing with many layers.\n\nAnother way to think about this is by using recursion. The function f(n) representing the value of the expression with n layers can be defined as f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4. This recursive definition directly models the structure of the problem. Using recursion, we can compute each layer based on the previous one, which is essentially what I did step by step earlier. However, recursion can sometimes lead to stack overflow or inefficiency for very large n, but in this case, since n=9, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, using iteration, I can compute each layer from 1 up to 9, updating the value each time. Starting with layer 1 as 4, then computing layer 2 as 1 + 3*layer1, and so on until layer 9. Then, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. This iterative approach is straightforward and avoids the overhead of recursion, especially for larger n.\n\nIn summary, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the closed-form formula derived from the geometric series, or apply recursion or iteration, I arrive at the same result: 88572. It's reassuring to see that different methods lead to the same answer, confirming that the solution is correct.\n\nI might also consider if there's any connection to the number 3 being a base or something, but in this case, it's just a multiplier. The structure of the expression is such that each term is a linear function of the previous one, leading to exponential growth in the values as we move outward from the innermost parentheses. This exponential growth is characteristic of geometric series and explains why the values increase so rapidly with each additional layer.\n\nAdditionally, thinking about the problem in terms of binary trees or nested functions might help visualize the structure, but in this case, the linear approach was sufficient. Each layer is directly dependent on the previous one, forming a linear chain rather than a branching tree.\n\nAnother point to consider is the importance of careful calculation, especially with large numbers. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with numbers like 29524 multiplied by 3, but breaking it down into smaller parts, as I did earlier, helps manage the computation and reduces the chance of mistakes.\n\nIn conclusion, by systematically breaking down the problem, recognizing the pattern, and applying mathematical concepts like geometric series and recurrence relations, I was able to solve the problem efficiently and accurately. This approach not only gives the correct answer but also provides a deeper understanding of how the expression works, which is valuable for more complex problems in the future.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, if I compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2, and so on, I can build up the solution step by step. Let's get started.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple. 1 + 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). We just found Layer 1 is 4, so Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. Therefore, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nNext, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives us 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me compute that: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let's see, 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Let me recompute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. 1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. 1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. 27000+2400=29400, +123=29523. 1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524. Let me check 3*29524 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me this result without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a linear function of the previous one. Maybe this can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let's see.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and then finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nAssume L_p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that works. So, the formula holds for the first few layers. Therefore, I can use this formula to compute any layer without having to compute each one step by step.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Good.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula for L_n, I can write the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, the expression becomes (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer sequentially, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, let's compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That was simple enough. Now, Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with such large numbers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think my answer is right. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helped me manage it without getting lost.

Wait, actually, looking again, the very outermost expression is 3 times (1 + 3(...)), so that would be Layer 9, right? Let me confirm: Each time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on until Layer 9, which is the innermost part of the outermost expression. So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, looking at the original expression: it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, until Layer 9, which is the innermost of the outermost 3*(...). So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, each time plugging the result into the next layer, and finally multiply by 3. That seems like a plan.

Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9.

Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 (since there's no more inside after that) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no. Looking back, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, the outermost is Layer 10: 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way out, computing each layer as I go. Let me try that. Starting with the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Next layer out is Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Next, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Now, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify that multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 4*3 = 12, carryover 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, carryover 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 5*3 = 15, carryover 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9*3 = 27, carryover 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression.

Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3 times (1 + 3(...)). So, if I compute each Layer from 1 to 9, then multiply the last one by 3, I should get the answer. Let me try that approach. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13 gives 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Therefore, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, let's compute 3*29524. Let me break this down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572.

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 That was easy. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3 * Layer 1 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3 * Layer 2 = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*10 is 30, 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, adding 1: 39 + 1 = 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Next, Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3 * Layer 3 = 1 + 3*40.

Hmm, 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 300 + 60 = 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, adding 1: 363 + 1 = 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3 * Layer 5 = 1 + 3*364.

Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step seems correct. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. The computations for each multiplication by 3 and adding 1 seem accurate. For example, Layer 1 was 4, Layer 2 was 13, which is 1 + 3*4. Then Layer 3 was 40, which is 1 + 3*13, and so on.

Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that multiplication. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I do multiplication step by step, I might miscount the carries or the digits.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer was computed step by step, starting from the innermost one, and each time substituting the computed value into the next layer. Finally, multiplying the last layer by 3 gives us the result. I think this makes sense because each layer is a repetition of the same structure, so working from the inside out is the most efficient way.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me quickly recap each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, each step seems to be correct. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe will compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking back, the innermost part is Layer 9, and the outermost is Layer 1. Hmm, maybe I should adjust that. Let me think: the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 3 times the previous layer. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) And then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). That seems right. So, I can compute Layer 1 first, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9, and then multiply by 3 at the end. Let's start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Simple enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: Let's break it down. 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, and 3*1 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with such large numbers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's do it another way to verify. 29524 * 3. 4*3 = 12, carryover 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, carryover 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9*3 = 27, carryover 2. 5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, I think my answer is correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.

Wait, actually, looking back, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4, but then the next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 1).

Let's go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*24=72\n\nWait, that's not the right breakdown. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nSo:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, yes, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this multiplication another way to be sure.

So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me think. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), so it's a geometric series perhaps.\n\nLet me model this. Let me denote the innermost expression as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try to express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers.\n\nLet me expand this step by step. Let's denote the innermost as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the total is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways. Each step checks out, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe can solve this by recognizing a pattern in the nested expressions. Each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}$. We compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. Layer 2: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n3. Layer 3: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n4. Layer 4: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n5. Layer 5: $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364$\n6. Layer 6: $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093$\n7. Layer 7: $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280$\n8. Layer 8: $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841$\n9. Layer 9: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking at the original expression, there are nine layers because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer, and the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Let me confirm that: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that with 1 + 3(...). So, yes, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on until Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, to compute the whole thing, I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward. Let's start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. Therefore, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's do this step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. So, reading it from the top: 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: \n\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when doing multiple steps. Let me verify each layer quickly:\n\n- Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression, which might have a general solution. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, this is a recursive relation. Let's see if we can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which in this case is c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, let me check that. For a linear recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). But in our case, the initial term is a_1 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}. So, it's a first-order linear recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. So, let's see:\n\nGiven a_1 = 4, and a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1} for k >=2.\n\nWe can write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_{k} = 3*a_{k-1}, which is A*3^{k}. The particular solution for the nonhomogeneous part can be found by assuming a constant solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_k = A*3^{k} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this for k=1: a_1 should be 4. Plugging k=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. Using the formula: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. So, the general formula is a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4, and then each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the general formula for the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. \n\nWe recognize that each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We can compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Wait, actually, looking again, the very first term is 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So, the structure is: 3*(Layer 9). So, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each layer seems to be building up. Let me do Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 = 1092. Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279. Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840. Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523. Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the multiplications and additions. Let's verify each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me try computing each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 will be 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13: that's 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, 3*1 is 3. So, 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Well, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.

Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step seems correct. Let me verify a couple of the layers again. For example, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That's correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. Yep, that seems right.

Wait, actually, the expression starts with 3 times (1 + 3(...)), so maybe I should consider each layer as starting with a multiplication by 3. Hmm, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me try to compute each innermost expression first and work my way out. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from the innermost layer). So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that layer gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer). So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so that layer is 40.

Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break that down to make sure I don't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3. Let's compute step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n--------  \n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify this because the numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Maybe I can use another approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me compute this without having to go through each layer manually.\n\nLooking back at the layers, each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost layer, and a_9 is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n from 2 to 9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to compute a_9 without having to calculate each term step by step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence relation: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9 using this formula. a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Good, so that's consistent.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated before. So, that seems to check out.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, maybe the whole expression can be expressed as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, let's think about it. Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, it would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nLet me try to expand this expression step by step, but I'm worried it might get too messy. Alternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as a sum where each term is 3^k, but I need to think carefully about how that would work.\n\nWait, let's see. Each time we have 1 + 3*(...), which can be seen as 1 + 3*previous_expression. So, if I denote E as the entire expression, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to nine layers. But perhaps a better approach is to model it as a recurrence relation, which I've already done.\n\nSince I've already confirmed that a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572, I can be confident that this is the correct answer. However, just to make sure, let me try computing a few more layers using the formula to see if they match my earlier computations.\n\nUsing the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers match the formula, which gives me more confidence in the result.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I've checked it using both step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm pretty sure that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Wait, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Layer 2 equals 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Breaking it down: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplication parts. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. Yeah, all the steps seem to add up correctly. So, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's get started. **Layer 1:** The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. **Layer 2:** Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. **Layer 3:** Next layer out is 1 + 3(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 = 40. **Layer 4:** Now, 1 + 3(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. **Layer 5:** Moving on, 1 + 3(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. **Layer 6:** Next, 1 + 3(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. **Layer 7:** Now, 1 + 3(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. **Layer 8:** Next layer, 1 + 3(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. **Layer 9:** Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we have 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down to make sure I don't make a mistake. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step involved multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. The numbers grew quite rapidly, which makes sense because each layer is essentially tripling the previous result and adding 1, leading to exponential growth. Let me verify a couple of layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake. For example, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I could have used to compute this without calculating each layer. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It's similar to a geometric series, but each term is built upon the previous one. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since I've already computed each term manually, maybe it's not necessary here. However, for future reference, I remember that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} - c/(1 - k). Let me try applying this formula to see if I get the same result. Here, k = 3 and c = 1. So, the formula becomes a_n = (a_1 + 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(1 - 3). Simplifying the denominator: 1 - 3 = -2, so 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. Therefore, a_n = (a_1 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2. Now, a_1 is 4, as computed earlier. Plugging that in: a_n = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2 = (7/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2. Let me compute a_9 using this formula. n = 9, so a_9 = (7/2) * 3^{8} + 1/2. Compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8 = 6561. Therefore, a_9 = (7/2)*6561 + 1/2. Let's compute (7/2)*6561: 7 * 6561 = 45927, then divided by 2: 45927 / 2 = 22963.5. Then, add 1/2: 22963.5 + 0.5 = 22964. Wait, that's different from the 29524 I got earlier. Hmm, that's a problem. It seems like the formula isn't matching my manual calculation. Let me check where I might have gone wrong. Wait, in my initial definition, a_1 = 4, which is correct. But according to the formula, a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} - c/(1 - k). Plugging in c = 1 and k = 3, it's a_n = (a_1 + (1)/(-2)) * 3^{n-1} - (1)/(-2) = (a_1 - 0.5) * 3^{n-1} + 0.5. So, a_9 = (4 - 0.5) * 3^8 + 0.5 = 3.5 * 6561 + 0.5. 3.5 * 6561: Let's compute that. 3 * 6561 = 19683, 0.5 * 6561 = 3280.5. So, 19683 + 3280.5 = 22963.5. Then, adding 0.5 gives 22964. But wait, in my manual calculation, Layer 9 was 29524, which is much larger than 22964. That suggests a discrepancy. Where did I go wrong? Let me check the recurrence relation again. The original expression is built as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Therefore, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, the recurrence is correct. But when I applied the formula, I got a different result. Let me check the formula again. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} - c/(1 - k). Wait, let's test this with n=1: a_1 = 4. Using the formula: a_1 = (4 + 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{0} - 1/(1 - 3) = (4 - 0.5) * 1 + 0.5 = 3.5 + 0.5 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: a_2 = (4 - 0.5)*3^{1} + 0.5 = 3.5*3 + 0.5 = 10.5 + 0.5 = 11. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, a_2 should be 13, but the formula gives 11. That's a problem. So, the formula isn't matching. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in applying the formula. Let me re-examine the formula. The standard formula for a linear recurrence a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is indeed a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} + c/(1 - k). Wait, perhaps I had the sign wrong. Let me derive it correctly. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*k^{n}. The particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = k*B + c => B - k*B = c => B(1 - k) = c => B = c/(1 - k). So, the general solution is a_n = A*k^{n} + B. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*k^{1} + B => A*k + B = 4. We know B = c/(1 - k) = 1/(1 - 3) = -0.5. So, A*3 - 0.5 = 4 => A*3 = 4.5 => A = 1.5. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = 1.5*3^{n} - 0.5. Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = 1.5*3 - 0.5 = 4.5 - 0.5 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = 1.5*9 - 0.5 = 13.5 - 0.5 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = 1.5*27 - 0.5 = 40.5 - 0.5 = 40. Correct. So, the correct formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the correct formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my manual calculation earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I computed before. Therefore, the formula checks out, and my manual calculation was correct. I must have made a mistake earlier when I tried to apply the formula initially, probably misapplying the indices or the constants. But now that I've re-derived it, it makes sense. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the reasoning now. Each step builds upon the previous one correctly, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation. Applying the formula for the recurrence relation confirms the manual calculations. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's begin.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nMoving on to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Calculating 3*4 gives 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13. Therefore, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and adding 1 gives 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Thus, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 equals 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 equals 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we compute 3 * 29524. Let's do that multiplication: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000+27000=87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n8 * 3 = 24, plus 2 carried over is 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, and each time, I computed the value correctly, moving outward. Then, after computing Layer 9, I multiplied it by 3 to get the final result. Each step built upon the previous one, and I double-checked the multiplication for the final step. I think that's solid. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 = let's see, 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let's compute that: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me calculate that: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that: 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step seems correct. Each layer was computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Let me verify a couple of layers to be sure. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. That looks right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. I think I did that correctly. So, the final answer should be 88572. I can also think about whether there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recurrence relation. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that for a second. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps it can be solved using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I also arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since the problem has nine layers. But since I'm just starting out, computing each layer step by step was a good way to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. It's also a way to see how each layer builds upon the previous one, which helps in understanding the structure of the problem. In summary, by either iteratively computing each layer or using the derived formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572. I think I'm confident enough that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, if I compute Layer 1, then Layer 2 using Layer 1, and so on, I should be able to reach the final answer. Let me try that approach. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Hmm, that's 13. Let me write that down. Now, Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, 1080 + 12 = 1092. So, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them: 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 + 9 = 3279. So, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840. So, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Let me verify this multiplication another way. 29524 * 3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's digit-wise multiplication, which might not be the best way.

Let's compute that first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Alright, that's 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, substituting Layer 2's value: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so Layer 3 is 40. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Okay, so Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*(29524). Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me break that down. 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.

But wait, actually, looking back, the expression starts with 3(1 + 3(...)), so each layer is multiplied by 3 after the addition. So maybe I should compute each innermost part first, then substitute it into the next layer, and so on. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So each part multiplied by 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

So, if I compute Layer 1, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on, I can build up the solution step by step. Let's get started. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) We just found that Layer 1 is 4. So, plugging that in: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) Layer 2 is 13. So, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 = 40. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) Layer 3 is 40. So, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) Layer 4 is 121. So, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) Layer 5 is 364. So, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Layer 6 = 1,093. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) Layer 6 is 1,093. So, 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Layer 7 = 3,280. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) Layer 7 is 3,280. So, 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.

Let's calculate that. 29,524 multiplied by 3. Let me do this step by step to avoid mistakes. 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.

Let's start with the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1).

Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Let me try computing each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2: 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40.

Wait, actually, looking again, the outermost layer is 3 times (Layer 9). So, perhaps I should compute Layer 9 first, then Layer 8, and so on until I get to Layer 1. Let me try that approach. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 = 40. Hmm, this is getting bigger each time. Let's go to Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, 3*1=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.

Let me break it down properly. 29524 can be broken into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, 3*4 = 12.

Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*Layer 2. That's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3. So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4. That's 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5. 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6. That's 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*Layer 7. So, 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer 8. That's 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an error when multiplying large numbers. Let me go back through each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Let's compute 3*364 again. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900 + 192=1092. 1092 +1=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. 3000 +279=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. 9000 +840=9840. 9840 +1=9841.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the places.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nMultiplying each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\n5*3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Wait, actually, looking back, the innermost expression is Layer 9, and each layer wraps around the previous one. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost and moving outwards. Let me try that. Let me define each layer step by step. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 is 1 + 3*(L1). Since L1 is 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(...), so after computing L9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9. So, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total expression equals 88,572. Let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure no arithmetic errors. L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39. 1 + 39 is 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120. 1 + 120 is 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363. 1 + 363 is 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192. So, 900 + 192 = 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279. So, 3000 + 279 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524. Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 24*3 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did that correctly. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 (This is the innermost part) Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8), and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Wait, actually, when I look at the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something). So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). Therefore, starting from the innermost layer, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), etc., up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me test this approach with a smaller version of the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. Suppose I have just 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute this step by step. Innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 2) = 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, if I compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Yep, that works. So, applying the same method to the original problem. Since there are nine layers, I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3. Let me list each layer and compute its value.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Hmm, 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to make an error. Let me verify each step again.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 again: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000.\n\n9000*3=27000.\n\n500*3=1500.\n\n24*3=72.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It's 1 + 3(...), and each subsequent term adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nWait, actually, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, until Layer 9. So, the total number of layers is 9, which I accounted for in my calculation. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions, but since the numbers are manageable, computing each layer step by step is feasible. If I were to find a general formula, perhaps I could express it recursively. Let me think about that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nFor n > 1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, each layer is defined recursively based on the previous one. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nSo, using this recursive formula, we can compute each layer step by step, which is exactly what I did earlier. So, my method is consistent with this approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWe can find B by solving the steady-state equation: L = 1 + 3*L => L = 1 + 3L => -2L = 1 => L = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is L_n^p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Wait, actually, when I look again, the innermost part is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me check the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then each time, moving outward, we have another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let me write down each step:\n\n1. Innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. Continue this process until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but in the given problem, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me confirm how many layers there are. Let's count the number of 3s and parentheses. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nI can see that after the initial 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, moving outward, the next is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Then, 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Then: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8.

The problem has 3 followed by nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me recount. Each time I compute a layer, I'm moving one step outward. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me verify each step because it's easy to make a multiplication error. Let's go through each layer again carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that:\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The problem is 3 followed by nine instances of (1 + 3(...)), so that would be nine layers inside, right? So, starting from the innermost, we have nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, yes, nine layers, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier step-by-step calculation. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have just computed each layer step by step, which I did earlier, and arrived at the same result.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first parenthesis after 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...))\n2. Then another (1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nI think there are nine instances of (1+3(...)), so n=9, which gives us a_9 as calculated above.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute each step again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. The expression 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be represented as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. But since it's finite (nine layers), it's a finite geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is finite, the formula we derived using the recurrence relation is more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, whether computing step by step or using the formula, we arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer step by step until reaching the outermost layer. Using the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4, we find that a_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   - Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\n10. **Final Computation:**\n    - Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me try computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Therefore, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nNext, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so it's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so this becomes 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first. 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so this is 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Breaking it down: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so this becomes 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so this is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we have 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. Maybe I can compute it another way. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. 9*3 is 27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 5*3 is 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that matches what I got earlier. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's it. Each step built on the previous one, and by carefully computing each layer, I arrived at the final answer without getting lost in the complexity of the nested parentheses. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially, but since I broke it down step by step, it wasn't too bad. I just had to make sure I computed each multiplication and addition correctly to avoid mistakes. It's easy to get lost in the numbers, especially with such large values, but taking it one layer at a time kept things manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with Layer 1 and proceeding to Layer 9, each layer is computed by substituting the result of the previous layer. Finally, the entire expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me try computing each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 2 is 13.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 (this is the innermost part) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9. Wait, but the problem only has eight closing parentheses after the initial 3(, so maybe there are nine layers in total? Let me check again. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that with another 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer adds another 3*(previous layer). Therefore, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2), etc., up to Layer 9. So, I need to compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2, and so on, until I reach Layer 9, and then multiply that result by 3 to get the final answer. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 364*3 is 1092, so Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: Let me compute that. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so total is 3000+270+9=3279. Therefore, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. So, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so we have 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when numbers get large, it's easy to make an error. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3=6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\nThere's nothing left, so write down the carry over 2.\n\nWait, that would give me 88572, which matches my earlier result. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Let me verify that: 30000*3=90000, 476*3=1428, so 90000 - 1428=88572. Correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. So, to recap, I broke down the expression into layers, starting from the innermost parentheses, computed each layer step by step, and then multiplied the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result. Each step involved multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and adding 1, except for the very first layer, which was just 1 + 3. This methodical approach helped me manage the complexity of the nested expressions without getting overwhelmed. It's interesting how each layer's value grows exponentially because of the multiplication by 3 each time. If I had tried to compute this from the outside in, it might have been more confusing, but working from the inside out made it manageable. I think this is the correct approach and the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer starting from the innermost, we can systematically simplify the expression.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine layers in total, starting from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3. **Compute the Final Result:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the innermost part. Wait, actually, looking again, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then the next layer out is 1 + 3(Layer 1), which would be Layer 2, and so on, until Layer 9 is the outermost expression, which is then multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, let me correct that. The innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3(Layer 2). This continues until Layer 9, which is 1 + 3(Layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, starting from Layer 1, I can compute each layer step by step. Let's write them out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit is the leading 2, which is actually the ten-thousands place. Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when I multiply by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\nTens: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\nHundreds: 5 \u00d73=15 \u21925, carry1.\n\nThousands:9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry2.\n\nTen-thousands:2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me confirm with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 is the same as (29000 + 524) \u00d73 = 29000\u00d73 + 524\u00d73 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572. Let's add them: 87000 + 1500 = 88500, then +72 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So the total is 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Let me just go through each layer again quickly to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1+3\u00d740=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1+3\u00d7121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1+3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1+3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1+3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1+3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3\u00d729524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think that's correct.

Wait, actually, looking again, the innermost expression is Layer 9, and the outermost is Layer 1. Maybe I should label them starting from the innermost as Layer 1 and moving outward. Let me try that. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9. Hmm, that might help. Let me compute Layer 1 first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, 363 + 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Breaking it down: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with such large numbers. Let me verify each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just quickly verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step involved multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. The numbers increased rapidly, which is expected because each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1. After computing each layer, I ended up with 29524 for Layer 9, and then multiplying that by 3 gave me 88572. I don't see any obvious mistakes in the calculations, so I think this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can evaluate it step by step by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"
