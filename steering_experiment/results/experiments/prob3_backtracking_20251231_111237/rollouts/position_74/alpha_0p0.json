Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because that's a lot of steps, and I don't want to have made a mistake in one of the layers which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So yes, all layers are correct, and the final multiplication is correct.

Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3\" before the first closing parenthesis. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, the first is 1+3. Then each next is 1+3( previous ). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of \"1+3(...)\", each nested inside the previous one. So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, which is 1+3, then each previous layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, my earlier computation was correct: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again because sometimes when I do multiplication quickly, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That's another way to verify it. 30000 * 3 = 90000, and 476 * 3 = 1428, so 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That matches, so I'm confident that 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't miss any layers, let me count the number of opening parentheses again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3)\n\nSo, nine layers, each adding another 3(...). So, yes, my computation was correct with nine layers, ending up with Layer 9 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. If there were more layers, maybe a formula would be better, but here, step-by-step computation is feasible.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that we have nine layers, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution confirms our previous result. It's reassuring to see that both approaches lead to the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is essentially building a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nEach a_n can be expressed as a geometric series:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))\n\nWhich is similar to summing a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nBut since the number of terms is finite (nine layers), it's a finite geometric series.\n\nThe formula for the sum of a finite geometric series is S_n = (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nWait, but in our case, the series is built differently. Each term is 1, then 3*1, then 3^2*1, etc., but it's nested, so it's more like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric progression but with a multiplier each time.\n\nAlternatively, since we've already derived the closed-form solution as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we can use that to find a_9 directly, which we did.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result. This consistency gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure of the expression.\n2. Start computing from the innermost parentheses and work outward.\n3. For each layer, compute the value based on the previous layer's result.\n4. After computing the innermost nine layers, multiply the outermost result by 3.\n5. Verify the computations step by step to ensure accuracy.\n6. As an additional check, model the problem using a recurrence relation and derive a closed-form solution to confirm the result.\n\nThis systematic approach helps prevent mistakes and ensures that each part of the expression is evaluated correctly. It's easy to get lost in the parentheses, but taking it one step at a time makes it manageable.\n\nI also thought about whether there's a pattern or formula that could simplify the computation, especially if the number of layers were larger. In this case, since there are only nine layers, manually computing each one wasn't too bad. But for more layers, using the recurrence relation or recognizing the geometric series would be more efficient.\n\nIn summary, by carefully breaking down the problem, computing each layer step by step, and verifying my work with an alternative method, I arrived at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way up. Finally, we multiply the result by 3. \n\nHere are the key steps:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Now, let's find another equation. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. To find B, we can set L_n = B, then substitute into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, plug B back into the first equation: 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have Layer 9, let's compute L9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. It's a bit tedious with all the layers, but breaking it down step by step worked well. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence and solving it with the formula made it quicker for the later layers. Either way, the result is the same. I think that's about it. I can't think of any other way to approach this problem, so I'll stick with 88572 as the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me recount: The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let's count the number of innermost \"1+3\" expressions. Starting from the innermost: 1+3. Then each layer adds another 1+3(...).

    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer, perhaps it's a geometric series or follows a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 59049*3 = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've got this. It was a bit tedious computing each layer manually, but using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula helped confirm the answer. So, the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if this forms a geometric series or something. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, the pattern is that each L_n is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try that. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute 3*29524: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

Wait, but let me cross-verify my earlier computations because 3*(Layer 9) is 3*29524=88572. But let me check if I computed each layer correctly. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

So, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. It looks like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Wait, let's see. Each a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, starting from a_1=4, and building up. But I think the approach I took using the recurrence relation is sufficient.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute a few more layers using the formula to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the final computation is 3*29524=88572. Let me just check that multiplication again to be absolutely sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but in this case, since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's more of a linear recurrence. But I think the method I used is solid.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Recognize that the expression is a nested set of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n2. Start computing from the innermost parentheses, moving outward layer by layer.\n3. Notice the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4.\n4. Solve the recurrence to find a closed-form formula, which gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n5. Compute a_9 using this formula, which gives 29524.\n6. Multiply by 3 to get the final result, 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost.

Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.

That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given that each term is 1 + 3*previous term, it's actually a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it that way. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >1. We can compute a_n using this recurrence. Let me compute the terms up to a_9. a1=4 a2=1 +3*a1=1+12=13 a3=1 +3*a2=1+39=40 a4=1 +3*a3=1+120=121 a5=1 +3*a4=1+363=364 a6=1 +3*a5=1+1092=1093 a7=1 +3*a6=1+3279=3280 a8=1 +3*a7=1+9840=9841 a9=1 +3*a8=1+29523=29524 So, that's the same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, is there a formula for such a recurrence? Let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P =1 => -2P=1 => P= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general form for such a recurrence is L_n = a*r^{n} + b, where a and b are constants. Let's assume L_n = a*3^{n} + b. Let's plug into the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(a*3^{n-1} + b) = 1 + a*3^{n} + 3b. But L_n is also a*3^{n} + b. So, setting equal: a*3^{n} + b = 1 + a*3^{n} + 3b. Subtract a*3^{n} from both sides: b = 1 + 3b. Subtract 3b from both sides: -2b = 1 => b = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = a*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find a. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = a*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3a - 1/2 => 3a = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => a = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3^{11}/2 - 3/2, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to see it. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think I've got it right. Let me just recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step, I found that the innermost layers compute to 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, and finally 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. I also verified using a recurrence relation and found a closed-form formula, which gave the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's see: Wait, actually, in our earlier calculation, we had Layer 1 up to Layer 9, but the initial condition was a_1 = 4. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each a_n is the nth layer. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think about solving the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A and C are constants. To find C, we can solve for the steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = C. So, C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

So, I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me denote L_k as the value of the kth layer, where k=1 is the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nI wonder if there's a pattern or a closed-form formula for L_k. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the first few terms:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 13\n\nL_3 = 40\n\nL_4 = 121\n\nL_5 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 29524\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers, I notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me check:\n\nL_2 = 3*L_1 + 1 = 3*4 +1 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL_3 = 3*L_2 +1=3*13 +1=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL_4=3*L_3 +1=3*40 +1=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, so the recursive formula is L_k = 3*L_{k-1} +1, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B =4\n\nAlso, since the recurrence is L_k = 3*L_{k-1} +1, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k, and the particular solution is a constant B.\n\nTo find B, set L_k = B:\n\nB = 3*B +1 => B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2\n\nNow, plug B back into the first equation:\n\n3A + (-1/2) =4 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k -1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{k+1} -1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the initial terms.\n\nFor k=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works.

Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, then each layer can be expressed recursively. Maybe I can find a general formula for Ln in terms of L(n-1). So, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that approach. Given the recurrence relation: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L9 = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, L9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same answer. That makes me confident that 88572 is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on, up to L9. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's try to see the pattern. Let me write down the values again: L1 = 4 L2 = 13 L3 = 40 L4 = 121 L5 = 364 L6 = 1093 L7 = 3280 L8 = 9841 L9 = 29524 Hmm, let's see if these numbers follow a pattern. Let's see the ratio between consecutive terms: L2 / L1 = 13 / 4 = 3.25 L3 / L2 = 40 /13 \u2248 3.0769 L4 / L3 = 121 /40 = 3.025 L5 / L4 = 364 /121 \u2248 3.00826 L6 / L5 = 1093 /364 \u2248 3.0000 L7 / L6 = 3280 /1093 \u2248 3.0000 L8 / L7 = 9841 /3280 \u2248 3.0000 L9 / L8 = 29524 /9841 \u2248 3.0000 So, as we go further, the ratio approaches 3. That makes sense because each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), which can be approximated as 3*(previous term) for large n. So, for large n, Ln \u2248 3*Ln-1, which is a geometric sequence with ratio 3. However, since each term is actually 1 + 3*Ln-1, the exact value is slightly more than 3*Ln-1. So, perhaps we can model this as a recurrence relation and solve it. Let me try that. The recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = Ln^h + Ln^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the earlier values. For n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, L9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*(L9)=3*((3^10 -1)/2)= (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

But let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you're doing a lot of layers, it's easy to make an error. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is like a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to get the answer using the closed-form formula, which might be more efficient for larger numbers of layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me try computing a couple more layers using the formula to see if I didn't make a mistake earlier. For example, Layer 4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches what I had before. So, that's correct. Layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula is solid. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me write down the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.

Solving this recurrence, we find that each layer \\( a_n \\) can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).

Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13 Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n represent the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, which would allow me to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the initial layers: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the general formula gives me the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've approached this correctly, breaking it down step by step and verifying with a general formula. It might have been time-consuming to compute each layer manually, but using the recurrence relation helped confirm that the result is accurate. So, yeah, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364.

But let me check each step again because sometimes when you compute so many layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make this computation faster. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That recurrence relation might have a closed-form solution. Let's see: Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = a*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*a^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (b=1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = a*L_p + b. Solving for L_p: L_p - a*L_p = b => L_p*(1 - a) = b => L_p = b/(1 - a). In our case, a=3, b=1, so L_p = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer 9, L(9)= (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step. That might have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since there were only nine layers, it wasn't too bad. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. If we expand the expression, starting from the innermost parentheses: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the expression is essentially 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. The formula we derived earlier is a form of a geometric series sum. Let me recall that a geometric series sum S = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^(n-1) = a*(r^n -1)/(r -1). In our case, the recurrence led us to the same formula because each layer adds another power of 3. So, using the closed-form solution was more efficient. However, since I was able to compute each layer step by step without error, I'm confident that the final answer is correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Compute the innermost layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Work outward layer by layer:**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of expression because it's a repeated multiplication and addition. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be modeled with recursion. Let me think. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Plugging in the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, we have: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13.

Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.

The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. In this case, a=3, b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition. Wait, actually, the standard solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n}*(L_0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, perhaps I should re-derive it. Let me see. Let's write the recurrence as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, but in our case, L_1 = 4. Let's check: At n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula holds. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, step-by-step computation is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying initial conditions. Let's say n=1 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and formula, I arrive at the same result.

Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if I can find a formula for this kind of recursive expression. It seems like a geometric series or something. Let me think. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then a_2 =1 +3*a1=1 +12=13. a3=1 +3*a2=1 +39=40. And so on, up to a9. So, the general formula is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a1=4. The standard solution for such a recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a1=4. So, when n=1, a1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2)=3A -1/2. Therefore, 4 +1/2 =3A => 9/2=3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a9, which is the outermost layer, n=9. So, a9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something. Let me see if I can find a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, just to confirm. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. We have L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for L(n) = a + b*L(n-1) is L(n) = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + c, where c is a constant. Wait, let me think. The recurrence relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). The homogeneous solution would be L(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. So yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I could have computed 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the geometric series. But since the problem didn't specify a particular method, just to compute it, either way is fine. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step expansion and the formula using the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result. So I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Compute the innermost parentheses:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Work outward layer by layer:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, it's 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be faster or confirm my answer. Let's see, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute a few layers using the formula and see if they match my earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works for the first few layers, which gives me more confidence that my answer is correct. So, yeah, I think I did this right. It was a bit tedious computing each layer, but using the formula helped verify the result. So, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so perhaps it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is our Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it using the closed-form formula. Either way, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form solution. The innermost expression is computed first, and each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one.

    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Wait, but let me check again because when I did 29524 * 3, I thought 29524 is 29,524, so 29,524 * 3 is indeed 88,572. Alternatively, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, so 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That confirms it. So, the final result is 88,572.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but in a nested form. Alternatively, perhaps each layer can be represented recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3. f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1). f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2). And so on, up to f(9). Then, the total expression is 3*f(9). Let me compute f(n) for n from 1 to 9. f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121. f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364. f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. f(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. f(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. f(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, this confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, is there a pattern or a formula that can compute f(n) without having to compute each layer? Let me think. Each f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1. The homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume f_p(n) = C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 =88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*f(n) = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that's 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yes, that's another way to compute it directly without going through each layer. So, that confirms the answer again. Therefore, the computed value is 88,572.

So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can see this as a geometric series. Each a_n is built by multiplying the previous term by 3 and adding 1. So, expanding the expression, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). This can be represented as a sum: 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^k. Wait, but in our case, the expression is a bit different because each term is 1 + 3*(...). So, actually, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric series but with a twist. However, since we've already derived the formula for a_n, and it's correct, we can proceed confidently. So, to recap, the problem required computing a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, we arrived at the final result of 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation method gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:  \n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression using the formula. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

The final computation yields 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if there are many layers. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. That reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say a_n represents the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. To solve this recurrence relation, I can use the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the value before multiplying by 3 is 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation formula. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem using both methods and see if they match. Let's say, for example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, that's three layers instead of nine. Let me compute this manually:\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOutermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nUsing the formula: a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Then, 3*a_3 = 3*40 = 120. Perfect, both methods give the same result. So, the formula works. Therefore, applying it to the original problem, which has nine layers, gives a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, and then 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each consisting of 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the calculations. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in computing the layers. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since the problem is quite nested with nine layers. Maybe I can find a recursive formula or recognize a geometric series. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, it's essentially 3*a_9 where a_9 is as computed. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's not the correct way to break it down. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Correct. Alternatively, using the standard multiplication method: 29524\nx      3\n----------\nMultiply each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after all that, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, we can simplify the calculation. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), leading to a formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this for the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\) the previous term.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let's find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4.5 => A=1.5. So a_n = 1.5*3^n - 0.5. Simplifying, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that confirms the earlier result.

Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n...\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nI can try to find a general formula for L_n. Let's see if this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me write out the first few terms:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n...\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous part: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. Let's take n=1: L1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L9, n=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after verifying using both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough.

The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer one by one:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."
