    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the recurrence pattern, we can derive a formula to find the solution efficiently. \n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

For n=9:\n   - a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524\n   - Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me recount each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in computation. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the equation: C = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the result. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this using another approach, like recognizing it as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, it might resemble a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me try expanding it step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let me denote the innermost as E1 =1 +3. Then E2 =1 +3*(E1) =1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13. E3=1 +3*(E2)=1 +3*13=1 +39=40. E4=1 +3*40=1 +120=121. E5=1 +3*121=1 +363=364. E6=1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. E7=1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. E8=1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. E9=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572. So, same result. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a sum. Let me think: The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3s and 1s. Each layer adds a 1 and a 3 multiplied by the next layer. Since there are nine layers, each with a 1 and a 3, except the innermost which is just 1 +3. Wait, but when expanded, it's going to be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) which can be represented as 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} where n is the number of layers. Wait, but let me test this. Let's see, when I have E1=1+3=4=3+1. E2=1 +3*E1=1 +3*(3 +1)=1 +9 +3=13=3^2 +3 +1. E3=1 +3*E2=1 +3*(9 +3 +1)=1 +27 +9 +3=40=3^3 +3^2 +3 +1. So, each E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but in our case, E1=4=3 +1= sum_{k=0}^1 3^k. E2=13= sum_{k=0}^2 3^k + something? Wait, no, E2=13=3^2 +3 +1=13. Similarly, E3=3^3 +3^2 +3 +1=40. So, E_n= sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but sum_{k=0}^n 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier. So, E_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, E9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572. So, this is consistent with the previous methods. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression without breaking it into layers, it's a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by coefficients. Let me try expanding it all the way. Let me write the expression step by step: Starting from the innermost: 1 +3=4. Then, moving out: 1 +3*4=13. Next:1 +3*13=40. Then:1 +3*40=121. Then:1 +3*121=364. Then:1 +3*364=1093. Then:1 +3*1093=3280. Then:1 +3*3280=9841. Then:1 +3*9841=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. So, same result again. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. To make sure, perhaps I can compute it using another method, like recognizing it as a geometric series. The expression, when fully expanded, is a sum of powers of 3. Let me see: Let me denote the innermost as S1=1+3. Then S2=1 +3*(S1)=1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13. S3=1 +3*S2=1 +3*13=1 +39=40=1 +3 +9 +27=40. Wait, 1 +3 +9 +27=40? Let's see:1 +3=4, +9=13, +27=40. Yes. So, S3=1 +3 +9 +27=40. Similarly, S4=1 +3*S3=1 +3*40=1 +120=121=1 +3 +9 +27 +81=121. Indeed, 1+3=4, +9=13, +27=40, +81=121. So, each S_n is the sum of the geometric series up to 3^{n}. Therefore, S_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, S9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*S9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think I've checked it thoroughly enough. I don't see any mistakes in my computations, and multiple methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be modeled using a geometric series. The final result is computed by recognizing the pattern and applying the formula for the sum of a geometric series. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). This forms a geometric series with a common ratio of 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Geometric Series Formula:**\n   The nth layer can be expressed as \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For Layer 9 (\\(n=9\\)):\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without expanding each layer, which would be faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) =88572, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute this without expanding each layer, which is much more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers.\n\nIn conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

Applying this formula up to layer 9 and then multiplying by 3, we find the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms, each being 1 + 3 times another similar expression, repeated 9 times.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**: Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4), compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result into the next layer's formula.\n\n3. **Derive the formula**: Recognize the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} and solve it to find a general formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Apply the formula**: For n=9, compute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times a_9, resulting in 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4=13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc. So, it's a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.

The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 =4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 =8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check again the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, each time we have one more layer. Let me count: The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another layer. The expression is 3*(...), where inside there are 8 more layers of 1 + 3*(...). Wait, let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, from the innermost, we have 9 layers, right? Because each time you go out a layer, you add another 1+3*(...). Wait, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The initial expression is 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...). So that's the first layer inside. Then, inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" in the expression. Let me write it out:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n4. 1 + 3*(...)\n5. 1 + 3*(...)\n6. 1 + 3*(...)\n7. 1 + 3*(...)\n8. 1 + 3*(...)\n9. 1 + 3*(...)\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost. So, a_1 is the innermost, a_2 is the next, up to a_9, which is the outermost before the initial 3. So, the total expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, then 3*a_9=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers manually to see if the pattern holds. For example, let's compute a_4 using the formula: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches what I got earlier. Similarly, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold, so I can trust that a_9 is indeed 29524, leading to the final answer of 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a recursive pattern where each layer is of the form $a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we find that the outermost layer before the initial multiplication by 3 is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is defined as $a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n   - Layer 2: $1 + 3(4) = 13$\n   - Layer 3: $1 + 3(13) = 40$\n   - Layer 4: $1 + 3(40) = 121$\n   - Layer 5: $1 + 3(121) = 364$\n   - Layer 6: $1 + 3(364) = 1093$\n   - Layer 7: $1 + 3(1093) = 3280$\n   - Layer 8: $1 + 3(3280) = 9841$\n   - Layer 9: $1 + 3(9841) = 29524$\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:** Using the closed-form formula $a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$, we confirm that Layer 9 is 29524.\n\n4. **Final Multiplication:** Multiply Layer 9 by 3: $3 \\times 29524 = 88572$.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go back and verify each layer. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here, instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a general formula for the nth layer. Let me think about that. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let's see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I let x be the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3, but actually, each layer adds another 3*(...). Wait, perhaps it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to expand the entire expression step by step. The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4. Then Layer 2:1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40. Layer 4:1 +3*40=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, using the formula I derived, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, 3*L_9=88572. So, either way, the answer is the same. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this. Let me denote the innermost expression as a1 = 1 + 3. Then, a2 = 1 + 3a1, a3 = 1 + 3a2, and so on, up to a9. Then, the entire expression is 3a9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a1 = 4. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. From the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. So, substituting the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a1 = 4. So, when n=1: a1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern where a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since there are nine layers, n=9, so a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. This seems more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger, but for nine layers, either method works. It's good to know both approaches: the step-by-step expansion and the general formula for the recurrence relation. So, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers.

The recurrence relation is:\n   - a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\n   - Initial condition: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**:\n   - The general solution for a_n is found to be a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute a_9**:\n   - a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**:\n   - The entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me double-check one of the layers to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error. Let's check Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 29524*3=88572. So, I think I did each step correctly.

The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(previous). I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Let me confirm if each layer was correctly computed. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute it without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something that can be expressed in a closed-form formula. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Each term is multiplied by 3 each time, so the entire expression can be seen as a sum of a geometric series. But in this case, since each layer is nested, it's more straightforward to model it as a recurrence relation, which we did. So, in summary, by either iteratively computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, we arrive at the same result. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$.

So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. Each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I found earlier. Then, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute the expression step by step again, but this time, perhaps in a different way, to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Let me compute each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression by expanding it, but that might be too cumbersome given the depth of nesting. Alternatively, I can consider that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, as I found earlier, the closed-form is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, that's another way to confirm it. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each 1+3(...) adds a layer. So, from the innermost to outermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me recount the layers. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: The first 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent 1+3 wraps around that. Let's see: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, to save time and reduce errors. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, but using the formula is more efficient. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step. Alternatively, noticing that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can model it as such. Let me consider the general form. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Alternatively, I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be represented using a geometric series or recursion. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe to verify my answer. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute the terms up to a_9: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's consistent with what I did before. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've checked it thoroughly using two methods: step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation. Both methods led me to the same result, so I don't think I made a mistake. It's always good to verify, especially when dealing with multiple layers of nested expressions.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a formula for a_n without computing each layer step by step. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D = 1 + 3D => 0 = 1 + 2D => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=59049*3=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me more confidence that it's correct. Therefore, I think the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the outermost expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me just double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire original expression in terms of the closed-form formula, it's 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. So that's another way to compute it directly, without going through each layer. That's pretty cool! It's interesting how recognizing the pattern allows for a much more efficient calculation. So, in summary, by either computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result: 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same number, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

But wait, let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each next one adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers: 1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nWait, actually, the original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...), starting from the innermost as 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. So, yes, 29524 is Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think: This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me see: Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9. Because the expression is 3*(a_9). So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this without using the closed-form formula, but just by recognizing the pattern. Each time, the value is 1 + 3*(previous value). So, starting from 4, each step is 1 + 3*previous. So, as I did before, computing each layer step by step, I end up with 29524 for the innermost layer, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors when multiplying 29524 by 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think I've arrived at the correct solution by computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. Using the recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, this gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous computations.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent each time. So, each layer builds upon the previous one correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. That reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Let's model it mathematically.\n\nLet me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a_n represents the value of the nth layer. So, starting from the innermost layer as a_1, then a_2 is the next layer, and so on up to a_9. The relationship between each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence relation: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works. So, the 9th layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. This method using the recurrence relation confirms the step-by-step computation. It's reassuring to see that both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer up to the ninth. Finally, we multiply the ninth layer by 3 to get the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term.

Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9000 = 58524, 58524 + 500 = 59024, 59024 + 24 = 59048.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if the method works. Let's say, for example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this using the same method. Innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Which matches. So, the method works for a smaller case. Therefore, I can be confident that the same method applies to the larger problem.

But wait, let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer wraps around. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the innermost. Then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the first innermost is layer 1: 1+3. Then layer 2 is 1+3*(layer1). Layer3: 1+3*(layer2). And so on, until layer9: 1+3*(layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, yes, 9 layers, each computed step by step as I did before. Therefore, the final result after multiplying by 3 is 88572. Hmm, but let me check if perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the opening parentheses: Starting from the first 3, then each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.

So, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so 9 layers in total, each computed as I did before. So, the innermost is layer1:1+3=4, then layer2:1+3*4=13, and so on up to layer9:29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I think my calculation is correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. Now, multiplying layer9 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this again:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). But in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar but with c=1 and k=3.\n\nWait, let me write the recurrence properly. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, for n=1, a1=4. For n=2, a2=1 + 3*4=13. For n=3, a3=1 + 3*13=40, etc., which matches our earlier calculations.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation of layer9=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula confirms our step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is effectively a geometric series. Let me see: Starting from the innermost layer, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, expanding the entire expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's expand this step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nAnd so on, as before.\n\nBut using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n=9, gives a9=29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Looking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging in the initial condition: When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, for the recurrence relation, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. To find B, we can consider the steady-state solution where L_n = L_{n-1} = B.\n\nThen, B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation: 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is built upon the previous one, with each term being 3 times the previous plus 1. So, expanding the entire expression might reveal a geometric progression.\n\nLet me try expanding the entire expression step by step, just to see if it aligns with the previous results. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nExpression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's denote the innermost part as E1: E1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\nThen, moving out, E2 =1 + 3*E1 =1 + 3*4=13\n\nE3=1 +3*E2=1 +3*13=40\n\nE4=1 +3*E3=1 +3*40=121\n\nE5=1 +3*E4=1 +3*121=364\n\nE6=1 +3*E5=1 +3*364=1093\n\nE7=1 +3*E6=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nE8=1 +3*E7=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nE9=1 +3*E8=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, regardless of the method\u2014whether using the recurrence relation, the closed-form formula, or directly expanding each layer\u2014the result is consistent. This makes me confident that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've explored this problem thoroughly, checked my work using different approaches, and each time arrived at the same conclusion. So, I feel certain that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer's value is calculated step by step. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a closed-form formula, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check one or two layers to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's check Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13=39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me do that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6. Adding the carries: 2 (from 12), carry 1. 6 +1=7, carry 0. 5, carry 1. 28, carry 2. 8. So yes, 88572. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the correct breakdown because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. But just to be thorough, let me check if there's a pattern in the layers. Let's see the results for each layer: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Hmm, looking at these numbers, I notice that each layer is roughly multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We know that L_1 = 4, so 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, let's compute L_2: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Plugging into the general solution: L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4, and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Then, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(1.5) + B = 4 => 4.5 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 4.5 = -0.5. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 0.5 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the known layers: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, L_9 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a few layers again to check. Let me recompute Layers 7, 8, 9. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 +9= 3279. Then, 1 + 3279= 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. Wait, 3280 is 3000 + 200 + 80 +0. So 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. Adding up: 9000 + 600=9600, +240=9840, +0=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: As above, 29524*3=88572. So, I think my computations are correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps, using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is when we set a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Then, 59048 /2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did earlier, and it would have taken a bit more time but still led me to the same answer. I think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524=88572. So, yes, each step checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me go through each layer again just to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct.

Correct. Then 3*29524=88,572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. a_3 =1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40. And so on. So in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. If I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might make it easier instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2)=3C -1/2. So 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since our problem has 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result. It's always good to verify using two different methods to ensure that the answer is correct. So, just to recap: The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step or using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrived at the result of 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but let me just do a quick sanity check. If each layer roughly triples the previous value, then the numbers should be growing exponentially. Starting from 4, each layer is about three times the previous, so after nine layers, it's 3^9 times the initial value. 3^9 is 19,683, but since each layer adds 1, the actual growth is a bit more. But 88,572 is 3*29,524, and 29,524 is indeed (3^10 -1)/2, which is correct. So, yeah, I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe we can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(a_9). Since a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form expression. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5:1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can check if there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, but let me check my computations again because when I did the layers, I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't miscalculate. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without manually calculating each layer, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n = 3*a_{n-1}. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 = a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute this without having to manually calculate each layer, which is helpful if the number of layers increases. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
