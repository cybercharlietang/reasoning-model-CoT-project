Wait, but let me check my earlier layers because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer step by step again to make sure I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time, especially if there are many layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B =4. For n=0, if we consider L_0, but in our case, n starts at 1. Alternatively, maybe we can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is L_n^(h) = C*3^n. A particular solution would be a constant, say L_n^(p) = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D -3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is multiplied by 3, so the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). It's a bit tricky because it's a nested structure, but perhaps using the closed-form formula is the easiest way. Alternatively, let's try expanding the expression step by step, just to be thorough.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the same answer.

So starting from the innermost: Layer1: 4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1=1+3=4, L2=1+3*L1, L3=1+3*L2, etc., up to L9. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. That's a recursive formula. So, maybe I can find a closed-form expression for Ln. Let's see, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1. Wait, actually, it's Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. Let me rearrange it: Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9=(3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring.

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is a linear recurrence. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recurrence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3a_p = 1 => -2a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed layers. For Layer 1, n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. Layer 2, n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. Layer3, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer9 is when n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I wanted to write the entire expression in terms of exponents, I could note that each layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (3^{11}-3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using the formula, we can get the answer directly without computing each layer step by step. That might have been more efficient, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad. But it's good to know the general formula in case we have more layers in the future. So, in summary, the steps are: 1. Recognize the nested structure and compute each layer from the inside out. 2. Alternatively, use the recursive formula and solve it using the closed-form expression for the recurrence relation. 3. Multiply the final layer result by 3 to get the overall result. Both methods lead to the same answer, which is 88572. I think I'm confident with this solution. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer.

    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Let me check if that makes sense by looking back at the layers. So, each layer was computed correctly, and then multiplied by 3. Let me just recheck the layers quickly. Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=13 Layer3:1+3*13=40 Layer4:1+3*40=121 Layer5:1+3*121=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=29524 Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. This is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth term. Let's denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's consider the recurrence relation: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's find A and B. At n=1, L1=4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. At n=2, L2=13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check for n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for n=9, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using the recurrence relation and a derived formula, we confirm that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer follows a pattern leading to the ninth layer being 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

So yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here, recognizing that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. If we denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the linear recurrence. That's reassuring because it confirms the result I got by computing each layer step by step. So, whether I compute each layer manually or use the formula from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression.

But wait, let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let's go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive expression. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different approaches (iterative computation and using the recurrence relation) both lead to the same result. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering how many layers there are, each multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it might add up. Let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series or something similar? Let me consider each layer as a term in a sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I had noticed the pattern earlier, I could have used the closed-form formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer step by step. That would have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since I only had nine layers, it wasn't too bad to compute each step manually. It's also a good way to verify that the closed-form solution works correctly. So, in summary, by recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrived at the same result as computing each layer step by step. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is defined as 1 plus three times the next nested term. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. Using the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, we confirm that the result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.

The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me check that. Let's assume L_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence relation: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's expand the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, so B is -1/2. Then, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1 into L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. So, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 =3 *29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I use the formula for L_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer manually or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. I think that solidifies the conclusion. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, then 1 +29523 is 29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to verify the result without computing each layer manually. Let's think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\nL2=1 +3*L1=1+12=13\n\nL3=1 +3*L2=1+39=40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet me define L_n as the value of the nth layer.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\nL2=1 +3*L1=1 +3*4=13\n\nL3=1 +3*L2=1 +3*13=40\n\nL4=1 +3*L3=1 +3*40=121\n\nAnd so on up to L9.\n\nSo, the recurrence is L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as L_n -3*L_{n-1}=1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n -3*L_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K -3*K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nIf L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=1, L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, this formula works. So, L9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to see if it's 59049.\n\nYes, 3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049.

Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let's see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but perhaps for a small number of terms, it's easier to compute each step as I did before. However, since there are nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is 3^n - 2, but let me check that.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLet me test for n=1: a1=1+3=4. If n=1, 3^1 - 2=3-2=1, which is not 4. So that formula doesn't hold.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let's see the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but more accurately, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found. Let's try solving the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_h = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = a_h + a_p = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this for n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is Layer 1, n=1, a1=4. Then, each subsequent layer increments n by 1.\n\nSo, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9.\n\nThus, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a9, which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, we can compute the value step by step or apply a formula derived from the recurrence relation.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I remember that sometimes when you have a nested expression like this, there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Maybe I can find a pattern or a recursive formula here. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation for the homogeneous part would be r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = homogeneous solution + particular solution = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524. Then, the original expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, 3*a_9=3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach gave me the same result.

So the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Alternatively, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that can express L_n in terms of n. Let me see if each term can be represented as a function of n. Let me try to find a recurrence relation. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works! So, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have nine layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 *29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 88,572. Therefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, we find the value at each layer and ultimately compute the entire expression.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. Starting from the innermost parentheses, we compute each layer step by step.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:**\n   Recognizing the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}\\) with \\(L_1 = 4\\), the solution is \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, it's a recursive sequence. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recursion is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 =4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but let me just recap to make sure. Each layer is computed correctly, starting from the innermost, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. The formula confirms that each layer a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which for n=9 gives 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Yep, that seems solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recursive approach or a formula derived from the linear recurrence relation, we find that each layer a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So Layer 2: 1 + 12=13, Layer3:1 +39=40, Layer4:1 +120=121, Layer5:1 +363=364, Layer6:1 +1092=1093, Layer7:1 +3279=3280, Layer8:1 +9840=9841, Layer9:1 +29523=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))), it's a geometric series. In this case, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting with x\u2080 = 1 + 3, then x\u2081 = 1 + 3x\u2080, x\u2082 = 1 + 3x\u2081, and so on up to x\u2088. Since there are nine layers, the outermost is x\u2088, and then the entire expression is 3*x\u2088. So, in general, each x\u2099 = 1 + 3x\u2099\u208b\u2081. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for x\u2099. Let's see. The recurrence is x\u2099 = 3x\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1, with x\u2080 = 4. The homogeneous solution is x\u2099^h = A*3\u207f. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume x\u2099^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is x\u2099 = A*3\u207f - 1/2. Using the initial condition x\u2080 = 4: 4 = A*3\u2070 - 1/2 => 4 = A - 1/2 => A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, x\u2099 = (9/2)*3\u207f - 1/2. Simplifying, x\u2099 = (9*3\u207f - 1)/2. So for n = 8 (since we have nine layers, starting from x\u2080 to x\u2088), x\u2088 = (9*3\u2078 - 1)/2. Let's compute 3\u2078: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So x\u2088 = (9*6561 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then the entire expression is 3*x\u2088 = 3*29524 = 88572. So both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

Starting from the innermost layer: Layer1: 1+3=4. Layer2: 1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition to find A and B. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=0: Wait, but if n=0 is not defined here because the innermost layer is n=1. Alternatively, maybe it's better to solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of powers of 3. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. But actually, since each layer is defined as 1 + 3*previous_layer, starting from 1 + 3, I think the closed-form approach is better here. Since I found that each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and all methods lead to the same result.

    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. But let me think again. Is there a pattern here? Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can see that each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Let me see if there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3(a_{n-1} + c). Let me see, but maybe it's easier to notice the pattern. Let's compute a few terms: a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. Hmm, looking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1. Wait, but in our case, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, which is the same as 3a_{n-1} +1. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} +1, with a1=4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The standard solution for such a linear recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3C +1 => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a1=4. When n=1: a1= A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 =4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2= (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a9, which is the 9th layer, n=9: a9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For example, a1= (3^2 -1)/2=4, correct. a2=(3^3 -1)/2=13, correct. a3=(3^4 -1)/2=40, correct. a4=(3^5 -1)/2=121, correct. a5=(3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct. a6=(3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct. a7=(3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct. a8=(3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct. a9=(3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct. So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the process. So, the problem is solved.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\).

Let's go through each layer step by step again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. It seems like each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's a more efficient way to compute it without having to go through each layer step by step. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern and solving the recurrence relation can make the problem much easier. But since I didn't think of that initially, I just went step by step, which worked too, albeit a bit more time-consuming. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer, leading to a geometric progression. By solving the recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be represented as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this for the outermost layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from the inside: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct.

Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me some time. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, in general, each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1: a_1=4. Then, each subsequent layer up to layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). Let me compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe given expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1.

    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final result is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=1+3=4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, then plug in n=9 and multiply by 3. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's check for n=1: a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.

Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about whether there's a formula for such nested expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Maybe I can model this recursively. Let me denote a_n as the value at each layer n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, in general, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{hom} = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{part} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, we arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is building up a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression step by step to see if that's possible. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me define each nested part as follows: Let\u2019s denote the innermost expression as E1: E1 = 1 + 3 Then, moving out, E2 = 1 + 3*E1, E3 =1 +3*E2, and so on up to E9, which is the expression inside the outermost 3*(...). Then, E = 3*E9. So, as we did before, E1 = 4, E2 =13, E3=40, etc., up to E9=29524, so E=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, if I try to expand the entire expression without using layers, it might get too messy, but let's see: E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let's try to compute the innermost part first: The innermost part is 1 +3 =4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 +3*4=13. Then, 1 +3*13=40. Then, 1 +3*40=121. Then, 1 +3*121=364. Then, 1 +3*364=1093. Then, 1 +3*1093=3280. Then, 1 +3*3280=9841. Then, 1 +3*9841=29524. Then, finally, 3*29524=88572. So, same result. I think this is solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step follows logically, and using the formula for the linear recurrence relation also leads me to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the computed value is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value at each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer, n=9, resulting in a_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, looking at the values: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. We know that L_1 = 4. So, plugging n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. Also, for n=2: L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we can set up a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtract equation (1) from equation (2): (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Let me think if there's a pattern or a geometric series here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, assume the particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.

Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. Given a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's find another equation. Let's compute a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. According to the general solution, a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.

Wait, but let me check my earlier steps because that seems quite a large number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have made this easier, instead of computing each layer step by step. Because computing each layer manually is time-consuming and prone to errors. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a recurrence relation. Let's see. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a_n represents the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which might be faster for larger numbers. But since in this problem, n=9, computing step by step is manageable, though a bit tedious. I think I've verified it thoroughly, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). To solve it, compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5.

Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do arithmetic quickly, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 3 * 29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure that I correctly computed each layer. I think I might have made an error in the earlier layers because the numbers are growing quite rapidly. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

So, the way I approached this problem was by recognizing the nested structure and working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involved computing a new layer by substituting the result of the previous layer. This methodical approach helped me avoid mistakes and ensured that each step was correct before moving on to the next. It was a bit time-consuming, but breaking it down made it manageable. I also double-checked each layer's calculation to be sure, which is a good practice to avoid errors, especially with such a long expression. In the future, if I encounter similar nested expressions, I can apply the same strategy: start from the innermost part, compute each layer step by step, and verify each calculation to maintain accuracy.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Hmm, let's see. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It's similar to a geometric series but not exactly because each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Wait, actually, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, we have a recurrence relation here. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is known. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms our earlier result using a different method. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3.

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the layers. Let me check again because I might have miscounted the layers.

So, let's see:\n\nStarting with the innermost: 1+3=4.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nFrom the expression, I can see that after the initial 3(, there are 8 more layers, each starting with 1+3(...). Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs, each time inside another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers. Let me see: Each time, we have a 1 + 3(....

But the original expression is 3*(Layer9). So, the final answer is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I miscounted the layers because the problem seems to have 9 layers, but when I computed up to Layer9, that's correct. Let me confirm the number of layers by counting the parentheses. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3(...), so each layer adds another set. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each 1 + 3(...) adds another layer. Let me count how many times I see a 1 + 3(...): \n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n2. Then another 1 + 3(...\n3. And so on, until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, perhaps there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Wait, no, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. So, Layer9 is the outermost one, and then we multiply by 3. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I count the layers, I might have miscounted. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can represent this expression as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, let's compute a_1 to a_9:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, yes, a9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, the outermost layer is 3*(a9). Therefore, the final answer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, rewrite the recurrence as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now. I double-checked using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time if there are more layers. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1 =4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, whose solution is L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p +1 => L_p -3*L_p=1 => -2*L_p=1 => L_p= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition: L_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: L_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9)=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers increases. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) can be expressed as \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to find the result without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to express the entire expression in a more general form. Let's denote the innermost expression as a1, then a2 = 1 + 3a1, a3 = 1 + 3a2, and so on up to a9. Then the entire expression is 3*a9. So, in general, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but a1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, as we computed earlier. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. We can try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me recall that for linear recurrence relations of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n} * a0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), where a0 is the initial term. In our case, c=3, d=1, and a1=4. Wait, but in our case, the recurrence starts at a1=4, and each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, perhaps the general formula is a_n = 3^{n} * a0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2, where a0 is the initial term. Wait, maybe I should adjust the indices correctly. Let me think. Let's consider the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a1 = 4\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as we can see, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1=4.\n\nTo find a closed-form solution, let's consider the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n=> A = 1 + 3A\n=> -2A = 1\n=> A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n=> 4 = 3C - 1/2\n=> 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n=> C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, yes, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.

Wait, but let me double-check my computations because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long process. Let me recompute each layer to make sure I didn't make an error.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches. Then Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13, which also matches. So, using this formula, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is exactly what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation method gave me the same result.

Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or count incorrectly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer: 1 + 3, then each layer up to the first one (which is the outermost). Wait, but when I started earlier, I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, but perhaps the outermost is Layer 1, and the innermost is Layer 9. Let me clarify that. Let me think: the entire expression is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, the innermost part is the last (1+3), which is the ninth layer. So, perhaps I should have started by computing the innermost as Layer 1, then moving outward. Wait, that's what I did earlier, right?

Sometimes, when doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscompute a layer, which would throw off all subsequent layers. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers check out. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's solid. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, perhaps I can try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider the general form. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Now, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution can be found using the method for solving linear recurrences. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me find A and B. First, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since d is a constant, we can assume B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, if I were to compute this using the closed-form formula without computing each layer, I could directly compute a_9 as (3^{10} -1)/2, then multiply by 3. But since I already did it both ways, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Let me just recap the steps: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation. 3. Use a recursive formula to model the pattern, derive a closed-form solution, and confirm the result. 4. Multiply the final layer result by 3 to get the overall answer. 5. Verify the calculations through multiple methods to ensure accuracy. This process helps in avoiding mistakes and ensures that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

But wait, let me check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the previous computations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\nThen 3*29524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But wait, let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me write out the terms again to see if I can find a pattern or perhaps a formula.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4,\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13,\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40,\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121,\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364,\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093,\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280,\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841,\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a particular solution is a constant B, so B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds for all layers up to n=9. Therefore, the innermost Layer 1 is a_1=4, and Layer 9 is a_9=29524. Thus, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the expression is a geometric series with ratio 3 and some number of terms. But since it's nested, it's a bit different. The closed-form formula I derived earlier seems to work perfectly, so I think I'm confident in the answer.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without going through each layer. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3. So, if I consider a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I did earlier. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the ninth layer, a_9, would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation\u2014I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. It's a linear recurrence relation of the first order. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. Wait, what's the initial condition? Let's see, Layer 1 is L_1 = 1 +3 =4. So when n=1, L_1=4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9. So, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*( (59049 -1)/2 )=3*(59048/2)=3*29524=88572. So, same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have L_9, which is the innermost layer, let's compute L_9 using this formula. L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2, but in this case, n=9. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to look at it. Either way, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers, which propagates outward. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As computed earlier, that's 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or a formula. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. So, in general, each term can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost as layer 1, up to layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to check using a different method to ensure that the answer is accurate. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).
