    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 7 5 2. Wait, let me check that again because 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carry 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3*29524 should be 88572. Let me confirm with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check that step because if that's wrong, everything else will be off. So Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, yes, Layer9 is indeed 29524, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, step-by-step is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's denote a_n as the value at layer n. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, we can model this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 =4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by repeatedly evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me compute 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer would be 88572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous computations. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). With Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3*Layer(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Substituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers:\n\nFor n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*( (3^(n+1) - 1)/2 ), where n=9. So, 3*( (3^10 - 1)/2 ) = (3^11 - 3)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. This gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I think I've thoroughly checked each step, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Let me compute this properly:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Wait, that's 88,572, which matches the sum I got earlier when breaking it down into place values. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But let me check my earlier layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. So, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about this. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L(n). The general form of such a recurrence is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, which is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence is L(n) = a^n * C + d, where d is the particular solution and C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_p(n) = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: L(1) = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*L(9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a repeating pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\( L(n) = 1 + 3L(n-1) \\). Solving this recurrence gives a formula, which when applied, results in the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\( 1 + 3(\\text{previous term}) \\).\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation**: Let \\( L(n) \\) represent the value of the nth layer.

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do it step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems consistent. So, I think my answer is correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach, perhaps looking for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as before. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a formula gives me the same result. That makes me more confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of a geometric series. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so when we expand the expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But since it's finite (nine layers), it's more like a finite geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression step by step to see if that helps. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on. As I did before, but perhaps writing it out more explicitly. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods. I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each step again to ensure no arithmetic errors. Let me go through each layer once more: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let me compute this carefully: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. I think I've double-checked each step, so I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572. Maybe another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, if I consider the expression as a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from a_1 = 4, then after 9 terms, the value would be a_9, and then multiplied by 3. But I already used this approach earlier with the recurrence relation, so it's consistent. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but since it's finite and each term is multiplied by 3, the sum would be S = 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8). Wait, let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). If I expand this, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms. Wait, but actually, the number of terms might be different because each layer adds another multiplication. Let me try to expand it:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nSo, each layer adds another 3^k term when expanded. Let me see:\n\nAfter expanding Layer 9, the expression would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, when fully expanded, it's 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*something, so when you expand it all, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. So, the sum is from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k. Wait, but that's a geometric series with 10 terms (from 3^0 to 3^9). The sum of a geometric series is S = (r^n - 1)/(r - 1). So, S = (3^10 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*S = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's another way to look at it, using the sum of a geometric series. That's a much quicker way! So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I can recognize that the expression inside the outermost parentheses is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, 10 terms, starting from 3^0 up to 3^9. Therefore, the sum is (3^10 -1)/2, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. That's a neat approach and confirms the previous results. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, solve the recurrence relation, or recognize the sum as a geometric series, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition.

Let's break down 29524 into parts: 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4.\n\nThen, 3*(20000 +9000 +500 +20 +4) = 3*20000 +3*9000 +3*500 +3*20 +3*4 = 60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12.\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 +27000 =87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))) step by step, ensuring that each layer is correct.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nCompute the innermost 1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So:\n\nLayer1:4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I can compute the expression using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer, which resembles a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost.\n\nSo, a1 =1 +3=4\n\na2=1 +3*a1=1 +3*4=13\n\na3=1 +3*a2=1 +3*13=40\n\nAnd so on, up to a9=1 +3*a8=29524\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C\n\nSolving for C: C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1=4:\n\na1= A*3^1 + (-1/2) =3A -1/2=4\n\nSo, 3A=4 +1/2=9/2\n\nThus, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this thorough step-by-step approach, including verifying each layer and even deriving a closed-form formula, confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward, recognizing a pattern that allows us to compute each layer efficiently.

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have miscalculated. Let me write it out step by step: 29524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, writing it from the top: 8 (ten-thousands place), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572. Hmm, but when I did 29524 * 3, I think 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524:\n\nAdding units: 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nTens: 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nHundreds: 5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carryover 1.\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carryover 1.\n\nTen-thousands: 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, add 59048 + 29524:\n\nUnits: 8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\nTens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nHundreds: 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1.\n\nTen-thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. That matches my earlier result. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. But wait, I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I should check if I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. The innermost is 1+3. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the inside: 1+3\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, but the original expression has nine layers of 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is 1+3, and each subsequent layer up to Layer 9. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved as follows. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find C, we can assume that the particular solution is a constant, so let's set a_n = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but using the closed-form, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2 = 29524. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series with ratio 3, but since it's nested, it's a bit different. However, the recurrence approach seems to work well here.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute a few layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers check out. Therefore, the final result is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified each part to make sure there are no mistakes. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time helps prevent errors. Using the recurrence relation also gave me the same result, which adds confidence in the solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost layers, we find that Layer 9 is 29524. The entire expression is then:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a geometric series perhaps? Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., as I computed. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B +1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B +1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.

Using the closed-form solution \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), we find \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., which matches what I calculated earlier. So, the expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the 9th term in this sequence. So, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly without calculating each layer step by step. That would have saved time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually. Anyway, I think I'm confident that 87572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative step-by-step method and the formula using the recurrence relation gave the same result. So, I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524=88572 (as computed earlier). So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, which might have saved me time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. To solve such a recurrence, we can find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the closed-form expression saves time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing step by step was manageable. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have been helpful. But either way, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's not the right way because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 1500 +72=1572. Then, 87000 +1572=88572. Yep, same result. So, all methods confirm that 29524*3=88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in the earlier steps.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to compute this without having to compute each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. But just for practice, let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula here. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88752. So, that's consistent.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is built using the previous one. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as Layer 9 that I computed earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I end up with the same answer, which is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Units place is 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place is 7, carry over 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15.

Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that matches. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step, just to be certain. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to a_9, then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we saw earlier. Now, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution. Let's assume a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. We can factor out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values we have: For n = 1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we computed earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get to the same answer using the closed-form formula. But since the problem didn't specify to find a formula, just to compute the value, computing each layer step by step was sufficient. But it's good to know that there's a pattern and a formula behind it. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) another similar expression. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we compute each subsequent layer until we reach the ninth layer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I computed up to Layer 9, then multiplied by 3. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here, instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a geometric series. Let me consider that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series without computing each layer, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible, though time-consuming. However, using the formula, we can directly compute a_9 and then multiply by 3. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, all the layers check out, and the multiplication at the end is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think about this problem as a geometric series or find a pattern that allows me to compute it without expanding each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually. However, if the number of layers were larger, maybe I could find a formula. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but perhaps it's overcomplicating for this problem since the number of layers is small. However, for completeness, let's see if we can express a_n in terms of a_1. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1=4, and the outermost layer is layer 9, which would be a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2: 59048 /2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation for Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without expanding each layer, which would be helpful if there were more layers. But since we only have nine layers, it's manageable either way. However, it's good to know that the general formula exists for such problems. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Wait, but let me try computing it another way just to be absolutely sure. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1). Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a(n). The recurrence relation is a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try solving it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a(n) - 3*a(n-1) = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_h(n) = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_p(n) = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a(n) = a_h(n) + a_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n = 1, a(1) = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, a(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a(9), we have a(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a(9) = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute it another way. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. Let me see if that's the case. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*something, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. Let me try to represent this as a sum. If I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But actually, the inner expression is the same as E/3, because E = 3*(inner expression). Wait, that might not be the case. Let me think. Let me define S as the inner expression: S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Then, E = 3*S. But S itself can be written as 1 + 3*S', where S' is the next inner expression, which is similar to S. Wait, but in reality, S has the same structure as E, except that E is 3*(S). Wait, perhaps I can set up an equation. Let me try that. Let me denote S = 1 + 3*S. Because each time, the inner expression is 1 + 3 times the next inner expression, which is similar to S. So, S = 1 + 3*S. Solving for S: S = 1 + 3S => S - 3S =1 => -2S=1 => S= -1/2. Wait, that can't be right because all the layers we computed were positive numbers. So, perhaps this approach isn't correct because the expression is finite, not infinite. I tried to model it as an infinite series, but in reality, the expression has a finite number of layers, specifically 9 layers. So, using the closed-form formula is more appropriate here. Therefore, I think the earlier approach is correct, and the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the innermost layer (Layer 9) equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier computation because I might have made a mistake in the digit positions. So, when I multiplied 29524 by 3, I got 88572, which seems correct when broken down as above. So, that's the final result.\n\nWait, but let me go back to the layers. Did I compute each layer correctly? Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, I see that each layer adds another set. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each time wrapping another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer, which would be the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost before the final 3 multiplier. So, my computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is small (nine), computing each step manually is feasible.\n\nBut just for knowledge, the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4 can be solved as follows. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution, say a_p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so using the formula, I also arrived at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't remember the formula, computing each layer step by step is a solid approach, as I did earlier.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use that result in the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process, each time substituting the previous result into the next layer.\n4. After computing up to the 9th layer, which gives 29524, multiply by 3 to get the final answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I can't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the outermost layer (Layer 9), we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back through the layers to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that could have been recognized earlier to compute it without doing each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, actually, a_1 is 4, but in our case, the first layer is 4, which is a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me find the particular solution. Assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, but our initial conditions are positive integers, so maybe this approach isn't directly helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the recurrence in terms of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 3^1*4\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2*4\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(1 + 3^1 + 3^2*4) = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3*4\nContinuing this pattern, Layer n would be: sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^{n} *4\n\nWait, let me check that. For Layer 2: 1 + 3^1 + 3^2*4? Wait, no, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13, which is 1 + 3^1*4. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(1 + 12) = 1 + 3 + 36 = 40, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2*4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 36) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 108 = 121, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3*4. So, in general, Layer n is sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^{n} *4.\n\nWait, but when n=1, Layer 1 is 4, which would be sum_{k=0}^{0} 3^k + 3^{1}*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is not correct. Hmm, maybe my indexing is off. Let me try again.\n\nWait, actually, for Layer 1, it's 1 + 3 = 4. So, perhaps the general formula for Layer n is sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^{n} *1? No, that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, maybe each layer adds another term. Let me think of it as a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, perhaps the total can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let's consider that each time we expand a layer, we're adding another 1 and multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost layer, each expansion adds a new term. Let me try to express Layer 9 as a sum:\n\nLayer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 7))\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(Layer 7)\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*(Layer 6))\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*(Layer 6)\nContinuing this way, Layer 9 would be sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*(Layer 0), but wait, Layer 0 would be the innermost term, which is 1 + 3, so Layer 1. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too convoluted. Alternatively, since each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, we can compute a_n using the formula for a linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, as I tried earlier. Wait, let me solve the recurrence relation properly.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write this as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n^h - 3*a_{n-1}^h = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so:\n\nLayer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this makes sense, and I didn't see any errors in my calculations. So, I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 8,8,7,5,2. Wait, let me write it correctly: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, so 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6+1=7, so 7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27+1=28, so 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6+2=8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524: 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Hmm, but let me think again. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers. Looking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nWait, I notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this recurrence. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s, the closed-form solution is a_n = r^n * a_0 + s*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. So, the general solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, a_1 is 4, so perhaps a_0 would be the value before the first layer. Let me check: If n=1, a_1 = 4 = 3*a_0 + 1. So, 4 = 3*a_0 + 1 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. So, the initial term a_0 is 1, which makes sense because the innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4, so a_1 = 4. Therefore, the general formula would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Substituting a_0 = 1, we get a_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me simplify that: a_n = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer, which would be especially useful if the number of layers was much larger. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable, though time-consuming. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step method and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 *3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, but let me double-check all the layers because that seems like a lot of computation, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. But wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3(, then inside that is 1+3(, so that's two layers. Wait, no, the first 3( is the outermost, then inside it is 1+3( which is the first layer, then inside that is another 1+3(, and so on until the innermost 1+3. Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions. Each time we have a 1+3(, so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's one. Then each layer adds another. So the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1). Up to Layer 9: 1+3*(Layer8). So that's 9 layers, and then the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So my initial computation was correct with 9 layers, leading to Layer9 = 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me find the closed-form solution. First, the homogeneous solution is when c = 0, so a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = A*3^{n}. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer.

So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value at each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the outermost layer efficiently. Finally, multiplying this value by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(inner expression). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Recurrence Relation**: Recognize that each layer follows the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence gives a formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this yields a_9 = 29524.\n\n4. **Compute the Final Result**: Multiply the value of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. 0 + 5 = 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. So that gives 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That recurrence relation looks familiar. It seems like each term is a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. Now, let's compute a few more terms to find another equation. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. So now we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, because (3^{n+1}/2 - 1/2) is equal to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Yes, that's correct. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049; 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, I end up with 88572 as the final answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same place. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote L1, L2, L3, ..., L9 as the layers from innermost to outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent Ln in terms of n. Let me see if I can find a recurrence relation here. Each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. So, that's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let's see, the recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n is Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire expression in terms of n layers, it would be 3*( (3^{n+1} -1)/2 ). But in this case, n=9, so 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I computed each layer step by step, then found a general formula for the layers, verified it with the initial terms, and then applied it to the 9th layer. Then multiplied by 3 as per the original expression.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, I might be able to compute the value without calculating each layer. Let me try to find a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, that's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's also consider the next term: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Hmm, maybe it's easier to see that each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Wait, let me check: The innermost is 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) ... Up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29,524 =88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be seen as 3*a_n, where n=9. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^{10}=59,049, 3^{11}=177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 =88,572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, the result is 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the recurrence relation, the general formula for the nth layer is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For n=9 layers, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29,524 \\). Multiplying by the outermost 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which could be error-prone. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might help. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can use the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to verify using a different method to ensure accuracy, especially with such a repetitive and nested structure. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, let me verify that again because 29524 * 3: Let me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000. But 29524 is 30000 - 476. So 90000 - (476 * 3). 476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So 1200 + 210 = 1410 + 18 = 1428. So 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result. I think that solidifies the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be modeled with recursion. Let me define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. So, the sequence is defined recursively by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. If I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is known. For a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Wait, let me recall the exact formula. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*k^n, and the particular solution is a constant if c is constant. Let me solve it properly.\n\nGiven the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n^h = 3*a_{n-1}^h.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, it's a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth term. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_1 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It seems that each term is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it thoroughly. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014direct computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So starting from the innermost, each time we have \"1+3(...)\", so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time I see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo that's 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. So, 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step, in case I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me see. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's consider the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that seems right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, but I need to make sure that I computed each layer correctly.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9: (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nYep, that all adds up. So, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is found to be 3 times the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But when adding the carries, it's 2 (from 12), then 7 (from 6 +1 carry), then 5 (from 15, carry 1), then 8 (from 27 +1 carry), then 8 (from 6 +2 carry). Wait, that would be 88572? Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1. 9 + 9 = 18 +1=19, write down 9, carry over 1. 2 + 2 = 4 +1=5. So, 59048.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9. So, each layer Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for Ln. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me write it as Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Lp = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. So, then the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the step-by-step approach. So, yeah, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recursive pattern, we can find a closed-form solution using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\), leading to the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula for the ninth layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, let me check that again because 29524 * 3 should be calculated as follows: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6+1=7, carryover 0, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27+1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8.

Hmm, but let me verify that because when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Let's list out each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but I'm wondering if there's a pattern here that could have been recognized earlier, maybe a geometric series or something, which could have saved computation time. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, L_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is based on the previous term. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved to find a closed-form expression, which might make it easier to compute without having to calculate each layer individually, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach to solving such equations is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution, L_n^{(p)}. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier layers to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form solution, we could have directly computed L_9 and then multiplied by 3 without computing each layer. But since the number of layers is manageable (only 9), either method works.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*(3^{9+1} -1)/2. Wait, no, because the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, 3^{10}=59049. Then, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I've got it right. The final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually. Let's consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, yes, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So that's another way to think about it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the final layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 8 8 7 5 2. Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result of the entire expression is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the layers in the original expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1. 3(1+3(...) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each 1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer1))\nLayer3: (1+3(Layer2))\nLayer4: (1+3(Layer3))\nLayer5: (1+3(Layer4))\nLayer6: (1+3(Layer5))\nLayer7: (1+3(Layer6))\nLayer8: (1+3(Layer7))\nLayer9: (1+3(Layer8))\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that's 9 layers, which I computed as Layer1 through Layer9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, Layer1: 4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. But just to be sure, maybe I can compute each layer again step by step to see if I made any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, Layer9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for it, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually might be more straightforward and less error-prone. However, just for fun, let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could represent this.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer n can be represented as:\n\nLayer(n) = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1)\n\nWith Layer(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for Layer(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form:\n\nLayer(n) = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence:\n\nLayer(n) = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1)\n\nAssume Layer(n) = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, Layer(n-1) = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSimplify:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer(n) = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, Layer(1)=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is:\n\nLayer(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, Layer(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nLayer(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nLayer(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nLayer(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nLayer(4) = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our case, Layer9 is when n=9:\n\nLayer(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms it again. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have kept computing each layer step by step, which is what I did initially, and still arrive at the correct answer. It's reassuring that both methods give the same result.\n\nI think I've got this. The key was to recognize the nested structure and compute each layer starting from the inside. It's like peeling an onion; each layer depends on the previous one, so you can't skip ahead. Also, recognizing the recurrence relation helped me see a pattern, which is a useful skill for these kinds of problems.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and start from the innermost parentheses.\n2. Compute each layer step by step, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time.\n3. After computing all layers up to the ninth, multiply the result by 3.\n4. Verify the result using an alternative method, such as finding a closed-form formula for the layers.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. It also reinforced the importance of careful arithmetic to avoid mistakes, especially when dealing with large numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
