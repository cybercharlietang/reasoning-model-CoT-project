Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to have an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279.

Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, all layers check out.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The recurrence is: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution, L_n^{(p)}, for the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution. Let's assume L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since each L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, same result. That's a good check. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I went through both methods: step-by-step computation and using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and both gave me the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can check if there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let's see: Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

Let me write it out properly:\n\n       2 9 5 2 4\n     \u00d7        3\n     -----------\n       8 8 5 7 2\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result of the entire expression is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each one. Alternatively, this looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Wait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(...), where the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(...)\" starting from the innermost. The innermost is 1 + 3, then each time we go out, we add another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers? Let me see: 1+3 is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers? Let's see, the expression is 3 times a term that starts with 1 + 3, and that term itself is 3 times another term, and so on, until we get to 9 layers because each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and there are 9 of them. Wait, no, let me count. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)). So, the first layer after the initial 3 is the first (1 + 3(...)), which is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So, 9 layers in total. So, when I computed up to layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct. But just to make sure, let me compute a few layers manually again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Wait, but just to make sure, let me try computing a few more layers manually or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented by a recurrence relation or a geometric series. Let's see if that's the case here. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which might be faster and less error-prone, especially for larger n. But since n here is only 9, either method works. So, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from the innermost layer of 1 + 3. By computing each layer step by step or using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the innermost layer (a_1) is 4, and each subsequent layer up to a_9 is 29524. Multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).

Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. Wait, actually, L_1 is 1+3=4, L_2=1+3*L1=13, L3=1+3*L2=40, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me write out the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern: L1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1 + 3*1? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1=4. When n=1, L1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches L1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches L2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches L3=40. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121, which matches L4=121. Great, so the formula seems correct. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, it would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire original expression in terms of the formula, it's 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, 9 + 9 = 18, 2 + 2 = 4. So that would be 59048.

Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

So, that seems correct. I think I did this correctly each time. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, this looks familiar. Each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so perhaps it's a geometric series. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014iterative layer-by-layer computation and using the recurrence relation formula\u2014give the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can derive a formula to find the solution efficiently. Each layer follows a recurrence relation, leading to the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me verify with another method. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLet me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. So, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are 9 opening parentheses, so 9 layers. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost one. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute a_9: (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*(29524) =88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe outermost expression is \\(3 \\times 29524\\).

But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers, which is quite a few. Maybe there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here. Let's think about it. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result without computing each layer step by step. That's a good check. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series inside. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost expression as a1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nSimilarly, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nWait, this looks like powers of 3. Let's see:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^1 + 1) = 4.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. But 3^2 + 3^1 + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13. So that's correct.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, a4 would be 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1 = 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 121.\n\nWait, so each layer an = sum from k=0 to n of 3^k.\n\nWait, but in our case, the layers go up to a9, which would be sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k.\n\nWait, but let's check: a1 corresponds to sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na2: sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\na3: sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nYes, so in general, an = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, because the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of r^k is (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, so it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me confirm that formula. The sum S = 1 + r + r^2 + ... + r^n = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). So, for r=3, S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer an, which is the sum up to 3^n, an = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a1, which is 1 + 3 = 4, which would correspond to n=1, so a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\na3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, in general, the nth layer is an = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, no, actually, let me check: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*previous. So, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...). The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)), so the number of layers is 9. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because each layer an corresponds to n+1 in the exponent. So, a1: n=1, exponent 2; a2: n=2, exponent 3; so a9 would be n=9, exponent 10.\n\nSo, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * a9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * a9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result.\n\nSo, this method confirms that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing the number of layers. Since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, does that mean we have a9 as computed? Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer wraps around that, so up to layer 9, which is the outermost. So, yes, a9 is the correct term, and thus 3*a9 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))) with 9 instances of 1 + 3. So, each layer adds another 3*term, and we have 9 such layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)). With f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12? Wait, no, that might not be accurate because in the innermost layer, it's just 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, which would be f(2) = 13, and so on. Wait, perhaps f(n) is the value of the nth layer. So, f(1) = 4, f(2) = 13, f(3) = 40, etc. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*f(9). So, using this recurrence, we can compute f(9) as we did earlier, which is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, solving the recurrence relation f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. Let's try that.\n\nThe recurrence is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1, with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say f_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition f(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method also confirms the same answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the recurrence correctly. The initial condition was f(1)=4, which is correct because the first layer is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, using the recurrence f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1, we can compute f(2) = 3*4 + 1 = 13, which matches our earlier calculation. Similarly, f(3) = 3*13 + 1 = 40, which is correct. So, the recurrence is correctly applied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. So, after n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we found.\n\nTherefore, after 9 layers, f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nLet me check once more with a different approach, perhaps by expanding the expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with all previous calculations. I think I've verified it enough times to be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 in another way. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, after all these steps and verifications, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, so that's 88572. But earlier, when I did the digit-by-digit, I got 87572, which is conflicting. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me check again: 29524 * 3: Let's write it out:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x       3\n   -----------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87572. But when I added the components, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check the addition again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them step by step:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's 88572. But when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me do it another way: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding these: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, my digit-by-digit multiplication must have been wrong. Let me check that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 8 5 7 2? Wait, no, that would be 88572, but according to the addition, it's 88572. Wait, but when I write it digit by digit, I have 8 (from the 2*3 + 2 carry), then 8 (from 9*3 +1), then 5, then 7, then 2. So, 8 8 5 7 2? Wait, that would be 88,572. But 29524 *3 is 88,572? Wait, no, 29524 *3 is 88,572. Wait, 29,524 *3 is 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit earlier when I thought it was 87,572. It's actually 88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't miss anything. Starting from the innermost parentheses, Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, just to double-check, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach is correct. For example, let's say we have 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). Let's compute this step by step. Innermost parentheses: 1+3=4. Next layer:1+3*4=13. Next layer:1+3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. So, that's correct. Now, using my method: Layer1=4, Layer2=13, Layer3=40, then 3*40=120. Perfect, that matches. So, my approach seems valid.\n\nAnother test: Let's take 3(1+3(1+3)). Innermost:1+3=4. Next layer:1+3*4=13. Then, 3*13=39. Compute directly: 3(1+3(1+3))=3(1+3*4)=3(1+12)=3*13=39. Correct again. So, my method works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence it's correct for the larger problem.\n\nTherefore, I think my step-by-step computation is accurate, and the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. After computing the innermost layers up to the ninth layer, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a linear recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = a + b. In this case, a = 1, b = 3. The solution to this recurrence can be found using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence relation. The formula is L_n = (b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) when a = 1. Wait, let me check that. Let me see, for the recurrence L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms: L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, it's clear that each term is growing exponentially, which makes sense because of the multiplication by 3 each time. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A and C are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find the closed-form solution. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer, which is reassuring. I think that's solid. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))), with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula where each term is defined based on the previous one. I can try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let's consider the recursion L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can write out the first few terms and look for a pattern. L_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\nWait, no, L_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3*1. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*1) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*1)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, I see a pattern here. Each L_n seems to be the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 and adding n terms. Let me check:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3^1 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121\nYes, that's correct. So, in general, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but wait, when n=1, L_1=4 which is sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k: 1 + 3 = 4. Similarly, L_2 is sum from k=0 to 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. So, yes, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Because the sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, so sum is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the geometric series. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by recognizing a geometric series pattern. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recursive formula leading to a sum of a geometric series. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we compute the final value step by step, resulting in the answer:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the result is 88572. So, putting it all together, the final result is 88,572. Let me just check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a few layers again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's check Layer 3: Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13=39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 4: 3*40=120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. Layer 5: 3*121=363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364=1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093=3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. I think that's right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=1+3=4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but since this is a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern or closed-form formula. Let me write down the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got before. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I double-checked using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, and both gave me the same result.

Let me go back through each layer computation again to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's compute from the innermost parentheses: Starting with the innermost 1 + 3 = 4.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572? Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount the layers step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting over, innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the sequence is: a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe this sequence can be represented by a formula. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Thus, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method to verify. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So my digit-by-digit method was wrong because I misaligned the digits. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me go back and check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.

Wait, that would be 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Each time, it's 1+3(...), so how many times does this happen? Let me count the opening parentheses after the 3s. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and inside that, there are eight more layers of 1+3(...). Wait, no, actually, each layer adds one more 1+3. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Each time, it's 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1+3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each being 1+3*(previous layer). So, when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, that's correct, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88,572.

Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88752. Wait, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's compute 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Wait, that's different from 88752. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in my multiplication.

Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me recompute each layer quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each layer is correctly computed. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused because when I computed 3*29524, I thought it was 88572, but let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's see.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, let me confirm:\n\nWait, actually, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my previous result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it using the formula for a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... up to some power. Let me see.\n\nWait, let's consider that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nExpanding this recursively:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}.\n\nContinuing this way, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0.\n\nWait, but a_0 would be 1, since when n=0, a_0=1.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59049 - 1 over 2, which is 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each layer again using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so each layer is correctly computed using the formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let me verify each step again. Layer1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 + 3*40=1 + 120=121. Correct.

Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. The particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So total is 1200+210=1410 +18=1428.\n\nThus, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again to ensure that I didn't miscalculate any step.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each '3('.\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each '3(' adds a new layer. Let me count the number of '3(':\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me count the number of '3(' in the expression. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each '3(' corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first '3(' is at the very beginning, then each subsequent '3(' is inside the previous parentheses. So, how many '3(' are there?\n\nLet's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's nine '3('s, meaning nine layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, my earlier computation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. It might be possible to find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + r*L_{n-1}, where a is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, a = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation is L_n = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1) + L_0, where L_0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, but in our case, L_1 = 4, which is when n=1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should adjust the indices.\n\nLet me define L_0 = 1 (the innermost term before any multiplication?), but that might not fit. Alternatively, let me see.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4.\n\nWait, if n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nn=2, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nn=3, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for L_n = a + r*L_{n-1} is L_n = C*r^{n} + d, where d is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation properly.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFind a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nThis confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct, and the formula approach gives the same result.\n\nSo, to wrap it up, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe can solve this by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. **Layer 2**: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n3. **Layer 3**: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n4. **Layer 4**: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n5. **Layer 5**: $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364$\n6. **Layer 6**: $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093$\n7. **Layer 7**: $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280$\n8. **Layer 8**: $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841$\n9. **Layer 9**: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, so 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, so 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So the result is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm using another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524. Let's add digit by digit: 4+4=8, 2+2=4, 5+5=10 (write 0, carry 1), 9+9=18 +1=19 (write 9, carry 1), 2+2=4 +1=5. So that's 59048. Now add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Again, adding digit by digit: 8+4=12 (write 2, carry 1), 4+2=6 +1=7, 0+5=5, 9+9=18 (write 8, carry 1), 5+2=7 +1=8, 0+ nothing=0. Wait, that gives 88572. Wait, no, wait: 59048 + 29524: Let's write them down:\n\n  59048\n+29524\n=?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n0 +5=5, write 5.\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8, write 8.\n\nSo the sum is 88572.

Then, multiplying Layer9 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it another way. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 =1 +3=4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1=1+3=4, then a_2=1+3*a1=1+12=13, and so on up to a_9=1 +3*a8=29524.\n\nSo, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is known. The general solution for a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n}*(a0) + c*(r^{n} -1)/(r-1). Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, actually, for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + b, the solution is a_n = k^n * a0 + b*(k^n -1)/(k-1), where a0 is the initial term.\n\nIn our case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, so k=3, b=1.\n\nSo, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a0 + (1)*(3^{n} -1)/(3-1).\n\nBut in our case, a1 =4, which is 1 +3=4. So, perhaps a0 is 1, because a1=1 +3*a0, where a0=1.\n\nWait, let me think again. Wait, the first term is a1=4, which is 1+3*1. So, a1=1 +3*a0, where a0=1.\n\nSo, if I use the formula, a_n = 3^{n} * a0 + (3^{n} -1)/(3-1).\n\nSo, for n=1: a1=3^1 *1 + (3^1 -1)/2 =3 + (3-1)/2=3 +1=4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a2=3^2 *1 + (3^2 -1)/2=9 + (9-1)/2=9 +4=13. Correct.\n\nSo, for n=9, a9=3^9 *1 + (3^9 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a9=19683 + (19683 -1)/2 =19683 + 19682/2=19683 +9841=29524.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be faster or less error-prone. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a*b^{n} + c, where c is a constant. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n = C*b^n, where b is the coefficient, which is 3 here. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (a=1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say P. So, substituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can express 3*L_9 as 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's consistent.

Sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.

Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding step by step is manageable. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it that way as a check. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, and we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer would be a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation. The final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Because from right to left, it's 2,7,5,8,8. So the number is 88572. That matches the earlier addition method. So 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern, maybe a geometric series or something similar, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be more straightforward, especially since it's not too long.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to find a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the first few layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: a_2 =13, and so on up to Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute a_9: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it step by step, and also derived a formula which gives the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. If I can find a closed-form expression for L_n, that might be quicker than computing each layer. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I use the formula for L_n, I can compute L_9 directly without computing each layer. Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, then 3*L_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it all together: 8 8 7 5 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again: 29524 * 3: Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. Wait, but let me verify: 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's add them: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let me break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula, but given that each layer is a linear function of the previous one, it might just be a matter of computing each step. Alternatively, maybe there's a recursive formula here. Let me think about that. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier. So, the expression is 3*a_9. So, to compute a_n, we can use the recursive formula, but since n isn't too large, computing each term step by step is feasible. Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2, we get a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we need a_9, let's compute that: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outer expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both the recursive step-by-step method and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be more than 80000. Wait, let me check again. Wait, 29524 is 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3. Let me compute it as 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then subtract 476 * 3 because 30,000 - 476 = 29,524. So, 476 * 3 = 1,428. Therefore, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Wait, but that seems inconsistent with my previous digit-by-digit approach. Let me check using another method. Alternatively, 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, that's consistent. Therefore, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9. Then, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a formula for L(n). The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is L(n) = A*3^n + B. Let me solve it. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). The homogeneous solution is Lh(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution, say Lp. Then, Lp = 1 + 3*Lp. Solving for Lp: Lp - 3*Lp = 1 => -2*Lp = 1 => Lp = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, but what's the initial condition? When n=1, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L(1) = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is a geometric progression. But since I already got the answer through both iterative computation and the formula, I'm confident that 88,572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my computations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake when dealing with so many layers. Let me go back step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, all the layers check out, and the final multiplication is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially since this seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression inside is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series where each term is defined recursively. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, using the closed-form formula, I can directly compute the answer without having to go through each layer step by step. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, it's manageable either way. So, just to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from 1 + 3. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, I could derive a formula to compute the nth layer directly, which saved time instead of computing each layer individually. Either method leads to the same answer, so I can be confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize it as a nested pattern where each layer is defined recursively. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find the value of each step until we reach the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500+72=1572. Now, add 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire expression in terms of exponents, I could note that each layer adds a power of 3. But since I've already computed it step by step and verified with the formula, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of the form 1 + 3*(...).

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because that's a lot of layers, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1 for n >= 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for Ln. The recurrence is:\n\nLn = 1 + 3*Ln-1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Ln = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check if this formula works with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*( (3^10 -1)/2 ) = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( n \\) ranges from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost layer. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply by 3 to get the final result:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nWe verified the result using a recurrence relation approach, confirming that the final answer is indeed:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
