    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify one of the layers to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's check Layer 3: Layer 2 is 13, so Layer 3 should be 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. I think that's right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the innermost value and work our way up to the outermost layer.

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, but that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be more than 80000. Wait, let me check again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check Layer 9 again: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 29524*3: As above, 88572. So, the final result is 88572. But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier for a_9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. I think I've got it!\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a recursive sequence, we can compute each layer step by step. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation confirms the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, let me write it properly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me check using another method. 29524 * 3: 30000 *3 = 90000, minus (30000 -29524)=476 *3=1428. So 90000 -1428=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be more efficient, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. In this case, n=9. So, each layer is of the form a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1=4. Wait, but in my earlier computation, a_1 was 4, a_2=13, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_k = c + r*a_{k-1}, the solution is a_k = c*(r^{k} -1)/(r -1) + a_0, but in this case, a_1 is 4, so perhaps starting from k=1. Wait, let me think again. The standard form is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution and particular solution. Let me try to model it.\n\nGiven a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 1. Wait, actually, no, the equation is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, so the homogeneous solution would be when a_k = 3*a_{k-1}, which has the solution a_k = C*3^{k}.\n\nThen, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_k = C*3^{k} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nk=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nk=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nk=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer k, a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if there are many layers. But since I only have 9 layers, both methods work.\n\nAlternatively, I can also think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me explore that approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses, each layer adds another 3 times the previous term. So, the expression can be expanded as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nExpanding this, each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the power corresponding to its depth. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost term is 3, then moving out, each 1 is multiplied by 3^{n} where n is the number of layers beyond that point.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the expression as a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 1 to 9, plus 1s multiplied by 3^{k} as well.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nEach layer contributes 1*3^{k}, where k is the number of layers above it. Since there are 9 layers, the innermost term (Layer 1) is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1)=1 + 3*4=13, which can be written as 1 + 3*4=1 + 3*(1 + 3)=1 + 3 + 9=13. Wait, but 1 + 3 + 9=13? No, 1 + 3 + 9=13? Wait, 1 + 3=4, plus 9 is 13. Wait, but that's not the same as 3^2=9. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be written as a sum of 3^k from k=1 to 9, multiplied by something.\n\nWait, let me try to express the entire expression as a sum. Let's see:\n\nThe outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me expand this:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) = 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)).\n\nBut this seems to lead to an infinite series if not handled properly, but in our case, it's finite with 9 layers.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is to recognize that each time we have 1 + 3*a, where a is the next layer. So, each a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, which we've already solved using the recurrence relation.\n\nBut perhaps using the formula a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2 is the most straightforward way, as we did earlier.\n\nSo, with k=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the entire expression without using the formula. Let me try expanding it step by step, but more systematically.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)=1 + 3*13=1 +39=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, whether I use the step-by-step approach or the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. By expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step until we reach the outermost layer, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinal step: Multiply by 3.\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions.

The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to 9 layers, I think. Because each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer, and I count nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3(...). So, yes, 9 layers, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in this case, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 13, a3=1 + 3*a2=40, etc.\n\nSo this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and the solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3A => A = -1/2. Wait, that can't be right because our a_n are positive. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the particular solution.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to solve it iteratively. Let me compute a few terms:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich is what I did before, so the value at layer 9 is 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I have:\n\nFor n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've thought through this carefully, checking each step and even deriving a general formula to confirm the result. It seems solid. So the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer, we find the value at each step until reaching the outermost layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(inner expression). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me verify my computations because sometimes when I do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me check each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me try another way to compute the final multiplication to ensure I didn't make a mistake there. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down into parts: 29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Then, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, add them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final answer is indeed 88572. I think I did it correctly.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps because sometimes when you compute layer by layer, you might make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let me write out the terms again to see if I can find a pattern or a formula. L_1 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each L_n is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 =81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9 for the innermost? Wait, no. Wait, in our earlier labeling, Layer 1 was the innermost, which corresponds to n=1. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be simplified by recognizing a pattern and using a recursive formula. By breaking down each layer and applying the formula for the nth term, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then moving out, each time it's 1+3(1+3(...)). So, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me parse it:\n\n3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3\n)))))))))))\n\nSo, each time, the number of layers increases by one. Wait, actually, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances. Let's see: Starting from the first 3, the next is 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on until the innermost 1+3. So, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let me count each occurrence:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. So, that would mean there are 9 layers? Wait, but when I computed earlier, I had Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time adding another layer, so 9 layers in total. So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say I have a similar expression but with fewer layers. For example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, that's 3 layers. Let's compute it step by step.\n\nInnermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, computing the expression directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, my method works for a smaller version. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem, which has 9 layers, should give the correct result of 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again, just to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, each step seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the equation is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\nSubtract 3A from both sides:\n\n-A = 1\n\nSo, A = -1\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1\n\n4 = 3C - 1\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\n5 = 3C\n\nSo, C = 5/3.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (5/3)*3^n - 1 = 5*3^{n-1} - 1.\n\nWait, let's check that:\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = 5*3^{0} - 1 = 5*1 - 1 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = 5*3^{1} - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14. Wait, but earlier we computed L_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, according to our earlier computation, Layer 2 was 13, but according to the formula, it's 14. That means I must have made a mistake in solving the recurrence.\n\nWait, let's go back. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nWait, let me try solving the recurrence again.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nL_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nL_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nL_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\nL_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\nL_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nSo, the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 gives the correct value for each layer. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, and then multiplying the outermost layer by 3, we arrived at the solution. Additionally, recognizing the recurrence relation allowed us to derive a formula, which confirmed our step-by-step computation.\n\nI think that's thorough. I can't spot any errors in the reasoning, and the smaller test case worked, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go back through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 (As computed above) So, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or a formula. The expression seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is built using this recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find B. For n = 1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Now, let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's check this with n=1: L_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, we can think of it as 3*(L_9). So, using the formula, it's 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form formula. This gives me even more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've thoroughly checked this, so I'm ready to present the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, I think I did it correctly. Each layer was computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and proceeding outward. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series but nested. If I were to generalize this, each layer n can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Solving such a recurrence relation would give me a formula, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step was manageable. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern, I could have noticed that each step is similar to a base-3 number or something, but in this case, step-by-step computation was straightforward. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute a couple of layers. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me do this multiplication again to confirm: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.

This looks like a geometric series, but it's nested, so maybe each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and work from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier, I thought I got 88572 as well. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Next digit:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, reading the digits from top to bottom, it's 8 (from the ten thousands place), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572. That matches the other method, so I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me go back and check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's recompute each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has nine layers of 1+3(...), right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), and so on until Layer9. So, yes, 9 layers. So, I think my computation is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the outermost layer, it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Okay, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the homogeneous part would be a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we get the same result without computing each layer manually. That's a more efficient way, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, computing step by step is manageable, though a bit time-consuming and error-prone. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time. But since I was initially unsure, computing each layer was a safe approach. Either way, both methods led me to the same final answer. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find each subsequent layer's value. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the nth layer, which simplifies the process. Applying this formula, we find the value of the innermost layer and propagate outward, finally multiplying by 3 for the outermost layer. The result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check if I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps. Each layer seems to be computed correctly, and the multiplication at the end is correct. So, yeah, I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r is the coefficient and c is the constant term. In this case, r = 3 and c = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. To find B, the steady-state value, we set a_n = a_{n-1} = B. So, B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. What's the initial condition? Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and using the formula for the linear recurrence. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Each layer's computation checks out. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or formula that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The general solution for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = C*k^{n} + D, where D is a particular solution.\n\nWait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution A*3^{n}. Then, we look for a particular solution, which is a constant since the nonhomogeneous term is 1. Let's assume the particular solution is a constant D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. The expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) can be thought of as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. But in this case, since it's nested, it's more of a repeated multiplication.\n\nBut since I've already confirmed using both the step-by-step computation and the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I think I'm solid here.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and plan to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, ensuring each computation is correct.\n\n3. Derive a general formula using recurrence relations to confirm the result without computing each layer manually.\n\n4. Verify the formula with known values to ensure correctness.\n\n5. Multiply the final layer result by 3 to get the overall answer.\n\n6. Double-check all computations for accuracy.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and a recurrence relation is used to confirm the result. The final answer is computed as follows:\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Let's see, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps I can model this as a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. Let me define a sequence a_n where n is the number of layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, as I computed before, a_9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I could try to find a pattern or formula for a_n in terms of n, but since n is only 9, it's probably faster to compute each layer step by step. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the a_n values: a_1 = 4 = 4\na_2 = 13 = 4*3 + 1\na_3 = 40 = 13*3 + 1\na_4 = 121 = 40*3 + 1\na_5 = 364 = 121*3 + 1\na_6 = 1093 = 364*3 + 1\na_7 = 3280 = 1093*3 + 1\na_8 = 9841 = 3280*3 + 1\na_9 = 29524 = 9841*3 + 1\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each a_n is 3*a_{n-1} + 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula, I get the same answer, which is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or make a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572, which should be the final answer. Alternatively, I could think of this problem as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. However, if I were to generalize this, I might look for a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since I'm dealing with a small number of terms, computing each step is straightforward. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4 can be solved as follows: The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. Similarly, for n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using both iterative computation and the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think that's thorough enough. I considered both methods, checked each step, and even derived a general formula to confirm the result. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the nested expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4.

Alternatively, I could notice that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, each a_n can be expressed as a geometric series. Let's see: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n... and so on.\n\nThis looks like a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nTo solve this recurrence relation, we can find the closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\nB - 3*B = 1\n-2B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*L_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is especially useful if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step was manageable. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the key was recognizing the pattern in the nested expressions, computing each layer from the inside out, and then multiplying the outermost layer by 3. Alternatively, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a formula gives the same result, which is a good way to verify the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested pattern in the expression.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the expression starts with 3(1 + 3(...)), so the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, which I did. But just to be sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, that's three layers. Let's compute that. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Outer layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, let's compute it step by step: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. So that works. Let's try two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, compute directly: 3(1 + 3(4)) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. So, my method seems to work for smaller cases. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem, which has nine layers, I get 88572 as the result. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let's see. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but wait, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, is that correct? Let me double-check my layers because maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let's go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layers.

Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers are correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.

Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The structure of the problem is similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term depends on the previous one. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nFor n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\nFor n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\nFor n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\nFor n=5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\nFor n=6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\nFor n=7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\nFor n=8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\nFor n=9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula works for all layers. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work thoroughly. It's always good to verify using a different method, especially when dealing with nested expressions that can be easy to miscalculate. So, yeah, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. \n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

But just to make sure, maybe I can try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if the pattern holds. Let's say I have a simpler version with fewer layers, like 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that manually and see if the method works.\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nStart with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, compute step by step:\n\nCompute innermost: 1+3=4\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, compute the expression as is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the smaller version using the same method as before:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120. So, the method works for the smaller case, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the inner layer. So, starting from n=3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). But in this problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, and each layer builds on that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me think about it. Suppose we have a function f(n) where f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, for n=1: 4, n=2: 13, n=3:40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nSo, for the problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9, so f(9) would be the innermost expression. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9). Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for f(n). Let me try to find that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + C, where A is a constant determined by the initial condition, and C is a particular solution.\n\nAssume f(n) = A*3^n + C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + C = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + C)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*C = 1 + A*3^n + 3C\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + C\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^n + 3C\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + C = 1 + A*3^n + 3C\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nC = 1 + 3C\n\nSubtract 3C from both sides:\n\n-2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, the particular solution is C = -1/2.\n\nThen, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\nf(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nf(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost expression is f(9), because there are 9 layers. So, f(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 =87572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, I can express the entire original expression using the formula. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(f(9)) where f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = (3*59048)/2.\n\nCompute 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=87572.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute the answer more quickly without computing each layer step by step, but it's good that both methods give the same result.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, 3^10 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is29524, times 3 is87572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is87572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and the smaller example worked, so the method is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as f(n), where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: The relation can be defined as:\n   - f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1)\n   - With the innermost layer f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The recurrence relation is a linear non-homogeneous equation. Solving it, we find a closed-form solution:\n   - f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Innermost Layer**: Since there are 9 layers, compute f(9):\n   - f(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times the result of the 9th layer:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 87572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{87572}$"

So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's write down the first few terms: L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is growing exponentially. To solve the recurrence relation L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{9+1} -1)/2 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, that's another way to write it. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Using this pattern, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this.

Hmm, but let me verify my earlier layers because that seems quite a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers.

Each layer is computed correctly. So, 88572 is the result. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but nested. Let me try to find a pattern. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it step by step. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value at each step grows exponentially. Using a recurrence relation approach, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer triples this value and adds 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let's denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we did before. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Specifically, if we have a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, then the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Let me try to derive it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me write down the terms:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, but wait, actually, in our case, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3, so maybe the initial term is a_1 = 4, and then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to index the layers starting from 1 to 9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is defined by the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, in general, for such a recurrence relation, the solution is a geometric progression. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, but since I was able to compute it step by step and also derive a formula, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This pattern continues up to the ninth layer, which results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it down step by step:\n\nMultiplying 29524 by 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method to be sure.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me go back and make sure I computed each layer correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the earlier steps, which would throw off the final result. Let's recompute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check once more because sometimes when you have nested expressions, especially with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers or miscompute a step. Let me try computing each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to approach this instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2192 Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula confirms our earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1, so it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. But in this case, since each term is defined recursively, the formula approach was more efficient.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't spot any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers I computed. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the number of layers isn't too large, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is following a recurrence relation, maybe I could model it with a formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_h(n) = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p(n) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a(n) = a_h(n) + a_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step builds on the previous one, and the closed-form formula confirms the result.

Yes, that's correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the earlier calculations. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then 3 * 29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3A => A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a formula for such a recursive expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write the recurrence relation as: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can find another equation by considering the homogeneous solution. Alternatively, we can solve for A and B by considering the recurrence relation. Let's find the particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

After computing up to the ninth layer, we got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result of 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is following a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote a_n as the nth term, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the ninth layer, a_9, would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. So, all the layers check out, and the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try computing the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and it's usually of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. First, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D \u21d2 D = 1 + 3D \u21d2 -2D = 1 \u21d2 D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem using the same method to see if it works. Let's take a smaller nested expression, say, 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this manually. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, using the formula: n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Then, 3*a_3 = 120. Let's compute it step by step: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, the method works for a smaller case, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem.

For n=0, a0=4. Plugging into the formula: (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2=1. Hmm, that's not matching. So maybe my formula is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} + 1)/2.\n\nLet me check for n=0: (3^{1} +1)/2 = (3 +1)/2=4/2=2, which is not equal to a0=4. So that's not it either.\n\nWait, maybe I should derive it step by step.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a0=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a0=4:\n\n4 = A*3^0 + (-1/2) => 4 = A*1 - 1/2 => A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify this: a_n = (9*3^n -1)/2.\n\nAlternatively, since 9 = 3^2, this can be written as a_n = (3^{n+2} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=0: a0 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=1: a1=(3^{3} -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for n layers, starting from a0, the value after n layers is a_n = (3^{n+2} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from the innermost as a1=4 up to a9=29524. Wait, but according to the formula, a9 would be (3^{11} -1)/2, since n=9: 9+2=11.\n\nWait, 3^11 is 177147, so a9 = (177147 -1)/2 = 177146/2=88573. Wait, but earlier, when I computed layer 9 as 29524, then 3*29524=88572, which is one less than 88573.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(...). So, if I consider the innermost part as a1=4, then the next layer is a2=13, and so on up to a9=29524, then the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut according to the formula, a9=(3^{11}-1)/2=88573. So, 3*a9=3*(88573)=265719, which is way bigger than 88572. So, clearly, I'm misapplying the formula here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of layers. Let me count the number of times the expression 1 + 3(...) appears.\n\nLooking back at the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3\n- Then, the next layer is 1+3*(...)\n- So, each time we add a layer, it's another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nLet me count the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThere are nine sets of (1+3(...)), each adding a layer. So, n=9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had 9 layers, from a1 to a9, each adding one more. But according to the formula, a9=(3^{11}-1)/2=88573, which when multiplied by 3 gives 265719, which is way off from my manual calculation of 88572.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps my formula is not correctly aligned with the problem's structure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of layers. Let me try to visualize the expression again.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3*(...), and each time we go out one layer, we add another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier manual computation, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But according to the formula, a9=(3^{11}-1)/2=88573, which is one more than my manual calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps my formula is off by one because I'm starting the count from a0=4, which is the first layer, but in the problem, the first layer after the initial 3 is 1+3, which is a0=4, then the next layer is a1=13, and so on up to a8=29524, because the total number of layers is 9, so n=8.\n\nWait, that might be it. Let me check: If I have 9 layers, starting from a0=4 up to a8, then a8=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a8=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That matches my manual calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a8=3*29524=88572, which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula is a_{n} = (3^{n+2} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers minus one. Since we have 9 layers, n=8, so a8=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step manual computation since the formula might be tricky to apply correctly here, especially with the indexing.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal multiplication: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, starting from the units place: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000; 9000 * 3 = 27000; 500 * 3 = 1500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.
