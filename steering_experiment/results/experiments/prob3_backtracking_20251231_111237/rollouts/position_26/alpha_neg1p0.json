    "text": " Then, Layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Continuing this way, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. 1 + 3*40 = 121. 1 + 3*121 = 364. 1 + 3*364 = 1093. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Each step, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1. So, it's like each layer is following the formula: next_layer = 1 + 3*current_layer. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, the final step is multiplying by 3, which gives 88572. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps? The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the innermost being layer 1, and the outermost being layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start. So, the expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. This shows that the expression can be evaluated either by expanding each layer step by step or by recognizing the pattern and using the closed-form formula. Both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident now that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a closed-form formula derived from a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\), leading to the solution \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the given expression with 9 layers, the result is \\( \\frac{3^{11} - 3}{2} = 88572 \\).\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe I should do it digit by digit to avoid mistakes. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, it's 88,572. Hmm, that's what I got earlier. But let me cross-verify. Alternatively, 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048; 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check each layer because sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12 =13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 +3*13 =1 +39=40 (correct).

Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524=88,572. Okay, so that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait a second, but I feel like this might not be correct. Let me try an alternative approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is layer 1: a_1=4, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). Therefore, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 =59,048/2=29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^10=59,049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, after double-checking, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form solution. Each layer \\( a_n \\) is given by \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the innermost layer (n=1), this computes to 4, and each subsequent layer follows. The outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think I did each step correctly, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Hmm, this expression is a geometric series or something similar? Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. So, we can model this as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method, I also get 88572, which confirms my earlier result.

Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about whether there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*(3)^n, and a particular solution can be found as a constant, say a_n^p = k. Substituting into the recurrence: k = 1 + 3k => k - 3k = 1 => -2k = 1 => k = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, both methods agree, which makes me confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let me do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with so many digits.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's break it down: 30000 * 3 = 90000, but since it's 29524, which is 30000 - 476. So, 3 * 29524 = 3*(30000 - 476) = 90000 - (3*476). Now, 3*476: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200 + 210 + 18 = 1428. Therefore, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. But let me check if I did the layers correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check my multiplication again just to be sure. 29524 * 3: Let's do it digit by digit. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a geometric series? Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))), it's a repeated application, which can sometimes be expressed using the formula for a geometric series or using recursion. Let me try to model this. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in computing 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each step checks out. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me try computing it in a different way to see if I get the same result. Alternatively, I could notice that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. So, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we're looking at a recurrence relation here. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is linear and has the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1)*(r)^{n-1}, but wait, that formula is for when the recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. Let me make sure I have the right approach. Actually, the standard form for a linear recurrence relation is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + d. In this case, k = 3 and d = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + d*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. But in our case, a_1 = 4, so maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let's see: If n = 1, a_1 = 4. For n = 2, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. For n = 3, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which also matches. So, the general formula would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence relation, we can use the method for solving linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, where A is a constant. Next, we find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values:\n\nFor n = 1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 3: (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 4: (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for the first few terms. So, using this formula, we can compute a_9, which is the value of the innermost expression before the final multiplication by 3. Let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is correct.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again using the formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer from 1 to 9:\n\na_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything still checks out. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the inside out, I arrived at the final result. Additionally, by recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, I derived a general formula to compute the nth term directly, which also led me to the same answer. This dual approach gives me confidence that I didn't make any computational errors along the way. So, I think I'm done here. The final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Hmm, let's do it step by step to avoid mistakes. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500; 88,500 + 60 is 88,560; 88,560 + 12 is 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer 1:4, layer2:13, layer3:40, layer4:121, layer5:364, layer6:1093, layer7:3280, layer8:9841, layer9:29524. Then 3*29524=88,572. That seems consistent. I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something, but given that each term is 1 + 3*(previous), it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe there's a formula for that. Let me think about it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, solving this recurrence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let me find the particular solution. Assume a_n = C. Then C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. But since I was computing each layer step by step, it's reassuring that both methods give the same result. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9). Let me write that down: Final result: 3 * 29524 = ? Hmm, let me calculate that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let me do it step by step to avoid mistakes: 29,524 * 3. Multiply each digit by 3, starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my multiplication again because 29,524 * 3 seems too high. Wait, 30,000 * 3 is 90,000, so 29,524 * 3 should be 88,572. Hmm, actually, that seems correct. Let me confirm with another method. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering the number of layers, it's possible. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is computed as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1, a_1=4; n=2, a_2=13; n=3, a_3=40; and so on, up to a_9=29,524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C first. Assume that a_n = C for all n. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. Hmm, but that seems odd because all our a_n values are positive. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should solve it using homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88,572. Wait, but I just want to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, especially with such large exponents. Let me confirm 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3: Let me compute 29,524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048; 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.

It was a bit tedious, but by breaking it down layer by layer, I managed to compute each step without getting lost. I hope I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way.

So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for Layer n. The recurrence relation is: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's a simple one. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Specifically, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, Layer n = 3^n * (Layer 0) + (3^(n) - 1)/ (3 - 1), but wait, I might be mixing up some formulas here. Let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. The solution is a_n = r^n * a_0 + c*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). In this case, a_1 = 4, r = 3, c = 1. Wait, but our first term is Layer 1 = 4, which is a_1. So, to fit the formula, let's adjust the indices. Let me define a_0 = 1 (since Layer 1 = 1 + 3*Layer 0, if Layer 0 is 1). Then, the recurrence becomes a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. So, using the formula for linear recurrence: a_n = r^n * a_0 + c*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r = 3, c = 1, a_0 = 1. So, a_n = 3^n * 1 + 1*(3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2. Simplifying that: a_n = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer n = a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: Layer 1 should be 4. Plugging in n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, since Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result, which is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods agree. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this again step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. Hmm, 88,572 seems like a big number, but considering how each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's going to grow exponentially. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving it this way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me compute the layers again one more time to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. Alternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572. I think I've verified it enough times. It seems solid. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

It's a bit tedious, but taking it step by step and verifying each layer helps prevent mistakes. I was a bit worried about keeping track of all the layers, but numbering them from 1 to 9 made it manageable. Each time, I just computed the next layer by plugging in the previous result, multiplied by 3, then added 1. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially. The numbers get big pretty quickly, which makes sense because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, leading to a kind of geometric progression. So, after nine layers, it's not surprising that the number is in the tens of thousands. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap the steps: 1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). 3. Compute each layer step by step up to the ninth layer. 4. Multiply the ninth layer's result by 3 to get the final answer.

Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, then 500 is 29500, and then 24 is 29524.

So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. But just to be thorough, let me check one of the layers again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's pick Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Another check: Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Okay, I think all the layers are correct. So, multiplying the outermost 3 by Layer 9 gives 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it using a different approach. Sometimes, recognizing a pattern can help confirm the result. Let's see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each step is a linear function applied repeatedly. In fact, this looks similar to a geometric series but with a constant multiplier. Let me try to model this. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's see if there's a formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's easier to write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P - 3*P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which makes me confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I didn't recognize the pattern, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, and that also gave me 88572. So, either way, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

I didn't make any calculation errors this time. It seems that the final result is indeed 88,572. I think I've got it right. To make sure, maybe I can compute it in another way or look for a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for the recurrence relation, the homogeneous solution is 3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me solve for A and B. Using the equation: 4 = 3A + B. Also, let's consider the next term: a_2 = 3*a_1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. Plugging n=2 into the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9\n\nA = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, plugging A = 3/2 into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4\n\n9/2 + B = 4\n\nB = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2).\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula holds for each layer. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression up to Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, so 3*29,524=88,572. So, my initial step-by-step computation was correct, and the formula confirms it. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula approach gives the same result, so I must be right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1. Using a recursive formula, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the given problem with 9 layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each step is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, it's like a recursive sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I can find a general formula for a_n, that might be a quicker way instead of computing each layer. Let me try that approach. The recursive formula is: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n...\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\nD - 3*D = 1\n-2*D = 1\nD = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Wait, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, right? So, n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, using the formula, the value is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Calculating each layer step by step leads to the final result. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence also confirms the solution.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break that down. 29524 * 3. I can do this by multiplying each digit by 3 and carrying over as needed. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, that gives 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Maybe I should write down each layer's computation to double-check. Let me list them again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, perhaps a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer up to a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the arithmetic, let me recompute 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29,524 * 3\n\n= (20,000 * 3) + (9,000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (20 * 3) + (4 * 3)\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 +27,000 =87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2, and 3^{11}=177,147, then (177,147 -3)=177,144, divided by 2 is 88,572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Let me compute it properly. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 24 * 3 = 72. So, adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify using another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps.

Because the outermost part is 3 times the result of the innermost expression. So, let's compute that: Total = 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Hmm, let me calculate that. 3 times 29524. Let's break it down: 3*29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*24 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88,572. Wait a second, did I do that right? Let me double-check the multiplication: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 8*3=24 +2=26, carryover 2; 6*3=18 +2=20. So writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12 =13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, everything seems to check out. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, each step is 1 + 3*(previous value). That's a geometric progression, right? Or maybe it's similar to a geometric series. Let me think about that. If I have a term defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each subsequent term is built from the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe there's a formula for the nth term of such a recurrence. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*r^{n} + (a_0 - c/(1 - r))*(1 - r^{n})/(1 - r), assuming r \u2260 1. Wait, actually, I think the general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Let me check that. So, in our case, a_1 = 4, and each a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Comparing this to the standard form, r=3, c=1. So, the general solution should be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (1*(3^{n} - 1))/(3 - 1). But wait, our initial condition is a_1=4. So, perhaps we need to adjust the indices. Let me think. If n=1, a_1=4. So, maybe a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} -1)/2. But I need to find a_0 first. Wait, a_1=4, so plugging n=1 into the formula: a_1=3^{1} * a_0 + (3^{1} -1)/2 = 3*a_0 + (3 -1)/2 = 3*a_0 + 1. But a_1=4, so 3*a_0 +1=4 => 3*a_0=3 => a_0=1. So, the general formula is a_n = 3^{n} *1 + (3^{n} -1)/2 = 3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2. Let's simplify that: a_n = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} -1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, which is what I calculated step by step. So, using the formula confirms that the result is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and used the formula to compute it directly, saving some time. But since I was unsure at first, breaking it down step by step was a good way to verify each layer and ensure I didn't make a mistake. It's also helpful to see how the recurrence relation works and how it relates to the formula, which can be a powerful tool for solving such problems in the future. So, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back through each layer to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Wait, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's see, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 3*29524: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let's do it digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So writing it down: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 2*3=6. So the result is 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large quickly. Let me check if I'm interpreting the expression correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). I think I did that correctly each time. So starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, 1 +3, then 1 +3*(4)=13, then 1 +3*13=40, etc., up to Layer 9, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But wait, let me count the number of layers again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3, then (1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because each \"1+3(\" adds a layer, and there are 9 such instances after the initial 3. So, 9 layers, each computed as above. So, if I did 9 layers correctly, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer), then the final result is 3*29524=88572. But let me think if there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me this result without computing each layer step by step. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let's see. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a formula for a_n. Let me try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. I started by computing each layer step by step, then found a pattern and a formula to confirm the result. It's reassuring that both methods gave me the same answer. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572. I think that's the answer. Let me just go through it again quickly to make sure I didn't miss any layers or make any multiplication errors. Starting from the inside: 1+3=4; 1+3*4=13; 1+3*13=40; 1+3*40=121; 1+3*121=364; 1+3*364=1093; 1+3*1093=3280; 1+3*3280=9841; 1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88,572. Yep, that all adds up. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I think the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the innermost parentheses first and working outward.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed as a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^{10} = 59049 Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just confirm once more by computing the expression step by step again, to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this multiplication step by step: 29,524 * 3. Multiply each digit by 3, starting from the right: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, the result is 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with the recurrence relation formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). By computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation formula, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It's like each step is taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then using that in the next layer. This seems like a geometric progression or something similar, but since each step depends on the previous, it's more of a recursive computation. I'm a bit concerned about whether I did each step correctly, so let me double-check a few layers to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. Let's check Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. That seems right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That's right. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364.

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. Alternatively, let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 * initial term? Wait, let me recall the standard solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c. The solution is a_n = k^{n}*(a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, k=3, c=1, and a_1 = 4. Let's test this formula. The general solution for a_n where a_1 = 4 is: a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) * c. Wait, but actually, the formula is a bit different. Let me think again. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, the outermost layer is n=9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same as I got before for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step built upon the previous one, and the closed-form formula gave me the same result, so I'm confident in the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, actually, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have messed up the carry-over. Let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStart from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8, no carry.\nSo, putting it all together, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3: Let's compute it another way. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524. Then, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. Each step seems correct. I don't see any arithmetic errors in my calculations. So, I think the final answer is 88572. Wait, just to double-check, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Hmm, the expression is a geometric series in disguise, perhaps? Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which reinforces that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.
