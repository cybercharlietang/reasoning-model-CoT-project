    "text": " Hmm, okay, so each time, I'm taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me continue this process step by step. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses, we have to remember that the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final computation is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 3*29524: Well, 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 29,524 * 3. Multiply 24 by 3: 24*3=72, write down 2, carry over 7. Next digit: 2*3=6 plus 7 is 13, write down 3, carry over 1. Next: 5*3=15 plus 1 is 16, write down 6, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 plus 2 is 8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let's compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\nSo, the result is 88,572. Hmm, but wait, 29,524 * 3 is actually 88,572? Let me verify with another method. 29,524 * 3 can be broken down as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total is 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a minute, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute incorrectly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Each layer is computed correctly. So, the final step is 3*29524=88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. The general form is a repeated multiplication and addition, which can be modeled as a geometric series. Let me consider the expression as starting from the innermost part and working outward. Each step is 1 + 3*(previous step). So, if I denote each step as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, and so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence relation, we can use the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. To find C, we can substitute into the recurrence. Let me assume that a_n = C for all n, then substituting into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost parentheses evaluate to 29524, and then we multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we determine the value of the outermost parentheses and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Final Multiplication:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.

Let's do it digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did this right. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572.

    "text": " Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually, as there are nine layers, and that might take a while. Let me think about this. Each layer is defined as: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer (n-1)) So, this is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's see. Let me denote Layer n as a_n. Then, the recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with the base case a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Great, so the formula seems to hold. So, now, since the original expression has nine layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Now, 3^10 is a number I might not remember off the top of my head, but I can compute it step by step. Let's compute 3^1 through 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, 3^10 is 59,049. Therefore, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times that, right? The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is multiplying this a_9 by 3. Therefore, the final result is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29,524. Let me compute that: 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the total is 88,572. Alternatively, I could compute 29,524 * 3 directly: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 0*3=0; 0*3=0; 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 88,572. Yep, that's the same as before. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. I had a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, which is correct. And 3^{10} is indeed 59,049, so (59,049 -1)/2 is 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, 3 * 29,524 is 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, if I were to compute each layer manually, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, would I get the same result? Let me try that to double-check.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Let me compute that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the result of the entire expression is 88,572. I think that's the right answer. To recap, each layer was computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. This created a sequence that grew exponentially, which is why the numbers got so large so quickly. It's interesting how nested expressions can lead to such rapid growth. I guess the key here was to carefully compute each layer step by step without skipping any, to avoid mistakes. I also had to remember to multiply the outermost layer by 3 at the end. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

I think I did this correctly, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check one of the layers again. Let's pick Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 was 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. So, all the layers seem to add up correctly.

    "text": " Wait, that seems a bit big. Let me double-check. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yeah, that's correct. Layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Hmm, this is growing quickly. Let me keep going.

So, the final computation would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3 times 29524: 29524 * 3. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 +1 =7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Okay, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscalculate any of the intermediate steps. Let me go through the layers again to confirm each step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. I think I did it right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from 1 + 3, each time it's multiplied by 3 and adds 1. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me try to find a formula for the nth layer. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can also think about this as a geometric series. Each time, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But since it's nested, it's a bit different. However, using the recursive approach and the formula I derived, I was able to solve it without having to compute each layer manually, which would have been time-consuming. So, that was a good exercise in recognizing patterns and applying recurrence relations. I think I understand this problem better now. The key takeaway is that when faced with a deeply nested expression like this, it's helpful to look for patterns or recursive relationships that can simplify the computation. Instead of computing each layer step by step, which is prone to errors, especially with so many layers, using a formula derived from the recurrence relation is more efficient and accurate. So, in summary, the problem required computing a deeply nested expression by recognizing a recursive pattern, solving the recurrence relation, and then applying it to find the value of the innermost layer, which was then used to compute the entire expression. This approach saved me from manually computing each layer, which would have been tedious and error-prone.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing this recursive pattern, we can derive a formula to compute each layer efficiently.\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n2. **Solve the recurrence relation**: The general solution is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n3. **Compute the innermost layer**: For layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Now, add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Okay, so that seems correct. So, 3*(29,524) = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer is correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, but wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. From the innermost: 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, let's see: 1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3)) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) \u2192 Layer 3\n...\nContinuing this, how many layers are there? The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, that's correct. Then, 3 times that is 88,572. So, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. Each time I go one layer out, I'm adding another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to find a pattern. Let's compute a few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's find another equation. Let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general form: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations:\n\n1. 3A + B = 4\n\n2. 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 \u2192 6A = 9 \u2192 A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A = 3/2 into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 \u2192 9/2 + B = 4 \u2192 B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if that works with our earlier terms.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}.\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29524 *3: Let's compute 29,524 *3.\n\n29,524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nIn our case, n=9, so 3^{11} -3 over 2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've double-checked each layer, used the recurrence relation, found the closed-form formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost expression's value to be 29,524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again to be sure: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, each step checks out. Therefore, the final result should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that for a moment. The expression is a geometric series or something similar? Let me see. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c is the coefficient and d is the constant. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*c^n + (d/(1 - c)), where A is a constant determined by the initial condition. Let me check that. So, substituting c = 3 and d = 1, the general solution would be a_n = A*3^n + (1/(1 - 3)) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed terms. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, using the formula confirms the result. This is a more efficient way, especially if there were more layers, as it avoids computing each step manually. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the formula for such a recurrence, \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), we find the ninth layer \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the result.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait a minute, that's a pretty big number. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be represented as geometric series or using recursive relations. Let me try to model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. The problem is that we have nine layers, so we need to compute up to a_9, and then multiply by 3. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to find a pattern. Let me compute the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as we can see, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + (c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1) * d, where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, so maybe we need to adjust the indices. Alternatively, let's consider the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (d=1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, we have n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me verify the multiplication step again. 29524 * 3.

Layer 4:1 + 3*40=121 correct. Layer 5:1 + 3*121=364 correct. Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1093 correct. Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=3280 correct. Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=9841 correct. Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=29524 correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 and so on. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, the result is 88,572. I think that's correct. I didn't see any mistakes in my step-by-step computation or in the recurrence relation approach. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that's the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but maybe I miscounted the layers? Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. So, starting from the innermost: The innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers: Starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n2. Then, moving out, the next is 1+3(Layer1), which is Layer2.\n3. Then, 1+3(Layer2) is Layer3.\n4. Then, 1+3(Layer3) is Layer4.\n5. Then, 1+3(Layer4) is Layer5.\n6. Then, 1+3(Layer5) is Layer6.\n7. Then, 1+3(Layer6) is Layer7.\n8. Then, 1+3(Layer7) is Layer8.\n9. Then, 1+3(Layer8) is Layer9.\n10. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers inside the first 3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more quickly. Let me think about that. Each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me write down the general formula. Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no. Wait, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for Layer9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added 1 each time, but it's the same as the recurrence relation. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to check. Let's say Layer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Using the formula, a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, I can trust that a_9 = 29524, and 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the result:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: First, 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me compute it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. Wait, hold on, that seems off because 29524 is a five-digit number. Let me write it down properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x      3\n   -----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is definitely more than 80000. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that seems correct because 30000 * 3 is 90000, and 476 * 3 is 1428, so subtracting gives 88572. Alternatively, let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying each step, I'm confident that the final result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations because each step follows logically from the previous one, and I double-checked the multiplication at the end. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.

Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression another way or look for a pattern or formula that could represent this. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nStarting with L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n... and so on.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C\nWhich is 9/2 = 3*C\nSo, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Good.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then verified using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, which gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the inside out, we find each subsequent layer's value until reaching the ninth layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a derived formula, we confirm the result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, finally, we compute: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n- 5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n- 0 * 3 = 0\n- 2 * 3 = 6\n\nWait, maybe I should do it step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n________\nCalculate each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, no carryover.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, no carryover.\n0 * 3 = 0, write down 0, no carryover.\n2 * 3 = 6, write down 6.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I misaligned the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n________\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2 with a carryover of 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7.\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5 with a carryover of 1.\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8 with a carryover of 2.\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\nNext: 0 * 3 = 0.\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\nTens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\nHundreds: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\nThousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\nTen thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\nSo, writing it together: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units) \u2192 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check:\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was calculating digit by digit, I thought it was 88572, but when I broke it down, I think I made a mistake in the placement. So, actually, 29524 * 3 is 88572.\n\nBut let me verify with another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n________\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6+2=8, write 8.\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by simplifying each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, leading to the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me double-check my calculations because the numbers are growing quite rapidly, and I might have made an error in multiplication or addition somewhere. Let me go through each layer again carefully.\n\nStarting with L1:\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. That's correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, L9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3*(L9). Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So, the total value is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 + 1 =7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many digits.\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\nNext: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, each layer is one more 1 + 3(...). Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miscount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to nine layers. So, yes, L1 to L9, each adding another layer. So, L9 is the outermost, and then multiplied by 3. So, yes, the total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time and reduce the chance of error, especially if there were more layers.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nEach layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recursive relation. It's a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Maybe that would be a better approach for a larger number of layers.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or a formula for L_n.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\n3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, we can express the entire computation using the formula. Since each L_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^11:\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=59049*3=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, whether computing step by step, using recursion, or using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer, each time substituting the result from the previous step into the next layer.\n\nAfter computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. Using a recursive formula, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) can be expressed as \\((3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\). For the ninth layer (\\(L_9\\)), this gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if I can find a pattern here or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. But maybe it's manageable since nine isn't too large a number. Let me proceed step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 3 * 20000 = 60000 3 * 9000 = 27000 3 * 500 = 1500 3 * 24 = 72 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, the total would be 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the breakdown. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 multiplied by 3 is indeed 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer again to verify:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So, each step checks out. I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series but nested. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I calculated before. So, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2: 59048 /2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, I could express the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88,572 as the answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step method. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, let's do it digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,7,8,5,2. So, 87522? Wait, that doesn't match my initial thought. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try again. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. Wait, but 29524 only has five digits, so after 2*3=6 +2=8, that's the end. So, the result is 88572. Wait, so 29524 *3=88572. Hmm, that's the same as I initially thought. So, the final result is 88572. Let me verify this with a different approach to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can recognize the pattern as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3a_1, a_3=1+3a_2, etc., up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, I can model this recursively. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which also matches. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute this multiplication step by step. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,8,5,2. Wait, that would be 87522, but that can't be right because 29524*3 is 88572, as previously calculated. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write it out properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    x         3\n    ------------\n      8 8 5 7 2\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572, which is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this.

    "text": " Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let me compute a few more layers to see if there's a trend. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Wait, but hold on a second. The original problem is 3 times the first Layer 9. So, once I compute Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me check that. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, and 4*3=12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, that's 88,572. Okay, so that seems consistent. But wait, let me check if I've counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times...))). So, when I started, I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, with nine layers, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. Hmm, but let me count the number of layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let's count them: 1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(...\nAnd then the innermost one is 1 + 3), so that's nine layers in total. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost, so I correctly computed up to Layer 9 and then multiplied by 3. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. It seems like each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug the recurrence into this general solution. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, C*3^n + D = C*3^n + (1 + 3D). Therefore, D must equal 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this until the ninth layer is reached, which is 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000; 9000*3=27000; 500*3=1500; 24*3=72. Now, adding these up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +72=88572. So, yes, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer is enclosed by parentheses. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. The innermost is \"1+3)\", then moving out, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count: The innermost is \"1+3)\", then moving out, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers by looking at the number of closing parentheses. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the closing parentheses from the end. Starting from the end: The last part is \")))))))\". So, that's seven closing parentheses. Then, before that, we have \"1+3(\", so each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances. Each time we have \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, the first is \"1+3)\", then each layer out adds another \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought, because each time you have a \"1+3(\" until the outermost. Let me check again:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is followed by a closing parenthesis, except for the innermost one which is just \"1+3\". Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new opening parenthesis, so how many are there?\n\nLet me parse it:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first opening parenthesis is after the first 3, then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers by the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are 8 more \"1+3(\" instances, each adding a new layer, and the innermost is \"1+3)\".\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought, with the innermost being Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9: 1+3*(Layer 8), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 9 layers. So, my earlier computation was correct, with Layer 9 being 29524, and the total expression being 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me write down each layer as I parse the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost part is \"1+3\", which is Layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is \"1 + 3*(Layer 1)\", which is Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13.\n\nThen, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I compute 3*29524, I get 88572, but let me compute it again just to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6, plus 1=7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27, plus 1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6, plus 2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524 \u00d73 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 \u00d73 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) \u00d73 = 20000\u00d73=60000, 9000\u00d73=27000, 500\u00d73=1500, 24\u00d73=72. Adding these together: 60000 +27000=87000, 87000 +1500=88500, 88500 +72=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. If the expression has nine layers, then my computation is correct. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the first \"1+3(\", let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n\nWait, actually, the expression starts with 3(1+3(...)), so that's the first layer. Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+3(\" instances, which is 9, including the first one.\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, the first \"1+3(\" is after the initial 3, then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\nStarting from the beginning: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n\nWait, that's 9 \"1+3(\" instances, so 9 layers. So, my initial computation was correct, with 9 layers, leading to the final result of 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the layers by looking at the number of closing parentheses. The expression ends with \")))))))))\", which is 9 closing parentheses. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, 9 closing parentheses mean 9 layers. Therefore, my computation is correct with 9 layers, leading to 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since the problem is only 9 layers deep, computing each term step by step is feasible. However, for a deeper nesting, a formula would be more efficient. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the numbers I computed:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term seems to be roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me check:\n\nLayer 2: 3*4 +1=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*13 +1=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*40 +1=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so each term is indeed 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution satisfies a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A +1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step and even derived a general formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer, leading up to Layer 9, which is 29524. The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, we have: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 Wait, is that correct?

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. But wait, let me count the number of layers again to make sure I didn't miscount. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1, then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, there are nine layers, each time adding another 1+3(...). So, yes, I think I accounted for all nine layers. So, each Layer 1 to Layer 9 was correctly computed. Therefore, multiplying the outermost 3 by Layer 9 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait a second, let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct, matches a_1=4. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, matches a_2=13. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, matches a_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same as Layer 9 in my earlier computation. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms my previous result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the initial step-by-step computation. Using a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2: For n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=40. Correct. n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=121. Correct. n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=364. Correct. n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=1093.

So, each layer is correctly computed using both methods: step-by-step and the closed-form formula. Therefore, I can confidently say that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Hmm, 3 times 29,000 is 87,000, and 3 times 524 is 1,572. Adding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572.

Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and inside that is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but let me check if I did each step correctly. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nNow, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let's compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- The remaining digits are 9, 5, 2, 9, which when multiplied by 3 give 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 88572 as the final result. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, which could help verify the result. Let's see. Each layer seems to follow the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. The recursive formula is Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. Let me try to unroll this recursion. Let's write out the first few layers:\n\nLayer 1 = 4\nLayer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, since each term is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), let's see if we can find another equation. Alternatively, we can compute the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3*Layer(n-1) = 0, which has the solution A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition, when n=1, Layer 1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me confirm that. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{n} somehow. Let me think. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is 243^2, which is 59049. Then, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3 is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^{11} is 3*3^10 = 3*59049 = 177147. Then, 177147 -3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, that's correct. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. So, the problem is solved by computing each nested layer step by step, recognizing the pattern, and then using a formula to find the result without manually computing each layer, which would be time-consuming and prone to errors. It's a good example of how recognizing a recursive pattern can simplify the problem-solving process.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the recursive pattern, we can compute each layer step by step, leading to the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Outermost Multiplication**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final result should be 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, seems consistent. Maybe I can check with a different approach, like recognizing the pattern as a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation and solve it. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let's see. The innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, correct. Then, Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13, which matches our earlier calculation. Layer 3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which is exactly what we got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms our earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the recursive formula approach led me to the same answer.

So, let's compute that: Final result: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 3 times 29524. Breaking it down: 3 * 29524 = (3 * 20000) + (3 * 9524) = 60000 + 28572 = 88572 Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, it's 88572. Okay, that seems right. Let me recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1. So, Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3*a1, a3=1+3*a2, and so on up to a9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * a0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me check that. The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*c^n. For the particular solution, if c \u2260 1, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = c*K + d => K - c*K = d => K(1 - c) = d => K = d/(1 - c). So, the general solution is a_n = A*c^n + d/(1 - c). Applying initial conditions, say a_0 = some value. Wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, a_2=13, etc. Let me see if I can model this with a recurrence starting from a_1. Let me try to adjust the formula. Let\u2019s say the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, to find a general formula for a_n, we can write it as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the equation: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would correspond to n=9. So, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to see if it still holds. For example, Layer 4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier calculation. Similarly, Layer 5: a5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works, and my step-by-step approach was accurate. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone than trying to find a formula, which I might mess up.
