Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, both methods lead me to the same answer. That gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward here. Another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is building up a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that applies directly here. Alternatively, since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's similar to expanding (1 + 3)^n, but with some differences. Wait, actually, the expansion of (1 + 3)^n would give a sum of terms, but in this case, each layer is a single term, so it's not exactly the same. However, the closed-form solution we derived earlier is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which for n=9 gives 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's solid. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. 3. After computing Layer 9, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. 4. As a check, derive a closed-form solution using recurrence relations to confirm that the step-by-step computation was correct. Both methods agreed, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).
