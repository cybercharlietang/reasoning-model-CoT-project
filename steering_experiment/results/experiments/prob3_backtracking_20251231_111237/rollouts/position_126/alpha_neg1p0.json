Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just make sure that I'm not missing anything in the problem statement. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine 1+3(...) layers. So, yes, the a_9 corresponds to the innermost expression, and then multiplied by 3. So, everything checks out. Alternatively, if I were to code this, I could write a loop that iterates from 1 to 9, computing each layer step by step, which is essentially what I did manually. Let me try to code this in pseudocode to verify: Initialize value = 1 + 3 = 4 For i from 2 to 9: value = 1 + 3 * value After 9 iterations, multiply by 3. So, let's simulate this:\n\ni=1: value = 1 + 3 = 4\ni=2: value = 1 + 3*4 = 13\ni=3: value = 1 + 3*13 = 40\ni=4: value = 1 + 3*40 = 121\ni=5: value = 1 + 3*121 = 364\ni=6: value = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\ni=7: value = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\ni=8: value = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\ni=9: value = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute the multiplication of 29524 by 3. 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that would be 88572, right? Wait, let me write it out:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the number is 8 (ten-thousands place), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572. Correct. So, yeah, I think that's solid. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). We compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue computing each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. The outermost layer is then multiplied by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a layer, and each closing parenthesis corresponds to one. Let's see: Starting from the first 3(, then inside is 1 + 3(, which is the next layer, and so on, until the innermost (1+3). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" segments. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(.

So, a_9 is indeed the correct term. Thus, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a base-3 number or something, but I think the recurrence approach is solid here.
