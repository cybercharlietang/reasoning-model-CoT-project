Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.

So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.

Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can also check with smaller layers to see if the pattern holds. For example, if I had just 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)), that would be 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39. Using the formula, for n=2, a_2=13, then 3*a_2=39. Correct. Similarly, 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*40) = 3*(121) = 363. Using the formula, a_3=40, 3*a_3=120, wait no, wait. Wait, no, wait: Wait, in the formula, a_n is the inner expression, so for 3*a_n, when n=3, a_3=40, so 3*a_3=120. But wait, in reality, 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*40) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121=363. Wait, that's different. Wait, so my formula gives a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, which for n=3 is (81-1)/2=40, but 3*a_n would be 120, but in reality, it's 363. Wait, so I think I made a mistake in applying the formula. Wait, the formula gives a_n as the value of the innermost expression at each layer. But the entire expression is 3 times a_9. So, in the case where n=3, the expression is 3*a_3, which is 3*40=120, but when I compute it manually, it's 363. That suggests a discrepancy. Wait, that can't be. Let me check. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, when I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))), that is, three layers. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40. So, the entire expression is 3*a_3=120. But when I compute it manually: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40=120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 363. Wait, no, I must have miscalculated. Let me compute it again. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40=120. So, yes, 120 is correct. So, my formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=29524, and 3*a_9=88572. So, I think I was confused earlier when I thought I was getting a different number, but no, it's correct.

Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

So, a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think about the problem as repeatedly multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Each time, you're doing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if I were to write a small program or use a calculator, I could compute each step iteratively. But since I'm doing it manually, the step-by-step approach seems the most straightforward. Let me just recap the layers to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. All these numbers seem to follow the pattern correctly. So, I think I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Another way to think about it is that each layer is essentially a geometric progression. Since each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Each term is 3 times the previous term minus 1/2, as per the recurrence relation. But since we're dealing with integers, the fractions cancel out, and we get whole numbers each time. So, everything checks out.

Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer, but since I was able to compute each layer step by step without errors, I think the answer is solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form expression a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives 29524. Multiplying by the outermost 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, both methods lead to the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, use the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2. So, 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.
