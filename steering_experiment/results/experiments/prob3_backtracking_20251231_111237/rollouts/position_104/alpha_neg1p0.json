So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works.

Then, 0 = 1 + 2B => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.

So the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So both methods give the same result. I think that solidifies the answer. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, 29524*3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our previous calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the inside out. 2. Compute each layer step by step, labeling them for clarity. 3. Once all layers are computed, multiply the outermost result by 3. 4. As a check, derive a closed-form formula using recurrence relations and verify it gives the same result. 5. Multiply the final layer result by 3 to get the final answer. So, yeah, 88572 is the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. Using both iterative computation and a derived closed-form formula, the result is confirmed to be 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{expression})\\). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n4. **Verification Using Recurrence Relation:**\n   The nested structure follows the recurrence \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Solving this recurrence gives the closed-form formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n = 9\\), \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\), and multiplying by 3 yields 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Then, 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.

So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just verify once more by computing each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with a_1=4. a_2=1 + 3*4=13. a_3=1 + 3*13=40. a_4=1 + 3*40=121. a_5=1 + 3*121=364. a_6=1 + 3*364=1093. a_7=1 + 3*1093=3280. a_8=1 + 3*3280=9841. a_9=1 + 3*9841=29524. Then 3*a_9=88572.

    "text": " = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation provides a closed-form expression, confirming that the final result is 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next term})\\).

    "text": " = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate coefficients: For 3^n: A = A, which is always true. For constants: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. I think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer's value is determined, leading to the final computation. Using both iterative step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, the result is found to be 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."
