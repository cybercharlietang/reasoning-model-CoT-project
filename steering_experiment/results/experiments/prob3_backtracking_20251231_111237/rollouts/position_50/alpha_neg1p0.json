Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 would be 88572, but let me check with another method to confirm. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add them: 59048 + 29524. 8 + 4 = 12, carry over 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. 0 + 5 = 5. 9 + 9 = 18, carry over 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. 2 + 0 = 2. So, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. So, yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572.

But let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's not exactly the same because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me think about it. Suppose I have an expression of the form a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that matches the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the recurrence approach. Because the original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th layer. But in the recurrence, a_n is defined as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. So, the general formula seems correct. Therefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which again matches my earlier calculation. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So both methods give the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me verify: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So, yes, it's 88572. Hmm, but wait, that seems like a big number, but given that each layer was multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it might make sense. Let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or recognize a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a*r^{n} + b, where r is the common ratio, which is 3 in this case, and b is a constant. Let me solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. But since the problem is finite with 9 layers, it's manageable to compute step by step as I did earlier. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result: 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Suppose I define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. If a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then the homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me solve it properly. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say, B. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4. Plugging n=1: 4 = A*3 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Let me assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check if this formula works for the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we find the outermost layer and then multiply by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me check: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carry 1, write 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carry 1, write 5. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry 2, write 8. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. Wait, but let me verify that because 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572 because 30000 * 3 = 90000, and 29524 is 30000 - 476, so 90000 - (476*3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). In this case, k = 3 and c = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = (4 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Simplifying, that's (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (9/2)*3^{2} - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let's compute that. First, 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Then, (9/2)*6561 = (9*6561)/2. Let's compute 9*6561: 6561*9: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So, 54000 + 4500 = 58500, +540 = 59040, +9=59049. So, (9/2)*6561 = 59049/2 = 29524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_9=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's homogeneous. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's find B by setting a_n = B. Then, B = 1 + 3*B \u2192 B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and used the formula to compute it directly, but since I was working step by step, it's good that both approaches align. I think that's solid.

Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 =177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, that matches.\n\nSo, another way to compute this is to recognize the pattern and use the formula for the nth term of the recurrence, which gives us a direct computation without having to compute each layer step by step.\n\nBut since the problem only had 9 layers, computing each step was manageable, though time-consuming. For more layers, the formula would be more efficient.\n\nIn summary, by computing each nested layer step by step or by recognizing the recurrence relation and applying the formula, we arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using the recurrence relation and its solution, we confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, actually, let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, no carryover.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on a second, in my earlier steps, I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in calculation.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (1+3(...)) sections:\n\nStarting from the first 3(, each (1+3(...) is a layer.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 outermost layer is 3*(...), which is Layer 9.\n\nBut when I numbered them, Layer 1 was the innermost, which is correct. So, I think my counting is right.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that each layer is correctly computed.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify the multiplication again because 29524 *3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo, writing from the top: 8 8 5 7 2.\n\nWait, that would be 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 *3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my layers again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me write out the expression with each layer:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)=1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nSuppose we have an expression like x = 1 + 3x', where x' is another similar expression. But in this case, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, it's a recursive expression. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth layer.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = (3 +1)\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*4 +1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3*13 +1\n\nLayer4:121=3*40 +1\n\nWait, that seems to be a pattern: each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1.\n\nSo, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume L_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 \u2192 K -3K =1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition: L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 =3C -1/2 \u2192 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works for all layers up to n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this using the formula. Since L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can write the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049; 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThen, (3^{11} -3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, using the formula, the expression simplifies to (3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's consistent across both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. Using a formula derived from a linear recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, yes, that gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method to verify. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are nine layers, starting from the innermost. So, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nWait, let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as each layer, then:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on, as before. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis recurrence relation might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, L9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that 3^{10} is indeed 59049. Let me compute 3^10 step by step:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication, let me compute 29524*3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then +29524 again: 59048 + 29524. Let me add them: 59048 + 29524: 50000 + 20000 = 70000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 400 + 500 = 900, 40 + 20 = 60, 8 + 4 = 12. So, 70000 + 18000 = 88000, 88000 + 900 = 88900, 88900 + 60 = 88960, 88960 + 12 = 88972. Wait, that's different from the previous result. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my initial multiplication. Let me try multiplying 29524 by 3 again. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. But when I added 29524 + 29524 + 29524, I got 88972, which is different. There must be a mistake in one of these calculations. Let me check the addition method again:\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524:\n\nAdding the units: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nTens: 2 + 2 = 4\n\nHundreds: 5 + 5 = 10, carry over 1\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 + 1 (carry) = 19, carry over 1\n\nTen-thousands: 2 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 5\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, adding another 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nUnits: 8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nTens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nHundreds: 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\nTen-thousands: 5 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nAh, okay, so my initial addition was wrong.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just verify all my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. So, I think I did it correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I could have used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. I can see that each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is similar to a geometric series, but with a twist because of the +1 each time. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me consider the recurrence relation: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Then, solving this recurrence might give me a formula to compute Ln without computing each term step by step. Let's try that. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say Lp. Plugging into the recurrence: Lp = 1 + 3*Lp. Solving for Lp: Lp - 3*Lp = 1 => -2*Lp = 1 => Lp = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = Ln^h + Lp = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1=4. So, when n=1, Ln=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, matches L1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, matches L2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, matches L3=40. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute each layer directly without computing each step, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But since I only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Anyway, so the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me verify my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c=1 and r=3. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1 - c/(1 - r))*(r)^{n-1}. Wait, but since r > 1, the term (c/(1 - r)) is negative, which might complicate things, but let me try plugging in the values. Here, c=1, r=3, a_1=4. So, the general solution would be a_n = (1/(1 - 3)) + (4 - (1/(1 - 3)))*(3)^{n-1}. Simplifying, 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. Then, a_n = (-1/2) + (4 - (-1/2))*(3)^{n-1} = (-1/2) + (4 + 1/2)*(3)^{n-1} = (-1/2) + (9/2)*(3)^{n-1}. So, a_n = (-1/2) + (9/2)*(3)^{n-1}. Let me compute a_9 using this formula. a_9 = (-1/2) + (9/2)*(3)^{8}. Since n=9, 3^{8}=6561. So, a_9 = (-1/2) + (9/2)*6561. Compute (9/2)*6561: 9*6561=59049, then divided by 2: 59049/2=29524.5. Then, a_9 = (-1/2) + 29524.5 = (-0.5) + 29524.5 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression, perhaps there's a formula that can be applied without computing each layer step by step. But since I already computed it step by step and confirmed with the recurrence relation, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to double-check, maybe I can compute a few layers again to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error. Let's check Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 +4. So, 2*10000=20000, 9*1000=9000, 5*100=500, 2*10=20, 4*1=4. So, 20000 +9000=29000+500=29500+20=29520+4=29524. Now, 29524*3: Let's compute each digit times 3 and carry over as needed. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've verified each step and the final multiplication, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3: Let me check using another method. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So yes, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses is 1 + 3(...). Let's count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count from the inside out: Starting from the innermost (1+3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another layer. The expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, there are 9 layers. Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, that should be correct. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, but let me verify my computations for each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's go step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the expression is 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ) but wait, no, because the layers go up to 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, as we saw. So, 3*a_9= 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form formula. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the closed-form formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

But wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when I multiply by 3, the result should be 5 or 6 digits. Let me actually compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.

Yes, that's correct. So, 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.

Let's add 59,048 + 29,524: 59,048 + 20,000 = 79,048. 79,048 + 9,524 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the computation of each layer. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. Wait, no. Wait, actually, L_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 (since there are 9 layers), L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I wanted to write the entire expression in terms of 3^{10}, I could. But since the problem is just to compute the value, 88,572 is the answer. Let me just make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the exponentiation. 3^10 is 59,049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2,187, 3^8 is 6,561, 3^9 is 19,683, and 3^10 is 59,049. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, L_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 =59,048/2=29,524. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. So, I think that's solid. No mistakes in the steps, as far as I can tell.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but nested. Maybe I can express it recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our problem, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, the total expression is 3*f(9), where f(n) is defined as above. Let me check that. If I define f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4, then f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches Layer 2. f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which matches Layer 3, and so on. So, f(n) gives the value of the nth layer. Therefore, the total expression is 3*f(9). So, if I can find a closed-form expression for f(n), that would save me from computing each layer step by step. Let's try to find a pattern or a formula for f(n). The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: f(n) = A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, set this equal to the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition f(1) = 4: f(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: f(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: f(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, for n=9, f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recursive approach, we define f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1) with f(1) = 4. Solving this recurrence relation gives a closed-form formula f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For n=9, f(9) = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that's not right because 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4. Wait, no, a_1 is 1 +3=4, then a_2=1+3a1, etc. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a1=4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear, so we can solve it. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * a0 + d*(c^{n} -1)/(c-1), where a0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, so c=3, d=1. Let me check: The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)}=B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3B => B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} -1/2. Applying initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4.5 => A=1.5. So, the solution is a_n = 1.5*3^{n} -0.5. Let's test this for n=1: a1=1.5*3 -0.5=4.5 -0.5=4. Correct. n=2: a2=1.5*9 -0.5=13.5 -0.5=13. Correct. n=3: 1.5*27 -0.5=40.5 -0.5=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a9=1.5*3^9 -0.5. Let's compute that. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So, a9=1.5*19683 -0.5. Let's compute 1.5*19683: 1.5 is the same as 3/2, so 3/2 *19683= (3*19683)/2. Let's compute 3*19683: 19683*3: 19683*2=39366, plus 19683=59049. So, 59049/2=29524.5. Then, a9=29524.5 -0.5=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved as such. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the original expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form approach, I also get 88572. This matches the step-by-step computation, so that's reassuring.

So, writing it down: 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when I do these nested computations, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula I can apply here. The expression can be seen as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. This is similar to the expansion of (3^n - 1)/2 or something like that, but I'm not sure. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u21d2 9/2 = 3C \u21d2 C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Correct. Then, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. a_4 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. a_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. a_6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. a_7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. a_8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, that's consistent with what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step expansion and the formula using the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27+1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems high, but let me verify with a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see: a_1 = 4 (from 1 + 3)\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let's check that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I'm misremembering the formula. Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That matches our earlier result. Therefore, a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. Each step builds upon the previous one, and using the recurrence relation helped confirm that my step-by-step computation was correct. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation can simplify the problem, especially if there were more layers, but in this case, even with nine layers, computing each step was manageable. I also double-checked using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, which gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, putting it all together, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer calculation again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct) So, yes, I think that's right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 =3*59048/2=3*29524=88572. So, same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent one adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1+3 around it. Let's count the number of 1+3 expressions:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. Continue until the outermost: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nWait, so that's actually 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on until Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I think my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the computations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the final step is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again because when I computed Layer 8, I had 1 + 3*3280. 3280 * 3 is indeed 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this differently. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 88572, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when I do these step-by-step computations, I might have missed a layer or miscalculated somewhere. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nAnd so on.\n\nI notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\nA - 3A = 1\n-2A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2=364. Correct.\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat! So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using the formula. Since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Exactly the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, used a formula to confirm, and everything lines up. So, I'm pretty sure that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number. Each layer follows the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_{n-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2.

Maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: Starting from the units place: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.

Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, I think I made a mistake. Let me go back and check each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in the earlier steps. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" appears: Let's see, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I only went up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So 9 layers, each computed correctly, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 = 4 up to a_9. So n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I computed earlier. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the recurrence relation approach. The initial term a_1 is 4, which corresponds to n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13. Correct, as computed earlier.\n\nSo yes, the formula holds, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer. Using a recurrence relation approach confirms the result, leading to the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe I made a mistake. 29524 * 3: Let's do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, it's 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, let me check if that was correct. Let's go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572. But wait, that seems like a big number. Let me check my multiplication again just to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3 * 29524 differently. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.
