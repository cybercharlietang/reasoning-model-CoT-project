Wait, but let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's see, 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, wait, wait, hold on. Wait, no, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Wait, let me count the digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).

But wait, let me check my layers again because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time it's multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me think. If I have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To double-check, I can compute the layers again or see if there's another way to approach it. Alternatively, I can compute the expression step by step without using the formula. Let's try that again to confirm. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1:1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13 Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer up to the ninth. Using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, we find that the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3*29524 should be 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me verify my earlier steps because sometimes when I'm dealing with so many layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go back and check each layer step by step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if that approach works. Let's denote the innermost term as a base case and see if it forms a geometric progression. Wait, actually, each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation, and it can be solved using the formula for such linear recursions. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = c*(k^n - 1)/(k - 1) + a_0*k^n, but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found by unfolding it. Let's try to find a closed-form expression. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\na_{n-1} = 1 + 3*a_{n-2}\nSo, substituting back, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\nContinuing this, after n-1 substitutions, we get:\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n}*a_1\nBut since a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3, so a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write the general solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found assuming a constant solution a_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers do we have? The original expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is a_1, up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, let's compute a_9 first using the formula:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I use the formula directly, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By solving each layer from the inside out, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation which can be expressed in a closed form. Using this, the final result is computed as 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n________\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nNo more digits, so the carry over 2 is added? Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying:\n\n4 (units) \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 (tens) \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 (hundreds) \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 (thousands) \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 (ten thousands) \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the total number of layers would be 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, that was 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure that I correctly computed each layer without making a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression by expanding each layer, but that would take a lot of time and is prone to errors. The recurrence approach seems more efficient. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try computing a few layers manually again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all the steps check out. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 1, each step is 3*previous +1. But in this case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nWait, but in the recurrence relation, I considered a_1 = 4, which is correct because the innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each next layer is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so the recurrence is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the expression as starting with 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...), and so on, then each time we're adding another layer of 1 + 3*(...). So, the total number of layers is 9, as we have nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 1+3(...) in the original expression. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is the first layer.\n\n2. Then, moving out, the next is 1 + 3(...), which includes the first layer.\n\n3. Then another 1 + 3(...), including the previous two.\n\nContinuing this way, how many such layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the initial computation of 9 layers is correct.\n\nTherefore, using the recurrence relation, we found that a_9 = 29524, and 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. To be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually. Let's say Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer4.\n\nLayer4 was 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to 9 are correct. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since I'm working step by step, maybe it's easier to compute each layer as I did. But just to check, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without going through each layer. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for such equations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I went through each layer step by step, checked the computations, and then also derived a formula to compute the nth layer, which confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way out. After computing all layers, the final step is to multiply the result by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a derived formula, we confirm that the final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive formula where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, we can use the initial condition and the recurrence relation. Plugging in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, from the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Let's plug the general solution into this: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, we have: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: 3A + B = 4 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} to ensure that's correct. 3^1 =3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a recursive formula, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer. Let me think about it.\n\nEach time, the expression is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. It seems like a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to find the closed-form expression. Let's solve the recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, rewrite the recurrence: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstitute a_n^p into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9 for the innermost layer, but wait, actually, let's clarify: the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th layer. Wait, no, because each a_n corresponds to one layer, starting from a_1 as the innermost. So, in our original problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 would be the innermost, but actually, no, in our initial breakdown, a_1 was the innermost, so a_9 would be the outermost. Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, in our initial computation, we started with a_1 as the innermost, which was 1 + 3. Then a_2 was the next layer out, up to a_9 being the outermost. So, the entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer. That might have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute a few layers using the formula to see if they match.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the value of the ninth layer, which results in 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a recursive formula. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, yes, the same result. Alternatively, is there a formula for such a recurrence? Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, it's a geometric progression. The expression is essentially 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. So, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but since it's nested, it's a bit different. However, since we've already derived a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and we've confirmed it works, I think we're safe with the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors when multiplying 29524 by 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carry over 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation, and double-checking the multiplication, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated 9 times, resulting in the 9th layer being 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that I can recognize here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's similar to a geometric series but not exactly because each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, perhaps it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is computed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9, which is 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to derive it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the closed-form formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer. That might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, it's manageable either way. Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me recap: The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times ...))). By computing each layer step by step, I got to the innermost layer, computed each subsequent layer, and finally multiplied by 3. Alternatively, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form solution, I arrived at the same result. Both methods led me to the conclusion that the final answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer, leading to the final result of 29524 for the innermost expression in the outermost parentheses. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me add them step by step. 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 20 + 20 = 40, 4 + 4 = 8.

Hmm, but I feel like that's a very large number. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let's think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Correct. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct.

Let's recount each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, that seems correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps? Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is layer 9. So, the value of the outermost layer before multiplying by 3 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost layer is 29524, and then we multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just verify this with another approach to be absolutely sure. Alternatively, I can recognize that each time we're dealing with a geometric series. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression might give a geometric series. Let me try expanding the innermost parentheses first. Starting from the innermost: Let me denote the innermost expression as E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Then, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40 E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121 E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 = 364 E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the earlier results. Alternatively, using the formula I derived: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572, correct. Hmm, everything seems to add up. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but nested. Alternatively, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and such relations can often be solved using standard techniques. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*A - 1/2 => 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same answer without computing each layer individually, which is more efficient, especially if there were more layers. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, indeed, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using exponents without computing each layer. Since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost layer is a_9, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form formula. That's pretty cool. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation, we find that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe it's better to do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Next: 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I messed up the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 (carry) = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 has only 5 digits. Let me count: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying, we have:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 (tens) * 3 = 6 +1=7.\n\n5 (hundreds) *3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 (thousands) *3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 (ten thousands) *3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify with another method: 29524 * 3. 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nAdding units: 8 +4=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nTens: 4 +2=6 +1=7.\n\nHundreds: 0 +5=5.\n\nThousands: 9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1.\n\nTen thousands: 5 +2=7 +1=8.\n\nSo 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Therefore, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series with a common ratio of 3. Let me denote the innermost term as a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. Similarly, a3 =1 +3*a2=40, and so on. So each term is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation, and it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p =1 +3*a_p => a_p -3*a_p=1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n layers, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the result is 88572. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression as a sum, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with 9 layers. Each layer adds a term multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers. So, perhaps the sum can be expressed as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see: The innermost term is 1, then the next layer is 3*1, then 3^2*1, and so on, up to 3^9*1, but I think I need to adjust for the additions of 1 at each layer. Wait, perhaps it's better to see the total sum as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with 9 layers, which can be written as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with 8 layers, and so on. So, each layer adds another 3^k term. Let me think recursively. Let S(n) be the value of the expression with n layers. Then S(n) =3*(1 + S(n-1)). With S(1)=1 +3=4. Wait, but in our case, the expression is 3*(1 + S(n-1)), so S(n)=3*(1 + S(n-1)). Wait, but in our earlier computation, we had a1=4, a2=13, etc., which is similar to S(n)=3*(1 + S(n-1)). So, indeed, S(n)=3*(1 + S(n-1)). Therefore, the solution to this recurrence is S(n)= (3^{n+1} -3)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me solve S(n)=3*(1 + S(n-1)), with S(1)=3*(1 + S(0)). Wait, but S(0) would be the base case. If n=1, S(1)=3*(1 + S(0)). But S(1) is the innermost term: 3*(1 +3)=3*4=12? Wait, no, in our earlier computation, the innermost term was 1 +3=4, then multiplied by 3 gives 12, but in our problem, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +...)), so S(1)=3*(1 +3)=12, S(2)=3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39, but in our earlier step-by-step, a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, etc. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Let me define S(k) as the value after k layers, starting from the innermost. So, S(1)=1 +3=4. Then S(2)=1 +3*S(1)=1 +12=13. S(3)=1 +3*S(2)=1 +39=40, and so on. So, S(k)=1 +3*S(k-1), with S(1)=4. Then, the total expression is 3*S(9). So, solving S(k)=1 +3*S(k-1), S(1)=4. The solution to this recurrence is S(k)= (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Wait, because the homogeneous solution is C*3^k, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me solve it properly. The recurrence is S(k) -3*S(k-1)=1. The homogeneous solution is S_h(k)=C*3^k. For the particular solution, assume S_p(k)=A. Substituting: A -3*A=1 => -2A=1 => A=-1/2. So, the general solution is S(k)=C*3^k -1/2. Applying the initial condition S(1)=4: 4= C*3^1 -1/2 =>4=3C -1/2 =>3C=4 +1/2=9/2 =>C= (9/2)/3=3/2. Therefore, S(k)= (3/2)*3^k -1/2= (3^{k+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for k=9, S(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Therefore, the total expression is 3*S(9)=3*29524=88572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. I think I'm confident with this answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. So, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can express this recursively. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let me solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution, a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I can confidently say that the result is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the multiplication step. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 88572. Correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a linear recurrence relation. The innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. This leads to a general formula for the nth layer, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 3 * 29524 as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's see: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's consider the next term, n=2: L_2=13. Using the recurrence, L_2=1 + 3*L_1=1 + 12=13. Using the general solution, L_2=A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4, and 9A + B = 13. Let's subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for the first few layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same answer. That's reassuring. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula, I end up with 88572 as the final answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So, 88572. Hmm, but let me verify that 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. Alternatively, 30000 * 3 = 90000, so 29524 is 476 less than 30000. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back through my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if Layer 9 was miscalculated, then the final answer would be off. Let me recompute each layer step by step to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer checks out. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to be following the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, for each layer n, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, I think. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculations. Therefore, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the result is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step or applying the formula for the recurrence relation, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

So putting it all together: 6 8 8 5 2 2? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me write it out step by step.\n\nLet's compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7, no carry.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, it's 8 8 5 7 2.

Let me try again.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when I multiply by 3, starting from units:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 (tens) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens digit is 7, no carryover.\n\n5 (hundreds) * 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 (thousands) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands digit is 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 (ten thousands) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.

Yes, that's correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Let me double-check one or two layers to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's check Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, all the steps check out.

So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result again. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we determine that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carry over 1, write 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carry over 1, write 5. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry over 2, write 8. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. 9 * 3 = 27, carry over 2, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, carry over 1, write 7. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 9 * 3 = 27, carry over 2, write 7. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me try again, perhaps using a different approach. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose we define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. However, if I were to find a formula, it might be useful for larger numbers of layers. The recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, but starting from a_1 as the innermost. Let me check: a_1 = 4 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. a_2 = 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. a_3 = 40 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, indeed, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my previous calculation.

Wait, that can't be right because 3 * 29524 should be 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct). So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time and reduce errors. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 => A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 => A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Comparing both sides, we have B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about it. Since each layer is multiplied by 3 each time, it's a geometric progression. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me denote the innermost expression as x. Then, x = 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3x, and so on. But perhaps that's similar to the recurrence approach. Either way, I think the step-by-step computation and the formula both lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using a closed-form formula derived from this recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost expression and then compute the final result by multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression seems to be of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression. Suppose I define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I did earlier. So, in general, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me see: Let\u2019s assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n = k. Then, substituting into the recurrence: k = 1 + 3k => k - 3k = 1 => -2k = 1 => k = -1/2. So the particular solution is -1/2. Then, the homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I'm applying the formula correctly. Since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the result efficiently. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's model it mathematically. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recursive formula is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We also need another equation to solve for A and B. Let's consider n=0, although it's not part of the problem, but sometimes helps. However, in this case, n starts at 1, so maybe a different approach. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 \u2192 B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also leads us to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, which is a linear recurrence. The closed-form formula helps us avoid computing each layer manually, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent when computing a_n. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula lead to the same result, so I'm confident that this is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can check if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4, then each subsequent layer is built from the previous one. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, the solution is L_n = a*(b^{n-1} - 1)/(b - 1) + L_1*b^{n-1}. Wait, let me make sure. Let me consider the homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition, when n=1, L_1 =4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirmed the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by simplifying each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that again because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 more carefully: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that's correct. So the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer because sometimes when you compute nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then 3*29524 = 88,572 (correct). So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))). It looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me try to model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3a_9. So, we can see that each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we found before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. Yep, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then 3*29524 is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach time, it's 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, let's see: The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the total number of layers is 9, right? Because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, Layer 1:1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic root r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which confirms that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4.
