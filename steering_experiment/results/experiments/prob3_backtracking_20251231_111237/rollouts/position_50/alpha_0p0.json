    "text": " 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. There's nothing left, so the total is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1, digit 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, digit 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1, digit 5. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2, digit 8. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, digit 8. So, yes, it's 88572. Wait, but I'm getting confused because 29524 * 3 is 88572. But let me double-check that. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me go back and check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let's go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are growing so quickly, and I want to make sure I didn't skip a step or make a multiplication error. Let me verify the multiplication for Layer 9 again: 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3 again: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but I just realized that the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which means that after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I multiply that by 3 to get the final result. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I went through each layer step by step, and each multiplication seems accurate. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n10. **Final Result**: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because that seems a bit off. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88572. Hmm, but let me verify that because 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step because that's a lot of layers, and it's easy to miscalculate somewhere. Let's recheck each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer checks out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if I can model this with a formula. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nFor each subsequent layer, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a + r*L_{n-1}, where a=1 and r=3.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and the solution can be found using the formula for such a recurrence.\n\nThe formula for L_n is L_n = a*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + (L_1 - a)/(r - 1)*r^{n-1}.\n\nWait, actually, let me recall the standard solution for a linear recurrence like L_n = a + r*L_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*r^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = a + r*K => K - r*K = a => K(1 - r) = a => K = a/(1 - r).\n\nBut since r \u2260 1, this works.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*r^n + a/(1 - r).\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = C*r^1 + a/(1 - r) => 4 = C*3 + 1/(1 - 3) => 4 = 3C + 1/(-2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer is L_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods\u2014direct computation and the formula derived from the recurrence relation\u2014I arrive at the same answer. This gives me confidence that the solution is correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric progression, where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. So, the expression can be seen as a sum of a geometric series. However, in this case, since each term is nested within the next, the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward. In any case, after careful step-by-step computation and verification, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve this, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Use the result to compute the next layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3 * 4 = 13\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3 * 13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3 * 40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3 * 121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3 * 364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3 * 1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3 * 3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3 * 9841 = 29524\n\n4. Finally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nThus, the computed value of the expression is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again because I think I messed up the digits. Let me write it out step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, but when I did it in my head earlier, I thought of 29524 * 3 as 88572, which seems correct. Wait, but earlier when I broke it down, I thought 3*29524 is 88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in calculating one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, so each layer checks out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without labeling the layers. Let me try that approach. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out one layer, we have 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 40. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 121. Then: 1 + 3*(121) = 364. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093. Then: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841. Then: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. So, the step-by-step process is: Start from the innermost parentheses and work outward, computing each layer by substituting the inner value into the outer expression, multiplying by 3 each time, and adding 1. After computing the innermost nine layers, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed and substituted into the next. After computing all nine layers, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Substitute into the next layer:\n   Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Continue substituting:\n   Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. Multiply the final layer by 3:\n   3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3 \u00d7 29524 should be 88572, but let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Is that correct? Let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes, so each layer seems correct. Therefore, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, and going out to Layer 9, which is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. So, yes, the outermost expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524, giving 88572. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, computing each one is manageable. However, if there were more layers, it might be better to find a recursive formula or use geometric series.\n\nWait, let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method also leads to the same answer, which is reassuring.

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3: Let me check again. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check once more because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to miscount or make a multiplication error. Let me try computing the layers again, but this time, maybe I'll write each step clearly. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As before, 29524*3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, each layer's value is computed step by step. Recognizing the recurrence relation allows us to derive a closed-form formula, confirming the result. The final computation gives:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. But let me go back and make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or recognize a pattern. Let me see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me test it with n=1: a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. According to the formula, (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Formula: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Similarly, n=3: a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, it seems that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, let me check: For n=1, a_1=4, which is (3^{2} -1)/2=4. For n=2, a_2=13=(3^3 -1)/2=13. So, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the innermost layer, but wait, actually, in the problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1, and Layer 9 would be n=9. Wait, no, actually, in the problem, the innermost parentheses is Layer 1, which is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, if we have nine layers, then Layer 9 would be the outermost one, which is the result before multiplying by the outermost 3. Wait, no, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I have Layer 1 to Layer 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), then Layer 9 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Multiply by 3:29524*3=88572. Yep, that all checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find the value of each layer step by step. Using the recurrence relation and recognizing the pattern, we determine that the value of the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For Layer 9, this gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me count the digits: 2 (1), 9 (2), 5 (3), 2 (4), 4 (5).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually.

Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution, a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1 = 59,048. Divided by 2: 59,048 /2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\).

Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.

Let me try again. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. The next digit is 9 (from 29524), which is the ten-thousands place, so 9 * 3 = 27, but wait, I think I missed a digit. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4. If I can find a closed-form formula for L_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer step by step. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find the value of each layer step by step. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed accordingly until the outermost layer is reached. Multiplying this final layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28.

Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to be absolutely certain, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final result is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistake in the layers, let me recount each step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, I think I've computed it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series, perhaps? Let me consider that.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n...\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general form for such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n - 1} + c/(1 - r), provided that r \u2260 1.\n\nWait, let me verify that formula. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = c + r*K => K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r).\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*r^{n} + K. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*r^{1} + K => 4 = A*r + K.\n\nBut K = c/(1 - r) = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3 + (-1/2) => A*3 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} + (-1/2).\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n + 1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n + 1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for a_9, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed before.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost term, each layer adds a term that's 3^n, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the expression can be expanded as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times, leading to a sum of 3^k for k from 1 to 9, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try expanding it.\n\nWait, let's consider that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. If I expand a_9, it would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to 9 layers. So, in terms of expansion, a_9 = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Because each time you have a 1 multiplied by 3^k, where k increases by 1 each layer. So, a_9 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k. Because starting from k=0 (which is 1) up to k=8.\n\nWait, but let's check:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\na_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 3 + 3^2\na_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3\n...\na_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3^1 = 4, which is sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4. Similarly, a_2 is 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 13, which is sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. So, indeed, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nBut wait, in our case, we have a_9 = sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k. Wait, but earlier we found a_9 = 29524, and sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is exactly what we had. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or recognize it as a geometric series sum, I arrive at the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result to ensure accuracy.\n\n3. Notice a pattern that could be modeled using a geometric series and a recurrence relation.\n\n4. Derive a closed-form formula for the nth term, confirming it with known values.\n\n5. Apply the formula to compute the 9th term, then multiply by 3.\n\n6.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let's see. The recursive relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let me also compute a few more terms to see the pattern. a_2 = 13, a_3=40, a_4=121, etc. Let me plug in n=1: 4 = 3A + B. Let's also compute a_2: a_2 = 3*a_1 + 1 = 3*4 +1 =13. Using the general solution for n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B =13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B =4 and 9A + B=13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) =13 -4 => 6A=9 => A=9/6=3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B=4 => 9/2 + B=4 => B=4 -9/2= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was just starting out, breaking it down step by step was a good approach to avoid mistakes. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using the recursive formula \\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\), we compute each layer up to the ninth layer. \n\nThe ninth layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me verify by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841. Let me confirm that 3*9841 is indeed 29523, and adding 1 gives 29524. Yes, that's correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, I think I might have missed a layer. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+\" is a new layer. Let me count: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds another layer. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3: Layer 1. Then each next layer is 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of \"1+\" terms: There's one at the innermost, then each time we go out, another \"1+\". So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then 1+3(...), and so on, until the outermost. Let me count the number of \"1+\"s: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many times does \"1+\" appear? Let me see: The innermost is 1+3. Then moving out, each time, another 1+3(...). So, how many layers? Let me write them down:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n...\nEach layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end. The original expression ends with nine closing parentheses: )))))))))) So, that's nine closing parentheses, meaning there are nine layers. So, Layer 1: 1+3=4\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which is correct because 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the 9th layer is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I've got it right. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we find the value of the innermost expression to be 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all the layers because if I made a mistake in one layer, the entire calculation would be off. Let me go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 Correct. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if there's a formula I can apply here. The expression can be represented as 3 * (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))), which is a nested multiplication. Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio, but in this case, it's nested, so it's a bit different. Let me try to model it. Let's denote the innermost expression as a1: a1 = 1 + 3 Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on up to a9, which is the outermost expression. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. Since each a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting from a1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^n - 1)/2, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Wait, let me test that. If a1 = 4, which is (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, correct. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13, correct. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40, correct. So, the pattern seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ). But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The number of layers is 9, starting from a1 to a9, each defined as a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a1 = 1 + 3. So, indeed, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, that's another way to approach it without computing each layer step by step, which is faster and reduces the chance of error. But since I already did the step-by-step and got the same result, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again quickly. a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572 Yep, that's consistent. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.\n\nLet me go back and verify each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, does the expression start with 3 times the first layer, which is Layer 9? Let me make sure I understood the structure correctly.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, the outermost expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times ( ... )). So, yes, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. Let's count the number of 3(1+3(...)) segments.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3(1+3)\n2. 3(1+3(1+3))\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n... and so on until the outermost expression has nine layers.\n\nWait, so when I labeled Layer 1 as 1+3, that's the innermost. Then Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer 1), which is 1+3*4=13, and so on up to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression inside the first 3(...). So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe using a formula for such a nested expression. I notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because a_1 corresponds to n=1, so a_9 would be n=9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the number of layers is indeed 9. Looking back at the original expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer, and the closing parentheses come after each. Let's count the number of 3(...):\n\nStarting from the outermost:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n...\nContinuing until the innermost is 1+3.\n\nSo, from the expression, I can see that there are 9 instances of 3(1+3(...)). So, n=9, which gives us a_9 as computed.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer checks out. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation method gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 3 multiplied by a sum of 1 and another nested expression. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation approach confirms the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, which might make this easier in case I have to compute something similar in the future. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such expressions. Suppose I have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers. Then, each layer can be represented recursively. Let me define L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I calculated earlier. So, in general, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2192 Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers in the original problem, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, the total expression is 3 * L(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.

    "text": " 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the outermost layer is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, adding up each part: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach. I remember that expressions like this, with repeated multiplication, can sometimes be represented using a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_1 to a_9 again using this notation: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9, so plugging n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it multiple ways: computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation, and deriving a general formula. All methods lead to the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helped. I was worried about making an arithmetic error, especially with such large numbers, but rechecking each step and using the general formula gave me the same answer, so I think it's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because when I compute 29524 * 3, I should get 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go through each layer again to make sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct.

Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then the total expression is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let's find A and B. From the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, substituting into the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Comparing both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + (1 + 3B). Therefore, B = 1 + 3B => 0 = 1 + 2B => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outer expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times ...), so after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we multiply by 3, which gives 88572. That seems right.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it step by step again, just in case I made a calculation error in one of the layers.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, starting from n1 = 4, then n2 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13, n3 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40, and so on.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me denote a_k as the value at layer k. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc.\n\nLooking at the values:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 13\n\na_3 = 40\n\na_4 = 121\n\na_5 = 364\n\na_6 = 1093\n\na_7 = 3280\n\na_8 = 9841\n\na_9 = 29524\n\nHmm, I wonder if there's a formula for a_k. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nGiven a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_k = 3*a_{k-1}, which has the solution a_k^{(h)} = C*3^{k}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_k^{(p)} = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1\n\n-2D = 1\n\nD = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_k = C*3^{k} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say k=1 corresponds to a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when k=1: a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I have.\n\nFor k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=4: a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for layer k, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Expression:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me try again more carefully:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.

Write down 8, no carry.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying:\n\nStarting from units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Thousands digit: 8, carryover: 2.\n\nTen thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten thousands digit: 8.\n\nSo putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, but 29524 * 3 = 88,572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572. Wait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I got Layer 9 as 29,524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, yes, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is built by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, which seems to follow a geometric progression pattern. Alternatively, recognizing that each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = 3^{n} + (something). But since we're dealing with a finite number of layers (9 layers), computing each step manually is feasible, and as I did, it leads to 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition.

Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see if I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the non-homogeneous part is the constant term 1. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also leads me to the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me see if that approach works. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer adds another power of 3. So, the total number of multiplications by 3 is 9, but I need to be careful because each layer is nested within the previous one. Using the closed-form formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is 3 times the sum of 3^k from k=0 to k=9, but I need to adjust for the 1s in each layer. Wait, actually, the expression is more like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This is similar to a geometric series where each term is 3^n. Let me try to express it as such. Let me denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me see if I can express S in terms of itself. Wait, but since there are nine layers, it's a finite series, so maybe I can find a formula for finite n. Alternatively, I can consider that each layer adds another term, so after n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we found earlier. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. I think this is solidifying my confidence in the answer. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 manually: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 digit by digit:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think I've verified it multiple times using different methods: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This forms a recurrence relation which can be solved to find the value at each layer. The outermost layer is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation confirms the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct). Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. Either way, I get the same answer.

To find B, we can solve for the steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = B. So, B = 1 + 3*B \u21d2 B - 3B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, so the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.

Each layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, each step is straightforward. Then, the outermost expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression step by step again, but this time, maybe write down all the layers in order without skipping steps. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, if I can find a general formula for L_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer. Let's try to find a pattern or a formula for L_n. Let's compute the first few layers to see if we can spot a pattern.\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nI wonder if there's a pattern or a formula for L_n. Let's see:\n\nEach L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + (b/(a - 1))*(a^n - 1), where L_0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, in this case, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, since each time we have 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, a = 3, b = 1.\n\nSo, the general solution would be L_n = 3^n * L_0 + (1/(3 - 1))*(3^n - 1) = 3^n * L_0 + (1/2)*(3^n - 1)\n\nBut wait, what is L_0? In our case, L_1 is the first term, which is 4. So, perhaps we need to adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of L_n as starting from n=1, where L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let's test that.\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but L_1 is 4, so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me compute the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for our problem, since we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in our earlier computation, L_1 was the innermost layer, which corresponds to n=1. So, the outermost layer is L_9, which would correspond to n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9 as 29524. Let me go back and check each layer computation again because if I messed up one layer, the entire result will be wrong.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 is the outermost, and then we multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or formula. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Wait, let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a_n as the value at the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, which might help in computing a_9 without having to compute each layer step by step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 \u2192 -2*A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u2192 9/2 = 3C \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for a_9, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the original expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the general formula applies correctly. Since the initial condition was a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1, then the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 holds for n \u2265 1. So, for n=9, it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer adds a term that's a multiple of 3, leading to a geometric progression. So, the total expression can be expressed as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to 9 layers, which we've now confirmed through two methods: iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure consistency.\n\nUsing a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2713\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2713\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2713\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2713\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2713\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2713\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2713\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2713\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2713\n\nAll correct. So, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer.

So when I multiply by 3, I should only have 29524 * 3.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7, write 7, carryover 0.\n- 5 *3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 *3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 *3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo reading from top to bottom, it's 8 (from the ten thousands place), then 8, then 8, then 5, then 7, then 2.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572, which seems correct. Hmm, but let me double-check the multiplication of 3*29524 to ensure I didn't make a mistake there. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 3*3=9. So writing it down: 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I did that correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to make sure, let me recount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1:1+3. Then Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer 1). So, each time, we're adding a layer by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, if I have nine layers, each computed as 1 + 3*previous layer, then the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, Layer 1:4, Layer 2:13, Layer 3:40, Layer 4:121, Layer 5:364, Layer 6:1093, Layer 7:3280, Layer 8:9841, Layer 9:29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572, as before. So, using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation approach, we arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Therefore, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step and applying the recurrence relation, we find that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct) Okay, that seems consistent. Each step builds upon the previous one, and the multiplications and additions look correct. So, I think my approach is right. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Wait, since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me see: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 Hmm, let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. It seems like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since our expression has 9 layers, that would correspond to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. But since I was able to compute it step by step without errors, and the formula confirms the result, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

Let me check 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost part, each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier terms. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, a_9 =29524, and the final answer is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, since the final answer is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form formula. Either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time if the expression were longer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. So, equation (1): 3A + B = 4. Now, since the recurrence is homogeneous, the particular solution is a constant, so B is a constant. Let me assume that the solution is L_n = A*3^n + C. Wait, maybe I should use a different approach. Alternatively, since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous, I can write it as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let me unroll the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}. Wait, that seems like a geometric series. Let me check: L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13? Wait, 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, yes. L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Wait, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. But 3^3 is 27, so L_3 would be 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Similarly, L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. So, it's looking like L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but starting from k=0? Wait, no, because L_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3 = 4, which is sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4. Similarly, L_2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is sum_{k=0}^{2} 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. So, in general, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. But the sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r = 3, so sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in the original problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let's see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, moving out, each time we have another 1+3(...), so Layer 2, Layer 3, etc. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses: After the first 3, we have (1+3(...)), and each time, another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: The first layer is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then, moving out, Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1+3*(Layer 2). And so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost. Wait, but in the expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, each time we have another 1+3*(...), so Layer 2, Layer 3, etc. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) in the entire expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time we have another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term. Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1+3(Layer 8)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers in total. Therefore, Layer 9 = L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when I computed Layer 9 manually. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the geometric series, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yeah, that checks out. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct.

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition: When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for the recurrence relation L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier, so that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula for a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand it, the entire expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). It's a bit tricky, but using the recurrence relation seems more straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding it. Let's denote the innermost term as T = 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 1 + 3*T, where T is the previous layer. So, after expanding all layers, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Let me try to see the pattern. Each time, you're adding a 1 and multiplying by 3. So, after n layers, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with n layers. From earlier, we found that L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. I can compute 3^10 step by step to confirm. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 Correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Then, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct. So, the final answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So putting it all together, starting from the right: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8, 7, 2, 8, 8. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should just do it step by step. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this problem as a geometric series because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me see if that approach gives the same result. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula for the geometric series, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers.
