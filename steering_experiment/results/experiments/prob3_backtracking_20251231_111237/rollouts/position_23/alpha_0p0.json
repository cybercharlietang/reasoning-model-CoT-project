    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that's manageable. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wow, these numbers are increasing rapidly. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Okay, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems really big. Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so the formula works. Therefore, the value of Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and the outermost layer is Layer 9. Wait, but in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, let me make sure: The expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Because 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that seems manageable. Let's go to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, so each time, we're taking the previous layer's result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. So, this is a recursive pattern where each layer depends on the previous one. Let me try to formalize this a bit. Let\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nL_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nL_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, let me check that. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, starting from L_1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, let me make sure I'm calculating each correctly.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, hold on, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, plus 3=363. So, 363 +1=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1092 +1=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 3279 +1=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 +600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 9840 +1=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer seems to be calculated correctly. Now, after computing all layers up to L9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(L9). Let me check the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So yes, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, the total expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding these up: 60000 +27000=87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from L1 to L9, each step seems correct. Each L_n is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and each multiplication and addition checks out. Then, multiplying L9 by 3 gives 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. The recursion is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 +1/2 = 3A => 9/2 =3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for n=9, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 27? Wait, maybe I messed up the digit places.\n\nWait, let's write it out properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 *3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 *3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 *3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 *3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 *3=27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 *3=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 7 7 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3 is 88572. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nUnits place: 4*3=12. Write 2, carry 1.\nTens place: 2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\nHundreds place: 5*3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\nThousands place: 2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\nTen-thousands place: 9*3=27. Write 7, carry 2.\nHundred-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 7 7 5 7 2. Wait, that's 877572? That can't be right because 29524*3 is 88572. I must have misaligned the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n   29524\n*     3\n--------\n      2 (from 4*3)\n     7  (from 2*3 +1)\n    5  (from 5*3)\n   7  (from 2*3 +1)\n 8  (from 9*3 +2)\n2  (from 2*3 +2)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Actually, when multiplying, each digit's product is written in its place. Let me do it step by step:\n\nMultiply 29524 by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place):5*3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place):2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit (ten-thousands place):9*3=27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (hundred-thousands place):2*3=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 7 7 5 7 2, but that would be 877572, which is way too big because 29524*3 should be around 88,572. Wait, I think I messed up the digit placement. Let me write it with proper alignment:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   *       3\n   -----------\n       8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, how?\n\nWait, actually, when multiplying 29524 by 3:\n\n- 4 *3=12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 *3=6 +1=7. Tens place:7.\n- 5 *3=15. Hundreds place:5, carryover 1.\n- 2 *3=6 +1=7. Thousands place:7.\n- 9 *3=27. Ten-thousands place:7, carryover 2.\n- 2 *3=6 +2=8. Hundred-thousands place:8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,7,7,8. Wait, that's 877572, but that's not correct because 29524*3=88572. Wait, I think I'm miscounting the digits. Let's see:\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12. Units digit:2, carryover 1.\n- Tens:2*3=6 +1=7. Tens digit:7.\n- Hundreds:5*3=15. Hundreds digit:5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28. Thousands digit:8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands:2*3=6 +2=8. Ten-thousands digit:8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572. There we go. I think I was misaligning the digits earlier. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer is reached. Multiplying the result of the outermost layer by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses, the entire expression is 3 times that value. So, the final computation would be: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29000*3 = 87000, 524*3 = 1572. So, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without manually calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. However, just for practice, let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula that could represent this. Looking at the layers, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). This is a recursive relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 /2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute the result without having to calculate each layer step by step, which is much more efficient, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine, it's manageable either way. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step method and the formula approach gave me the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3 = (20,000 * 3) + (9,000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 72 = 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500. 88,500 + 72 is 88,572. So, the total is 88,572. Wait, let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I do a lot of steps, I might miscalculate a layer.

So, it's 88,572. Yep, that seems right. I think I did that correctly. So, each layer builds upon the previous one, and by methodically computing each step, I arrived at the final answer. It's a bit tedious, but breaking it down made it manageable. I guess the key here was recognizing the pattern and working from the inside out. If I tried to compute it from the outside in, it might get too complicated with too many nested operations. So, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward was the right approach. I also had to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way because each layer depends on the previous one. It's easy to slip up with multiplication or addition, especially with larger numbers, but taking it step by step and double-checking each layer helped prevent mistakes.

I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. First, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern allowed me to derive a formula, which can be really helpful for more complex or deeper nested expressions. In this case, since there were only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, but having a formula is a good check and can save time if the number of layers increases. I think I've got this.

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just go through my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74=13. Layer 3:1 + 3\u00d713=40. Layer 4:1 + 3\u00d740=121. Layer 5:1 + 3\u00d7121=364. Layer 6:1 + 3\u00d7364=1093. Layer 7:1 + 3\u00d71093=3280. Layer 8:1 + 3\u00d73280=9841. Layer 9:1 + 3\u00d79841=29524. Then, 3\u00d729524=88572. Each step seems correct. I think I did it right.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me just verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Let me check each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's right. Each layer builds on the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which creates a rapidly increasing sequence. Starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3 times the previous plus 1. It's interesting how quickly these numbers grow. So, after nine layers, we end up with 29,524 before multiplying by the outermost 3, which brings us to 88,572. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Each subsequent layer is computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and using that result for the next layer.\n3. After computing each layer up to the ninth layer, we get the result 29,524.\n4. Finally, multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nThe step-by-step computation is as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let's compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so starting from the innermost, I computed up to Layer 9, which is correct. So, each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It might be similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n-1} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{0} + B => 4 = A + B.\n\nNow, let's find another equation to solve for A and B. Let's compute a_2 using the recurrence:\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the closed-form expression, a_2 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B.\n\nSo, 13 = 3A + B.\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1) A + B = 4\n\n2) 3A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(3A + B) - (A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n2A = 9 => A = 9/2 = 4.5\n\nThen, from equation 1, 4.5 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 4.5 = -0.5\n\nSo, the closed-form expression is a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\na_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2.\n\nAlternatively, since 9 is 3^2, we can write this as a_n = (3^{2}*3^{n-1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n3^{2} * 3^{n-1} = 3^{2 + n -1} = 3^{n+1}\n\nSo, yes, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each layer manually or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same answer. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\), and each subsequent layer is computed as \\( a_{n+1} = 1 + 3a_n \\).\n\n1.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280.

Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let me break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, 29524 is 29,524, which is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24. So, 3*20,000 = 60,000, 3*9,000 = 27,000, 3*500 = 1,500, and 3*24 = 72. Now, adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Hmm, that seems pretty big, but considering each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's growing exponentially. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. We know that a_1 = 4. Plugging into the equation: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate, but since each a_n is finite, perhaps B is a constant term. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation step by step. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's unroll the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this way, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. But in our case, a_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. Wait, actually, if we consider a_0, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. But in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3, so a_0 would be 1? Wait, maybe not. Let's try to see. If we consider a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, then a_1 = 4, so 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. So, a_0 = 1, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. So, the general formula would be a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=0: (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. Correct, a_0 = 1. For n=1: (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct, a_1 = 4. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13. Correct, a_2 = 13. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40. Correct, a_3 = 40. So, yes, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works for each layer. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10 first. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as Layer 9 we computed earlier. So, that checks out. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. Just to recap, the process was: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result. 3. Notice a pattern that each layer follows a recurrence relation, which can be solved with a formula. 4. Verify the formula with known values to ensure correctness. 5. Use the formula to compute the outermost layer, then multiply by 3 for the final result. This methodical approach helps prevent mistakes and ensures that each step is correct before moving on. It's also useful to see how the problem can be modeled with a recurrence relation, which is a common technique in mathematics and computer science for solving nested or iterative problems. I think that's all there is to it. The answer seems solid after both the step-by-step computation and the verification using the formula.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Well, 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer: 1 + 3*previous. So, 1 + 3*4 = 13, 1 + 3*13 = 40, 1 + 3*40 = 121, 1 + 3*121 = 364, 1 + 3*364 = 1093, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Let me check one more step to be thorough. Let's say Layer 7 is 3280. Then Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Then Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did it right. Each step builds on the previous one, and I didn't see any errors in my calculations. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, the final step is to compute: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me verify the multiplication step again because that's where I might have made an error. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yeah, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but I just thought of something. Did I count the layers correctly? Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time we have a 1 + 3(...), that's a new layer. Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3, so let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of \"1+3\" before each closing parenthesis. From the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time we go out, we have another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, we have 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, layer 1: innermost 1+3, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So, yes, I computed up to layer 9, which gives 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, but wait, when I computed layer 9, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check each layer again to ensure accuracy. Let's go step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are growing so quickly. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could help me compute this without manually calculating each layer. Maybe a geometric series or something like that. Let's see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B, then:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. So, the 9th layer is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the recurrence relation approach. I derived the closed-form solution, and it worked for the initial layers. Let me test it for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, I can trust that a_9=29524, and the final result is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough steps, and everything seems consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.

Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, yes. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let's think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We need another equation to find A and B. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 3*L_1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. Using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from L_1) 9A + B = 13 (from L_2) Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: L_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that's the same result as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me verify that because I might have made a mistake in the calculations. Let me check each layer again to ensure I didn't make any errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27. Wait, actually, that's when multiplying digit by digit, but maybe a better way is to break it down as I did before. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's it. It took a while, but by breaking down each layer and computing step by step, I arrived at the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the innermost parentheses first and working outward.

I can break this down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, the total is 88,572.

Wait, just to make sure, let me recompute Layer 9 and the final multiplication. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280 first. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840.

Yes, that seems correct. So, each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572. I think that's the answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without doing each layer manually. Let's see, the expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. That looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's actually a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then each a_n is defined recursively. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, set the left and right sides equal: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, matches our earlier calculation. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. It's good to know both methods: step-by-step computation and finding a formula when possible. In this case, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allowed me to find a closed-form solution, which can save time in the future for similar problems. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer. 2. Compute each layer step by step, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. 3. After computing all nine layers, multiply the result by 3. 4. Verify the result using an alternative method (closed-form formula) to ensure correctness. Both methods led to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, we have 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems right. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Yep. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Wait, 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093. That's correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 is 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost 3 times Layer 9: 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Hmm, that seems pretty big, but given the number of layers, each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's going to grow exponentially. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result without computing each layer step by step. That was a good exercise. It shows how recognizing a pattern and using recurrence relations can simplify the problem-solving process, especially when dealing with nested structures like this. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me compute one more layer using the formula to ensure it's consistent. Let's take n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Which is exactly what I calculated manually. So, the formula holds. Therefore, using the formula, I can compute any layer quickly, which is efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable either way. I think I've covered all the steps and verified the result through multiple methods. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel good about the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By recognizing this recurrence relation, we can derive a general formula for each layer, which is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). \n\nFor the given problem with 9 layers, the outermost layer is \\( a_9 \\):\n\n\\[\na_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n\\]\n\nMultiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's the right answer, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, recognizing a geometric series or a recursive pattern can make the calculation easier, especially if there are many layers. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n, which might help avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if there are many layers. The recurrence relation is: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to make sure it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the formula confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to recap, I first computed each layer step by step, which worked but was time-consuming. Then, I recognized the recurrence relation and found a general formula, which not only confirmed the result but also could be used for any number of layers, which is pretty cool. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a recurrence pattern. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By solving the recurrence relation, we find a general formula for each layer, which simplifies the computation. The final result is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 is a bit large. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. That seems correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a certain sequence. Let me check if the numbers I obtained make sense. Starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, each number is roughly 3 times the previous plus 1. For example, 4*3 +1=13, 13*3 +1=40, 40*3 +1=121, etc. So, that seems to be the pattern. So, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. Therefore, each layer can be calculated as 3*(previous layer) +1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3*previous +1. Let me see: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 3*4 +1=13 Layer 3: 3*13 +1=40 Layer 4: 3*40 +1=121 Layer 5: 3*121 +1=364 Layer 6: 3*364 +1=1093 Layer 7: 3*1093 +1=3280 Layer 8: 3*3280 +1=9841 Layer 9: 3*9841 +1=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but each term is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me try to model this. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is known. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, we have n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute this without having to go through each layer step by step. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's correct. I can't spot any errors in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give me the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final computation would be 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number, but let me check if I did each step correctly. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Now, 3*29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can compute it as (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Either way, it checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here that I can recognize? Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model it as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term. Let's see, if I define a_n as the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations because both methods led to the same answer, and I double-checked each step when I went through the layers again. So, I'm pretty sure the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have given me this result without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is defined recursively. This seems like a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence, I can recognize it as a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572. It's a bit tedious to compute each layer, but using the recursive formula and the closed-form expression, I arrived at the same answer both ways, so I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that because the original expression is 3 times the outermost layer, which is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or use a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. I notice that each L_n seems to be following a pattern similar to powers of 3, but let me check. Let's see: L_1 = 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1. L_2 = 13 = 3*4 + 1 = 3*(3 + 1) + 1 = 3^2 + 3 + 1. L_3 = 40 = 3*13 + 1 = 3*(3^2 + 3 + 1) + 1 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1. Hmm, that's interesting. So, L_n = 3^n + 3^(n-1) + ... + 3 + 1, which is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series is given by S = (r^(n+1) - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r = 3, so S = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For L_1: n=1, S=(3^(2)-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches. For L_2: n=2, S=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches. For L_3: n=3, S=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40, which matches. So, yes, L_n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula for L_n, since L_n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^10 - 1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Calculating 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524. Well, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L1. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous, so we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial conditions to find A and B. For n = 1: L1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n = 2: L2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we have a system of two equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 \u21d2 6A = 9 \u21d2 A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 \u21d2 9/2 + B = 4 \u21d2 B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to ensure it's correct. For n = 1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n = 9, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I were to write a program or use a calculator, I could compute each layer iteratively, but since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), doing it manually isn't too bad. However, if there were more layers, the closed-form formula would be much more efficient. In any case, after carefully computing each step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each time I compute a layer, I take the previous result, multiply by 3, add 1, and that becomes the next layer's value. Let me write this down more systematically. Let me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, the outermost operation is multiplying the result of L9 by 3. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from L1 to L9: L1 = 4, correct. L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I could compute 29524*3 by multiplying each digit: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 8*3=24 +2=26, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2; 8*3=24 +2=26, write 6, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, that seems a bit messy, but when I write it out, it's 88572. So, that matches my previous calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated until the outermost layer is reached, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer Starting from the Innermost**:\n   - **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3**:\n   - Final result = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841.

Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So we have 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which we just found to be 29524. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).

Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9: 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, 3*4 = 12. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication and addition, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (That's correct.) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct.) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Still correct.) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Right.) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Yes.) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct.) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Yes.) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Right.) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Yes, that's correct.) So, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me think again. Is there a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this instead of computing each layer step by step? Because computing each layer manually can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula here. Each layer seems to follow the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can express this in terms of a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's try to model this. Let's denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers from 1 to 9. We have L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, etc., as computed before. The recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1 for n >= 2. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. For n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L9, is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572. Wait, but let me think again. Is that the correct approach? Because the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*Layer9, yes. Alternatively, maybe I can model the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. Let's denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) If I let the innermost expression be x =1 +3, then each layer is 1 +3*x, where x is the next layer. So, working from the inside out, we can compute each layer as before. Alternatively, since we found a closed-form for Layer n, which is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then Layer9 is (3^{10}-1)/2=29524. So, E=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe we can express E in terms of a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. Let's write E as:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this expression step by step:\n\nStart from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLet\u2019s define each nested part:\n\nLet\u2019s define a1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\nThen, a2 =1 +3*a1=1 +12=13\n\na3=1+3*a2=1+39=40\n\na4=1+3*a3=1+120=121\n\na5=1+3*a4=1+363=364\n\na6=1+3*a5=1+1092=1093\n\na7=1+3*a6=1+3279=3280\n\na8=1+3*a7=1+9840=9841\n\na9=1+3*a8=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, E=3*a9=3*29524=88572\n\nAlternatively, using the formula we derived earlier, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2= (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Therefore, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me try to see if there's another way to compute this without computing each layer, perhaps by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost:\n\na1=1+3=4\n\na2=1+3*a1=1+3*4=13\n\na3=1+3*a2=1+3*13=40\n\n...\n\nEach a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, which we've already solved. So, the closed-form is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nLet me try expanding E:\n\nE=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this expression by substituting each layer:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s compute the innermost part first: 1+3=4\n\nThen, moving out one layer:1+3*(4)=13\n\nNext layer:1+3*(13)=40\n\nNext:1+3*(40)=121\n\nNext:1+3*(121)=364\n\nNext:1+3*(364)=1093\n\nNext:1+3*(1093)=3280\n\nNext:1+3*(3280)=9841\n\nNext:1+3*(9841)=29524\n\nThen, E=3*(29524)=88572\n\nSo, that's the same result as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can see the entire expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me try to express E in terms of a sum:\n\nE=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this expression:\n\nE=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me work from the innermost parentheses outward, which we've already done, but perhaps writing it as a sum:\n\nEach time, we have 1 added, and each subsequent term is multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nAt the innermost layer, it's 1 +3=4\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 +3*4=13\n\nThen, 1 +3*13=40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, in terms of a series, each term is 1, but multiplied by 3 multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an added 1 each time.\n\nWait, but perhaps if we consider the entire expression, it's similar to 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... +3^9, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me try to express E as follows:\n\nE=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to expand this expression step by step, but in terms of powers of 3:\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a1=1+3=4\n\na2=1 +3*a1=1 +3*4=13\n\na3=1 +3*a2=1 +3*13=40\n\na4=1 +3*a3=1 +3*40=121\n\na5=1 +3*a4=1 +3*121=364\n\na6=1 +3*a5=1 +3*364=1093\n\na7=1 +3*a6=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na8=1 +3*a7=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na9=1 +3*a8=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, E=3*a9=3*29524=88572\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write E as a sum:\n\nE=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this step by step:\n\nStart from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost part is (1 +3)=4\n\nThen, moving out one layer: (1 +3*4)=13\n\nNext layer: (1 +3*13)=40\n\nNext: (1 +3*40)=121\n\nNext: (1 +3*121)=364\n\nNext: (1 +3*364)=1093\n\nNext: (1 +3*1093)=3280\n\nNext: (1 +3*3280)=9841\n\nNext: (1 +3*9841)=29524\n\nThen, E=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with our previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a sum of a geometric series with ratio 3. Let's see:\n\nEach time, we have a term that's 1, and each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, perhaps the entire expression can be written as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3)...)))\n\nBut in this case, since each layer is 1 +3*(next layer), it's a bit more complex than a simple geometric series. However, using the closed-form formula we derived earlier, we can compute each layer quickly.\n\nSo, using the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost.\n\nThus, for layer 9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the exponent in the formula. Since a1 corresponds to n=1, and a1=4, which is (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct. So, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum where each term is 3^k, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Let me try:\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer adds another power of 3. So, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost layer:\n\na1=4=3 +1=3^1 +1\n\na2=13=3*(3 +1) +1=3^2 +3 +1\n\na3=40=3*(3^2 +3 +1) +1=3^3 +3^2 +3 +1\n\nSimilarly, each layer a_n=3^{n} +3^{n-1} +...+3^1 +1\n\nWhich is a geometric series with ratio 3, from k=1 to k=n.\n\nSo, the sum is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, which matches our earlier formula.\n\nTherefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 27. Wait, no, let me do it properly:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write 27.\n\nWait, that would be 88572.\n\nYes, 29524*3=88572.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can derive a closed-form formula to compute each layer efficiently. Each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
