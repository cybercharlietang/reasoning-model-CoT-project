Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's do this step by step. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, the result is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made an error in multiplying or adding. Let me verify each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 * 3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3 * 29,524. Let's compute that again: 29,524 * 3. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. But wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way, perhaps looking for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me consider that each layer is defined by a recurrence. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can find a closed-form expression. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59,049. So, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my previous result. Alternatively, if I use the closed-form expression, I can compute L_9 directly without going through each layer, which is more efficient and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence pattern, we can derive a closed-form solution. Each layer follows the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\), leading to the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this for the outermost layer and multiplying by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\) the next layer.\n2. **Define the recurrence relation**: \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n3. **Find the closed-form solution**: \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n4. **Compute for the outermost layer (n=9)**: \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29,524 \\).\n5. **Multiply by 3**: \\( 3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572 \\).\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nThe next digit is 2 (from 29524, which is 2*10,000), so 2*3=6, write 6.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct: 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, let me check with another method to be sure. 29524*3: 29,524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12.\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000+1,500=88,500; 88,500+60=88,560; 88,560+12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate a step. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of the operation 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis looks like a linear recurrence relation. In general, for such a recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n, which might make computing the value easier, especially if there are many layers.\n\nThe standard solution method for linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence as:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The associated homogeneous equation is:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation for this is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is:\n\na_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, we need a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution. Let's assume a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, there are 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can see that each layer n is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, and thus, for n=9, it's 29524, leading to the final result of 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I might have kept computing each layer step by step, which is what I did initially, and it also led me to the same result. So, both methods are valid, but recognizing the recurrence relation allows for a more efficient computation, especially if the number of layers were much larger.\n\nIn summary, by either iteratively computing each layer or by solving the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, I arrive at the same final answer. So, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that each layer \\(n\\) can be expressed as \\(\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364.

Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems like a big number. Let me check if I did each step correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, seems consistent. But let me try another approach to make sure. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general form is a_n = a_{n-1} + c, but here it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Hmm, actually, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_p = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. Okay, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572. Let me just compute 29524 * 3 to be thorough: 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, that's not the right way. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after verifying each step and using a different method to solve the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4.

Wait, but the original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. But wait, let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ...))) So, each time, we're adding another layer. Since I started from Layer 1 as the innermost, and went up to Layer 9, which is the outermost, that should be correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me explore that approach to verify. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. Wait, that's exactly what I did before. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see if there's a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms to see if I can find a pattern: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I found before. Now, I can also try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since this is a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques. The general form of a linear recurrence is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, which is what we have here, where c = 3 and d = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 - d/(c - 1)) * c^{n-1} + d/(c - 1). Let me plug in the values: Here, a_1 = 4, c = 3, d = 1. So, the formula becomes a_n = (4 - 1/(3 - 1)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(3 - 1) = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2 = (7/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (7/2)*3^{0} + 1/2 = (7/2)*1 + 1/2 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (7/2)*3^{1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I found a_2 = 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in the formula?\n\nWait, let me double-check the formula. The standard solution for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = (a_1 - d/(c - 1)) * c^{n-1} + d/(c - 1). So, in this case, c=3, d=1. So, a_n = (4 - 1/(3 - 1)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(3 - 1) = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3^{n-1} + 1/2. But when n=2, that gives (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = (21/2) + (1/2) = 22/2 = 11, which doesn't match the actual a_2 =13. So, I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different because the recurrence starts at n=1. Let me check again. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is indeed a_n = (a_1 - d/(c - 1)) * c^{n-1} + d/(c - 1). But maybe I misapplied it. Let me try calculating for n=2: a_2 = (4 - 1/(3-1)) * 3^{2-1} + 1/(3 - 1) = (4 - 1/2) * 3 + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. But from the recurrence, a_2 is 13, so something's wrong here. Maybe the formula is not correctly applied because the initial term is a_1, and the formula is intended for n >= 1, but perhaps I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, in our case, a_1 is the first term, which is 4, and a_2 is the second term, which is 13. Let me try using the formula with n=2: a_2 = (7/2)*3^{2-1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. But that's not matching 13. So, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the formula. Alternatively, maybe the formula is a_n = (a_1 - d/(c - 1)) * c^{n} + d/(c - 1). Let me try that.\n\nWait, no, the standard formula is a_n = (a_1 - d/(c - 1)) * c^{n-1} + d/(c - 1). So, maybe I need to adjust the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the first term is a_1, so when n=1, a_1=4, but the formula might be intended for n starting at 0. Let me check that. If n=0, a_0 would be undefined, so perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the formula applies for n >= 2. Let me try plugging in n=2 using the formula:\n\na_2 = (a_1 - d/(c - 1)) * c^{2-1} + d/(c - 1) = (4 - 1/2) * 3 + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11, which still doesn't match the actual a_2=13. So, perhaps the formula is incorrect, or I'm applying it wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's solve the recurrence relation step by step. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = 3*a_{n-1}^{(h)}, whose solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^{4})/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5)/2 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n24 * 3 = 72, carryover 7.\n\n24: 4*3=12, plus 7=19, carryover 1.\n\n5*3=15 +1=16, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me recount the layers and ensure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and the closing parentheses come at the end. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one more than the previous. Since I started with Layer 1 as the innermost, and went up to Layer 9, that's correct because there are nine layers of \"1+3(\".\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the expression as having 9 nested levels. So, computing up to Layer 9 is correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Moving outward, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524: Well, 3 * 29000 = 87000, and 3 * 524 = 1572. So adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then +123=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, the outermost expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's breaking down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, that's the same as before. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me just make sure that I didn't skip any layers or miscalculate any step. Sometimes when you have so many layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate a step. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miss any. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, the number of layers is 9, as I thought earlier. Let me count how many times I computed the layers: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Yes, that's 9 layers. So, each step seems correct. Therefore, the final result after multiplying by 3 is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to compute this without having to compute each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it that way. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2, up to a_9. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. To solve this recurrence relation, perhaps we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is known. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, but actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for a_9. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric progression might have allowed me to compute it more quickly, but since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), computing each step manually wasn't too bad. However, knowing the general formula could be helpful if the number of layers were larger. In any case, both methods lead to the same conclusion. So, after carefully working through each layer and verifying my calculations, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3\\) times another similar expression.

Let's see how this goes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break this down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the outermost operation is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. Hmm, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem. Perhaps there's a formula or a pattern that can help me compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially since this could be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each layer is built from the next one, so maybe it's better to think of it as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me try to see if that's the case. Let's consider the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 13 = 1 + 3*4\nLayer 3: 40 = 1 + 3*13\nLayer 4: 121 = 1 + 3*40\n...\n\nEach term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Specifically, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, L_1 is the innermost layer, which is 4, and each subsequent layer is built outward. So, if we have 9 layers, then the outermost layer is L_9, which we computed as 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 88572. But perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to derive that. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = homogeneous solution + particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3, L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4, L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is L_9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2, that's 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, L_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms our earlier result using a different method, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29,524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, it's 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check each step because sometimes when you do a lot of steps, it's easy to make an error. Let me verify each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and the multiplications and additions seem accurate. Alternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, which is similar to a geometric progression but not exactly the same. Let me see if there's a formula I can apply here. Let's denote the innermost term as a\u2081 = 1 + 3. Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081, a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082, and so on up to a\u2089. Each term is a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4. This is a recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's assume a solution of the form a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3\u207f + B = 1 + 3(A*3\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + B). Let's compute the right side: 1 + 3A*3\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + 3B = 1 + A*3\u207f + 3B. So, setting equal to left side: A*3\u207f + B = 1 + A*3\u207f + 3B. Subtract A*3\u207f from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a\u2081=4. So, 4 = A*3\u00b9 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3\u00b2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3\u00b3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3\u2074 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2. Let me compute 3\u00b9\u2070. 3\u00b9=3, 3\u00b2=9, 3\u00b3=27, 3\u2074=81, 3\u2075=243, 3\u2076=729, 3\u2077=2187, 3\u2078=6561, 3\u2079=19683, 3\u00b9\u2070=59049. So, a\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524=88,572. So, that confirms it. Alternatively, if I had to compute this without recognizing the pattern, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, which also led me to the same result. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but the original expression starts with 3 times Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high, but let me check again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Okay, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, writing down each step as I go. Starting with the innermost parentheses: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Continuing: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))) = 3*(1 + 3*9841) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that matches what I got before. So, I think I did it correctly. Each step builds on the previous one, and by carefully computing each layer, I arrived at the final answer. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

The original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total value would be 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572 (correct). Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence relation is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition. Wait, but in our case, a = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula might be a bit different. Let me recall the formula for the solution of a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*a^n, and the particular solution is L_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence relation: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since the original expression is 3*(L_9) where L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88,572 is the correct result. I think that's thorough enough. I considered both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach, verified the results, and they match. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nLet me just make a table of each layer to ensure I didn't skip any steps or make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer | Calculation | Result\n-----|-------------|-------\n1    | 1 + 3       | 4\n2    | 1 + 3*4     | 13\n3    | 1 + 3*13    | 40\n4    | 1 + 3*40    | 121\n5    | 1 + 3*121   | 364\n6    | 1 + 3*364   | 1093\n7    | 1 + 3*1093  | 3280\n8    | 1 + 3*3280  | 9841\n9    | 1 + 3*9841  | 29524\n\nTotal expression: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I did it correctly. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated until the outermost layer is reached, and then the final result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n4.

Let me do that: 3*29524 = 88572 So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer's value is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Each step is straightforward, but the numbers grow quite rapidly. Let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer individually. The expression is of the form: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3))...)) with nine layers. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is based on the previous one. The general formula for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), assuming k \u2260 1. In this case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, so k=3, c=1. Starting from a_1 = 4, so a_0 would be undefined here, but perhaps starting from a_1. Alternatively, let's adjust the formula to fit our case. Let me think of it as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Then, the general solution can be found by solving the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13, which matches our earlier calculation. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches the earlier result. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. This makes me confident that the answer is correct. I think I've got it!\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from this relation, we determine the value of the outermost layer and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Recurrence relation**: Each layer \\( a_n \\) is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **General formula**: The solution to the recurrence is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Compute the outermost layer**: For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recheck each layer quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >1. Then, the problem is to compute 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p =1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, a_9 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula for a_n to compute a_9 directly, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. However, knowing the general formula is useful in case the number of layers increases.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't miss anything:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure of the expression.\n2. Start computing from the innermost parentheses, layer by layer.\n3. Alternatively, model the expression as a recursive sequence and find a closed-form formula.\n4. Verify the formula with known values.\n5. Apply the formula to find the value of the outermost layer.\n6. Multiply by the coefficient outside the parentheses (which is 3 in this case).\n7. Ensure all calculations are correct by double-checking.\n\nI think I've covered all the necessary steps and verified each part, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the recursive pattern and computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer and ultimately the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from the innermost layer.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by the Outer Coefficient**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 is 88500, +72 is 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.

Let me do Layer 4 next: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364.

The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to find a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me see. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. So, starting from L_1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous one. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using methods for solving linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The recurrence is of the form L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since the original problem has 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations. It's always good to verify with both step-by-step computation and a general formula to ensure consistency.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Let's add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, the result of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9 or the multiplication. So, Layer 9 was 1 + 3*9841. Let me check 3*9841: 9841 * 3. Let's compute that: 9000*3 = 27,000 800*3 = 2,400 40*3 = 120 1*3 = 3 Now, adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 29,520 + 3 = 29,523 So, Layer 9 is 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Then, 3*29,524. Let me compute that again: 29,524 * 3. 20,000*3 = 60,000 9,000*3 = 27,000 500*3 = 1,500 24*3 = 72 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait a second, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, we have Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9. So, each time, we compute the innermost first, then build up. So, if I have Layer 1 as 4, then Layer 2 as 13, Layer 3 as 40, and so on, that seems correct. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or go too far. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1). Then, moving out, each time adding another layer. So, Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 13, Layer 3 is 40, Layer 4 is 121, Layer 5 is 364, Layer 6 is 1093, Layer 7 is 3280, Layer 8 is 9841, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made an arithmetic error. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula here. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer (n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. The general form of such a recurrence is Layer n = a*Layer (n-1) + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is given by Layer n = (Layer 1 - b/(a-1)) * a^{n-1} + b/(a-1). Let me recall the formula for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is Layer n = C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant. So, let's find the particular solution. Let me assume the particular solution is a constant K. Then, K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Hmm, that seems a bit odd, but okay. So, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: Layer 1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my earlier computation. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29,524. As computed before, that's 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's see: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. I think that's solid. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern, we can compute each layer step by step. Using the formula for the linear recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the pattern Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is just adding 1 and then tripling the previous result, which leads to exponential growth in the numbers. So, by the time you get to the ninth layer, it's already in the thousands, and then tripling that gives a pretty large number. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus three times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer's result by three. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that worked. Now, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, interesting. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Okay, that seems correct. Let me recap all the layers to ensure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but each step seems to follow logically. I think I did each multiplication correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution can be found using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^{n} + (b/(a-1))*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, no, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me write down the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n = 1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n = 2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n = 3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula seems to hold. So, for n = 9, which is the outermost layer:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCalculating 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's the same answer as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the expansion would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me try to write it out:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, perhaps the expansion isn't a simple geometric series but a nested multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see.\n\nLooking back at the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Since there are nine layers, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, another way to think about it is that each layer is contributing a term that's a power of 3.\n\nWait, let me try to see if there's a pattern in the numbers I got:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1\n\nLayer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1\n\nLayer 5: 364 = 3*121 + 1\n\nLayer 6: 1093 = 3*364 + 1\n\nLayer 7: 3280 = 3*1093 + 1\n\nLayer 8: 9841 = 3*3280 + 1\n\nLayer 9: 29524 = 3*9841 + 1\n\nSo, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. Which is consistent with the recurrence relation L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is the same thing, just written differently. So, yeah, that's consistent.\n\nSo, using that recurrence, we can compute each layer, as I did, or find a closed-form solution, which we also did.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me try to expand the entire expression step by step without using the formula, just to cross-verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524*3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572.\n\nYep, that's the same result as before. So, I'm pretty confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the expression in terms of a geometric series, each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but I have to be careful because it's not a simple geometric series; it's a nested expression. But using the recurrence relation and the closed-form formula helped me confirm the result without expanding each layer manually, which is a good check.\n\nSo, in summary, by computing each layer step by step and then verifying using a recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer each time. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and ultimately compute the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_n, it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, that's a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, a_3=40. Great, so the formula works. So, for a_9, which is the 9th layer, it's (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer again. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88572. Hmm, same result as before. So, 88,572 is the answer. But wait, let me think again. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, which could be time-consuming and error-prone. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each layer is a_n. But in this case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 is the value we need, then multiply by 3. Alternatively, this recurrence relation can be modeled as a geometric series. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers again using the formula. For example, layer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: n=3, a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula works. Therefore, layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572. Yeah, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel good about this answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.

Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. Let's compute that: 3*29524.

That seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, but let me think again. Each time we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. This looks like a geometric series, doesn't it? Maybe there's a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me recall the formula for a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series is S_n = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. But in this case, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Hmm, actually, that's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can model it with a recurrence formula. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1, a_1=4; n=2, a_2=13; n=3, a_3=40; and so on, up to a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using both methods, computing step by step and using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000; 9000*3=27000; 500*3=1500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each step and verifying with a formula, I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer multiplies this result by 3 and adds 1, leading to a rapid increase. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the ninth layer equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.

Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric sequence or something similar. Let's see: Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it using this approach. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that with n=1: L_1 should be 4. Plugging in n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Formula: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is the outermost one, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 times 29524. Let me compute this step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, carry over 1, write down 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 =15, carry over 1, write down 5.\n- 9*3 =27 +1=28, carry over 2, write down 8.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 90000 - 1428. Let's compute 90000 - 1428: 90000 - 1000 = 89000, 89000 - 428 = 88572. Yes, same result. So, the final value is 88572. Let me recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Start from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n3. Compute each layer step by step up to the 9th layer, which gives 29524.\n4. Multiply the 9th layer by 3 to get the final result: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I can also consider if there's a formula or pattern that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's see if I can find another condition. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me compute a few terms to see the pattern:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the terms are growing exponentially, which makes sense because of the 3^n factor. To find a closed-form, let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute it without having to compute each layer manually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable, though time-consuming. I think I've got the correct answer here. To be thorough, let me verify the multiplication once again: 29524 *3. Let's compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as (29000 + 524)*3 = 29000*3 +524*3=87000 +1572=88572. That confirms it again. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each layer step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Well, 3 times 20,000 is 60,000. 3 times 9,000 is 27,000. 3 times 500 is 1,500. 3 times 24 is 72. Now, adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29,524 equals 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524, correct. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, maybe? Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. That's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio. Let me recall the formula for the sum of a geometric series: S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. But in this case, each term is being added in a nested fashion, so maybe it's a bit different. Alternatively, perhaps it's a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, which is consistent with my previous result. So, both by computing each layer step by step and by finding a general formula using recurrence relations, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by a recurrence relation.

Because the outermost part is 3 times (1 + 3(...)). So, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Hmm, 29,524 times 3. Let me break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, seems consistent. Maybe I can check one of the layers again to be sure. Let's check Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 was 1093, so 3*1093=3279, plus 1 is 3280. Yes, that's correct. Similarly, Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524, correct. So, 3*29524=88,572. I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, computing each one isn't too bad. It seems like each layer is following the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence relation. If I were to generalize, each layer n can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence relation might give a formula for a_n, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572. So, using the closed-form formula also leads to the same result, confirming that the answer is correct. I think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then verified using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. Both methods gave me the same answer, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can evaluate each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. Let me compute the next few layers to see if a pattern emerges. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 20 is 60, and 3 times 4 is 12. Wait, that might be too tedious. Alternatively, I can just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let's do that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. So, putting it all together, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 more carefully. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that seems correct. Let me just verify with another method. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 90000 - 1428. Let me compute that: 90000 - 1000 = 89000, 89000 - 428 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result. So, the final value of the expression is 88572. Let me just recap what I did: I started by recognizing that the expression was a series of nested operations, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. I computed each layer from the innermost to the outermost, which gave me the value at each step, and then finally multiplied the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I didn't make any mistakes as far as I can tell, and the final calculation checks out with two different methods, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems consistent. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524, times 3 is 88572. I think that's solid. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
