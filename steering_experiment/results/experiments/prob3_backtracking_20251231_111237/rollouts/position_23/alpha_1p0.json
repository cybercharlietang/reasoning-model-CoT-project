    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093. Let's break it down: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me verify that multiplication again. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think I did it right, but just to be thorough, let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Looking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote the layers as a sequence a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0, where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, actually, the standard solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). But in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so a_0 would be 1, right? Because a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, so if a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. So, using the formula, a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Since a_0 = 1, this simplifies to a_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: a_n = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, that seems too good to be true. Let me test it with n=1: a_1 should be 4. Plugging into the formula: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 should be 13. Formula: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 should be 40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer sequentially, we find the value of each until we reach the outermost layer.

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that's better. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, interesting. So, Layer 3 is 40. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let's compute a few more layers to see if there's a trend. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572.

Let's add them: 59048 + 29524. 8 + 4 = 12, carryover 1. 4 + 2 = 6 +1=7. 0 +5=5. 9 +9=18, carryover 1. 5 +2=7 +1=8. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a minute, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again just to be thorough. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems to be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), which looks like a geometric series or something similar. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4=13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, and so on, which matches what I calculated earlier. Now, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard form is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the innermost expression, which is Layer 9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let me check that. 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which is much faster and less error-prone than computing each layer step by step. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: Well, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me verify that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think my answer is correct.

Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364, let me compute that: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, but actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So multiplying each by 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me recompute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. 1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000+840=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. 1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. But I wonder if there's a recursive formula or something that could have made this faster. Let me think. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since the numbers get large quickly, maybe it's not necessary here. Alternatively, recognizing that each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's a geometric series in some way. Let me try to model it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer can be expressed as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 4. So, solving the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming L_p(n) = C, a constant. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in my step-by-step computation, and the formula confirmed it. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that seems right. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's a jump, but okay. Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, wait a second. The original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Let's compute that. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3=88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let's go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=40, correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=121, correct. Layer5:1+3*121=364, correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 =4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4=3A + B. Now, let's find another condition. Since the recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients, we can find the particular solution. Alternatively, we can compute L_n using the method for solving linear recursions. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D +1 => D - 3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, Layer 9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression as a geometric series, maybe I can represent it that way. Let me try that approach. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). If I expand the entire expression, it might form a geometric series. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E=3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))=3*(1 + 3*(E')) where E' is a similar expression but with one less layer. Wait, but this might not directly help because each layer is nested. Alternatively, perhaps I can express E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3))...)). Since there are 9 layers, maybe I can express E as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me try to write this as a sum: E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let's expand this step by step. Starting from the innermost: 1 +3=4. Then, moving out: 1 +3*4=13. Then, 1 +3*13=40. Then, 1 +3*40=121. Then, 1 +3*121=364. Then, 1 +3*364=1093. Then, 1 +3*1093=3280. Then, 1 +3*3280=9841. Then, 1 +3*9841=29524. Then, E=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me see: Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, for each layer, it's like 1 + 3*(previous). So, after n layers, it's 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)). If I think of it as a sum, it's like 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + ... +3^{n-1}*1, but that might not capture the nesting correctly. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 +3*(previous), so it's more like a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to see: If I denote S as the sum after n layers, then S_n =1 +3*S_{n-1}. Wait, that's similar to the recursive formula I had earlier. So, S_n =3*S_{n-1} +1, which is the same as L_n. So, yes, it's the same recurrence relation. Therefore, the sum S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as I found earlier. Therefore, after 9 layers, S_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*S_9=88572. So, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways now. Each method leads me to the same answer, 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29,524. Let me calculate that: 29,524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the result of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number. Maybe I made an error in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1,080 + 12 = 1,092. Then, 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9,000 + 600 = 9,600 + 240 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, the final step: 3 * 29,524. Let me compute that again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. So, unless I made a mistake in one of the layers, which I've checked, the result should be 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which would save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition to find B. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let me also compute a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substituting A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since the expression has nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 - 1 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29,524 = 88,572, as I calculated before. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049, 3^11=177,147. So, 3^{11}=177,147. Therefore, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a closed-form formula. The final result is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Compute each layer up to the ninth layer, resulting in 29,524.\n2. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Now, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Next, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Moving on to Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Wait a second, but the original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. Let me compute 3*29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me go through each layer again briefly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, which would save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. Let's see, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1. Therefore, B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, plug in n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3A => A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values to make sure. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049, so 3^{10} -1 = 59048. Then, 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to recognize this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. But in this case, since each term is built upon the previous one with a multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, it's more like a linear recurrence, as I thought earlier. So, I think the approach I took is correct, both by computing each layer step by step and by finding the closed-form formula using the recurrence relation. Either way, I end up with the same final value. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me confirm that. So, Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up to the outermost one. Let me write down each layer's value as I compute them. Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.

Let me check my calculations again because that number seems high, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, plus 3*1=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, no, that's not the right breakdown.

Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm, but let me check with another method to be sure. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, that seems like a big number. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to see if I have the right number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Starting from the first 3, each subsequent ( is a new layer. Let me count them: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, that's 9 layers. Therefore, I computed up to Layer 9 correctly. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions to avoid computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. Since each layer corresponds to n=1 to n=9, the outermost layer is n=9, so Layer9 = (3^{10}-1)/2. Correct. Therefore, the final result is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer and then verifying with a formula helped me ensure that I didn't make any mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Then Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just quickly verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. I think I did that correctly. Each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is a linear recurrence. It might have been possible to find a formula for the nth term, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. I guess another way to think about it is that each layer is following the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, each term is three times the previous term plus one. That's a linear recurrence relation, and if I remember correctly, it can be solved using the formula for such sequences. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Let me try applying that here. Here, k is 3 and c is 1. So, the formula would be a_n = (a_1 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1). Simplifying that, it's (a_1 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Given that a_1 = 4, plugging that in: (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me compute a_n using this formula for n=9. So, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. 3^8 is 6561. So, (9/2)*6561 = (9*6561)/2. Let me compute 9*6561: 6561*10 = 65610, minus 6561 gives 65610 - 6561 = 59049. So, 59049/2 = 29524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good check. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the linear recurrence, I end up with the same result. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, okay, let's keep going. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093: 1093*3 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 9841*3. Hmm, 9841*3. Let me do that step by step. 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Because the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by the result of Layer 9. So, the total value is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

So, the final computation is: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: First, 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 20 = 60, and 3 * 4 = 12. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Alternatively, I can compute it directly: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nFirst, multiply 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2 and carry over 1.\nNext, 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\nNext, 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5 and carry over 1.\nNext, 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28. Write down 8 and carry over 2.\nNext, 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Write down 8.\nFinally, there are no more digits, so we're done.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this multiplication another way to be sure. Alternatively, I can break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't skip any layers. I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, which was 1 + 3 = 4, then Layer 2 as 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to Layer 9 as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I can compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572. I think that's the right answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the problem isn't too long, step-by-step computation seems manageable. If there were more layers, perhaps recognizing a geometric series or some recursive pattern could be useful, but here, with nine layers, step-by-step is feasible.\n\nWait, actually, let me think about whether there's a formula for such expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, maybe we can derive it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the approach was:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result.\n3. After computing the innermost layer up to the outermost, multiply the result by 3.\n4. Alternatively, derive a formula using the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, which confirmed the result.\n\nI think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that's manageable. Let's go to Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's growing quickly. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let's calculate that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (20 * 3) + (4 * 3)\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because each layer was growing exponentially, so it's possible, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLet me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 another way. Let's compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nHmm, but I just realized that the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire expression inside. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me count how many layers there are to make sure I didn't miss any. The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a layer, and each subsequent layer wraps around that.\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, because each opening parenthesis is closed, so each layer adds one more.\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers of 1+3(...) are there? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then each step adds another 1 + 3*(...)\n- So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1+3)\n- Then Layer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1))\n- Layer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n- And so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost is 3*(...), so the innermost is (1+3), and each step adds another layer, so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each (1+3( is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach time I see a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each (1+3( is a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of \"1+3\" expressions. Alternatively, let's see how many times we have a \"1+3(...)\".\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me see: The problem is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of closing parentheses. Each layer adds another closing parenthesis. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so each time we have a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1+3(\", each one is a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \u2192 first layer\n2. Inside that, another 1+3(...) \u2192 second layer\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", each \"(\" after that is a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought, because I can see that the innermost is (1+3), and each step out adds another layer, so up to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. But let me confirm the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I can approach this problem using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and this is a geometric series, maybe I can find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me think about it. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers (from n=1 to n=9), the outermost layer is L_9.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9. Because when I look at the problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time I see a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression.\n\nStarting from the first \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the first \"1 + 3(\" is after the initial 3, then each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"(\" after the initial 3 signifies a new layer.\n\nLet me parse it:\n\n- 3( starts the expression.\n- Then inside, the first \"1+3(\" is the first layer.\n- Then each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the first \"1+3(\", each occurrence is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3( \u2192 layer 1\n2. Then inside, another 1+3( \u2192 layer 2\n3. Another \u2192 layer 3\n4. Another \u2192 layer 4\n5. Another \u2192 layer 5\n6. Another \u2192 layer 6\n7. Another \u2192 layer 7\n8. Another \u2192 layer 8\n9. Another \u2192 layer 9\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, after the initial 3(, the first \"1+3(\" is layer 1, and then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer, so up to 9 layers in total, which would mean L_9 is the outermost layer, as I computed earlier.\n\nWait, but when I counted the layers earlier, I thought there were 9 layers, but when I look at the expression, perhaps it's 9 layers starting from the innermost. Let me check:\n\nThe innermost part is (1+3), which is layer 1.\n\nThen each step out adds another layer, so the next one is (1+3*(layer 1)), which is layer 2.\n\nContinuing this way, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is L_9 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" after the initial 3 is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3( \u2192 layer 1\n2. 1+3( \u2192 layer 2\n3. 1+3( \u2192 layer 3\n4. 1+3( \u2192 layer 4\n5. 1+3( \u2192 layer 5\n6. 1+3( \u2192 layer 6\n7. 1+3( \u2192 layer 7\n8. 1+3( \u2192 layer 8\n9. 1+3(1+3) \u2192 layer 9\n\nWait, actually, when I count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3, I can see that there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\", which would mean 9 layers. So, that's correct. Thus, L_9 is indeed the outermost layer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the number of layers as the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, which is 9 times, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, using the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this problem. Maybe using a loop or iterative method, but since I'm doing this manually, I think the step-by-step approach and the formula both give me the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- The problem is a nested expression with 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...).\n- Each layer can be computed step by step, starting from the innermost.\n- Alternatively, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation gives the same result.\n- The final computation is 3 times the outermost layer, which is 29524, resulting in 88572.\n\nI don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal computation: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that's manageable. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, so Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Wait, no. Let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost layer is 3 times Layer 9. So, the total value would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the total value is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because this seems like a big number, and I don't want to make a mistake. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again. 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions, but given that there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable. But just to explore, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such expressions. Suppose I have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I computed. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I don't need to go that deep since I already have the value. However, for future reference, the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1=4, and the outermost layer is layer 9, which would be a_9. Using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I were to compute it using the formula, since a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147.

Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right.

Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Let me keep going to see if it becomes clearer. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems right. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Right. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Yes. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Right. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, I think I did that correctly. Each layer was computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially, I guess. So, the final result is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, I could represent this as a recursive function. Let me define f(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, f(1)=4, f(2)=1+3*4=13, f(3)=1+3*13=40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. So, using this recursive formula, I can compute each layer step by step, which I did. Therefore, f(9)=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*f(9)=88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for f(n). Let me think. The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a constant particular solution. Let me find C first. The recurrence is f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 1. Let's assume a constant particular solution, C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, but that seems odd because our initial conditions are positive integers. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the method for solving linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say f_p(n) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: f(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, f(9) = (3^10)/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result using a different method. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented recursively. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the outermost layer's value to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time we're doing 1 + 3*something. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, the general formula would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a term in a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added, it's a bit more involved. But the recurrence relation approach worked well. So, to summarize, by computing each layer step by step or by solving the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result: 88,572. I feel confident that this is the correct answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using a recurrence relation, we find the result to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that seems right. So, Layer 2 is 13. Then Layer 3 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Got it. So, Layer 3 is 40. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which we just found to be 29524. So, the final computation is: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I wrote 1092 as 1,092, which is correct, but then when I did Layer 6, I wrote 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. But in my next step, Layer 7, I wrote 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Wait, 3*1093 is indeed 3279, so that's correct. Then Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, but when I did Layer 6, I wrote 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, but in the step-by-step above, I labeled it as 1,093, which is the same as 1093. So, that's correct. Wait, but when I broke down 29,524 * 3, I did it as 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4, which is correct. 20,000 * 3 is 60,000; 9,000 *3 is 27,000; 500*3 is 1,500; 20*3 is 60; 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. That seems correct. So, my final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or count incorrectly. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent 1+3(...) is another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3(...) adds another layer. Let me see: The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. Let me count the number of layers: 1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(...)\n3. Then: 1+3(...)\n...\nUp to the outermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3\n2. 3(1+3\n3. 3(1+3\n4. 3(1+3\n5. 3(1+3\n6. 3(1+3\n7. 3(1+3\n8. 3(1+3\n9. 3(1+3\n\nWait, but the innermost is 1+3, so that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, the total number of layers is 9. So, I computed up to Layer 9, which is correct. So, that seems right. Therefore, my final answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the multiplications and additions are accurate. So, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Let me check if that's consistent. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each layer is indeed 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1 as 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, let me list them again step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, so Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*29,524. Let me compute that: 3*29,524. Hmm, 29,524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, 29,524 is a 5-digit number: 2, 9, 5, 2, 4.\n\nWait, actually, 29,524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 ones. So, let's compute each digit multiplied by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because 29,524 * 3: 20,000 *3 = 60,000; 9,000 *3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding these up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Because if Layer 9 is 29,524, then 3 times that is 88,572. But let me check each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's go through each layer step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems to be correct. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(...), where ... is the nested expression. So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. So, if the inner expression evaluates to 29,524, then 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29,524 again. 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down as:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20,000\u00d73 + 9,000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n= 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29,524. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177,147. So, 177,147 - 3 = 177,144. Divided by 2 is 88,572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula, I end up with the same result: 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me quickly recap:\n\n- Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n- Starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n- Multiply the last layer by 3: 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n- Alternatively, using the formula, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nEverything checks out. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe outermost expression is \\(3 \\times 29524\\).

Let me compute 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3. So, 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Now, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Next, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Breaking it down: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Now, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let's do that. 3*29524: Let's break it down into parts. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4. Calculating each term: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and the numbers seem to be increasing exponentially, which makes sense because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. I think I did this correctly. So, yeah, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " The next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so Layer 3 is 40. Let me write this down as I go along to keep track.

Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4*3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1.\nNext, 2*3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\nNext, 5*3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1.\nNext, 9*3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2.\nNext, 2*3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8.\nSo putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, the final result is 88572. Let me just verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364 *3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Let me just see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then each L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L0 + b*(a^n -1)/(a-1), where L0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} =1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n -3L_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P -3P=1 => -2P=1 => P= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, but in our case, the first layer is L1=4. Let's see. Wait, actually, let me check: When n=1, L1=4. So plugging n=1 into the general solution: L1= C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C -1/2 =4. Therefore, 3C = 4 +1/2=9/2. So C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify this with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L1= (3^{2}-1)/2= (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L2= (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the general formula gives the same result as computing each layer step by step. That's reassuring. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, expanding the expression might give a sum of terms like 3^k, but let's see.\n\nWait, starting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 +1\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1 +3*(3+1)=1 +9 +3=13= 3^2 + 3^1 +3^0\n\nWait, 3^2=9, 3^1=3, 3^0=1, so 9+3+1=13. Hmm, interesting.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Now, 40= 3^3 + 3^2 +3^1 +3^0=27 +9 +3 +1=40.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 4: 1 +3*40=121. 3^4=81, 3^3=27, 3^2=9, 3^1=3, 3^0=1. 81+27+9+3+1=121. So, Layer 4 is 3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +3^0.\n\nWait a second, so each Layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k? Let me check.\n\nWait, Layer 1: n=1, sum from k=0 to1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2, sum from k=0 to2:1 +3 +9=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: n=3, sum from k=0 to3:1 +3 +9 +27=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: n=4, sum from k=0 to4:1 +3 +9 +27 +81=121. Correct.\n\nSo, in general, Layer n= sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nBut wait, the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is a geometric series, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Which matches the formula we derived earlier. So, Layer n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9= (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, as before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(sum from k=0 to9 of 3^k). Wait, no, because each layer is itself a sum up to that point. Let me see.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...)))), which is 3*(Layer 9). And Layer 9= sum from k=0 to9 of 3^k= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series and then multiplying by 3. That seems efficient.\n\nSo, the key insight here is recognizing that each nested expression is a partial sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n. Therefore, the entire expression can be expressed as 3 times the sum of 3^0 up to 3^9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nI think I've covered multiple ways to approach this problem, both by expanding each layer step by step and by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. It's also a good reminder of how useful recognizing patterns and using formulas can be in simplifying complex-looking problems.\n\nAnother thing I might consider is checking my work with a smaller version of the problem to ensure my approach is correct. For example, if I had just one set of parentheses: 3(1 +3). That would be 3*(4)=12. Using my step-by-step method: Layer 1=4, then 3*4=12. Correct. Using the formula: Layer 1=(3^2 -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=4, then 3*4=12. Correct.\n\nIf I had two layers: 3(1 +3(1 +3)). Let's compute it step by step: Innermost Layer1=1+3=4, then Layer2=1 +3*4=13, then 3*13=39. Using the formula: Layer2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=13, then 3*13=39. Correct.\n\nSo, this further confirms that my method and the formula are working as intended.\n\nIn conclusion, by carefully working through each layer, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, and verifying with a formula, I've arrived at the solution of 88572. It's a bit tedious to compute each layer manually, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. Using the geometric series formula is a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were much larger.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we recognize a pattern where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). This can be computed step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Compute each layer from the inside out:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the final result is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, 88572. Alternatively, I can verify using another method. Let's break down 29524 into 29000 + 524. Then, 29000 * 3 = 87000. 524 * 3 = 1572. Now, add 87000 + 1572: 87000 + 1000 = 88000, 88000 + 572 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything.

So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the right answer. To make sure, let me try a different approach, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, I also get 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. I think I've covered all the steps, checked my work, and even used a different method to confirm the result. It seems solid.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer.

Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, we have 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, 3*4 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, because that's a lot of steps and it's easy to slip up somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that seems right. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication and addition, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer step by step, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, I see a pattern here where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if I can compute each layer one by one.

Hmm, that seems like a big number, but let me check if I did each layer correctly. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's breaking it down incorrectly. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 2*3=6 (but since it's 20000, it's 60000)\nThen 9*3=27 (but it's 9000, so 27000)\nThen 5*3=15 (500, so 1500)\nThen 2*3=6 (20, so 60)\nThen 4*3=12 (4, so 12)\nNow, adding all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\nSo, yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in my calculations. Each step seems correct. I computed each layer from the inside out, ensuring that each multiplication and addition was accurate. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.

Let me compute that: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*524 = 1572. Wait, actually, maybe it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let me do that: 29524 * 3. 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

Let me write it out step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Wait, but 29524 has digits: 2,9,5,2,4. Wait, perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me count the digits in 29524: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15.

Let me check using another method to be sure. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000.\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500.\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60.\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscalculate a layer, which would throw off all subsequent layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279. So, 3000 + 279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 + 120=29520 + 3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers check out. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to be absolutely thorough, let me try computing the expression in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the 9th layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked each step, verified the layers, and even used a formula approach to confirm the result.

Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check each step because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. Let me go through each layer again more carefully. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (That's correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Yes, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Alternatively, let's compute it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, wait, no, the next digit is 9, which is the ten-thousands place. Wait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 2*3=6, but we have to add the carryover from the previous digit. Wait, let me do it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7, write 7.\n\n5 *3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, but when I compute 29524 *3, I think it should be 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 *3: 29524 +29524 +29524.\n\nCompute 29524 +29524: 29524*2=59048.\n\nThen, 59048 +29524: Let's add 59048 +20000=79048, +9524=79048 +9524=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " The next layer is 1 + 3(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger quickly. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1093*3 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841*3. Let me break that down: 9000*3 = 27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, 3*9841 = 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives Layer 9: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, that's 3*29,524. Let me compute that: 29,524*3. Breaking it down: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct).

Then, 3*29,524: Let me verify that again. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048; 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did that right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that for a second. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so it's similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it that way. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation would be r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. But since the non-homogeneous term is a constant, we can find a particular solution. Let's assume the particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, the original expression has 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9, and the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9 first: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 =88,572, which matches my earlier step-by-step computation. So, using the formula is much faster and avoids the repetitive calculations.

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 = 360, and 1*3 = 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the whole nested expression. So, we have 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I do arithmetic step by step, I might miscalculate a layer. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make this easier without computing each layer. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Let me see if this forms a geometric series or something else. Let's write out the values again: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Hmm, looking at these numbers, each term seems to be 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me check: 4*3 + 1 = 13. Yes. 13*3 + 1 = 40. Yes. 40*3 + 1 = 121. Yes. 121*3 + 1 = 364. Yes. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n to avoid computing each layer step by step. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the closed-form solution is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. Wait, in this case, our recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. So, actually, L_1 is 4, L_2 is 13, etc. So, to fit the standard form, let me adjust the indices. Let me think of L_1 as the first term, so the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 for n \u2265 2, with L_1 = 4. So, in this case, a = 3, b = 1, and L_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = (L_1 - b/(a - 1)) * a^{n - 1} + b/(a - 1). Let me verify that. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n + 1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n + 1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the known values. For n = 1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n + 1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, the entire expression is 3*((3^{10} - 1)/2) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a recurrence relation.

Let me check that again: 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841.

Let me compute that. 3 times 29524: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again to be sure. 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, yes, it's 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer was computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. I computed each layer step by step, from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiplied the result by 3 at the end. Each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which seems consistent. Let me check a couple of the layers again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Since Layer 2 is 13, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 1 + 39 = 40 So Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4 is 1 + 3(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 364*3. Let me do that: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9 is 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524.

Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering how each layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1, it's growing exponentially. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Wait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing any layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, when I numbered them from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost, that should be correct. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, I think my approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've got it right. Just to recap, by either computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result. It's a good feeling when both methods align. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check the multiplication: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(E_9), which is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each E_n is 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E_1=4. So, each step is correct, and the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer, to see if I get the same result. Let me see. Each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, with E_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution satisfies E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution E_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is E_n = E_n^h + E_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition E_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: E_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have E_9, let's compute E_9 using the formula: E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so E_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could compute 3^{10} directly, but I think I've already confirmed it's 59049. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524, times 3 is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from this recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the outermost layer is 3 times this value. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. That seems correct. Wait a second, let me check my layers again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Wait, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, all the layers check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, in case I made a mistake in the manual computation. Let me see. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which is a recursive structure. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent layer is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let me substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, C*3^n + D = 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) + 1 = 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D + 1 = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D + 1. Then, -2D = 1, so D = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 + D = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, each layer a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's thorough enough. I considered both the step-by-step computation and the general formula for the recurrence relation, and both methods gave the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using the recurrence relation formula, we determine that the nth layer is given by \\((3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\). For the 9th layer, this results in 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.
