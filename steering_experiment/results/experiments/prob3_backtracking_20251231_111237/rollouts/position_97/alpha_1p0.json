    "text": " Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe another approach. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, which is equivalent to 3*a_9, where a_9 is the 9th term of the recurrence. So, using the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572. I think that's solid.

The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

So, yes, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. I think that's solid.

Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B +1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B +1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

To find C and D, we can use the recurrence relation and initial condition. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Therefore, equating both sides: C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D + 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Now, in general, for such a recurrence relation, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the solution can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.

Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).

The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found as a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Wait, let me check that.

Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with our step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result we got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.

So, the outermost expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can solve the recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Correct. a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our case, we have a9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2.

Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and the formula, I arrive at the same result.

When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B => B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = 3A + (-1/2) => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's the correct answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the final expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*(a_0 - d/(c-1)) + d/(c-1). Wait, but let me check that. Alternatively, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n = k*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = k*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = k*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3k - 1/2 => 3k = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => k = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, but when n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.

So that's consistent with what I did earlier. Now, the expression is 3*a9. So 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).

    "text": " Let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both methods, step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.

    "text": " Wait, because the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, so that's a_1. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, which is 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. Let me see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. To solve this, we can write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.

Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"
