The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches.

    "text": " Then, the solution to such a recurrence relation can be found. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me recall. For a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c = 3 and d = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, our initial term is a_1 = 4. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Let me define a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4, which would make n=0 correspond to the innermost term. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches Layer 2. So, if we define a_0 = 4, then a_1 = 13, a_2 = 40, etc., up to a_8 = 29524, since there are 9 layers. So, n goes from 0 to 8. Then, using the formula, a_n = 3^{n+1} + (3^{n+1} - 3)/2. Wait, let me see. Let me derive the formula properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 4. Let's find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_0 = 4: 4 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 4 = C - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, the solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+2} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=0: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=1: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, correct. For n=2: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+2} -1)/2. So, for the innermost layer, which is a_0 = 4, and the outermost layer is a_8. So, a_8 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_8 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've covered all the steps, computed each layer, verified with a formula, and even double-checked the multiplication. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nBy working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1.

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p.

Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, it's equivalent to 3*a_9, which is 88572. So, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer (a_9) is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, let's check. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is indeed a_n = A*k^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Alternatively, we can solve it by iteration. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. Starting with a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Alternatively, using the formula for linear recurrence relations. Let me see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the innermost part, a_9, is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is larger.

Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations.

Alternatively, since this is a linear recurrence relation, we can solve it using the formula for such sequences. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * (a_0 - d/(c-1)) + d/(c-1). Wait, let me recall the exact formula. For a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n} * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c=3, d=1. So the general solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * (a_0) + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, but our initial condition is a_1 = 4. So let's adjust the indices. Let me define n starting at 1, so a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. So the general solution is a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. But wait, our initial condition is a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 3^{1}*a_0 + (3^{1} - 1)/2 = 3*a_0 + (3 -1)/2 = 3*a_0 + 1. But we know a_1 = 4, so 3*a_0 + 1 = 4 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. So then, the general formula is a_n = 3^{n} * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let's combine the terms: 3^{n} is equal to (2*3^{n})/2, so adding (3^{n} -1)/2 gives (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1, a_1 should be (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048 /2 =29524. That matches our earlier computation. So, a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula for the total expression, which is 3*a_9, and since a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.

Specifically, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found. Let me try to find the particular solution. Assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. Hmm, but that's a fractional value, and our initial terms are integers. Maybe this approach isn't the best. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so we can write a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}, and so on, until we reach a_1. So, in general, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.

Let me write the recurrence relation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.

Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So that confirms the answer. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's similar to a base-3 number or something, but I think the recurrence approach is clearer here. So, to recap: The innermost expression is 1 + 3 =4. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524. Multiply that by 3 gives the final answer, 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Then, solving this recurrence might give a general formula, which could be faster than computing each layer. The recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before.

So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer 9, which is a_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2: 59048 /2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. It's interesting how the recurrence relation approach gives the same result but in a more formulaic way, which could be useful for larger expressions. But for this problem, since there are only nine layers, computing each step was feasible. I wonder if there's a way to recognize this as a geometric series. Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric progression but with an additional constant term. The closed-form we derived shows that it's indeed a geometric progression scaled by the factor 3, adjusted by the constant term. So, in summary, by either expanding each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, we arrive at the same result.

The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

    "text": " Then, we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. To find A and B, we can use the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B = -1/2. Then, from 4 = 3A + (-1/2) => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our previous result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since each a_n is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n = (3^{n+2}-3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two methods confirm the same result.

    "text": " Then, the solution to this recurrence is a linear recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * (a_0) + c*(k^n - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, let me recall the formula for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is based on the characteristic equation, and the particular solution is a constant if the nonhomogeneous term is constant. So, for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution a_n^p can be found by assuming a constant solution A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as computed earlier. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, where n=1 to 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.

The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.
