Yes, that's correct. So 29524 *3 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1 +12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3:29524 *3=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be more straightforward. But just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me consider that each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 =4. So, L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K =1 +3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Now apply the initial condition: L_1=4= C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) using the formula. Since L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, and the outermost expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. By breaking down each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for such a recurrence, we determine the value of the outermost expression, which results in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check the original problem again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the way I computed it is correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming and prone to error.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps allowing us to compute the nth term without computing each step. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(...)\n\nThen each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one before the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, there are 8 more layers? Wait, maybe I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside:\n\nStarting from the first 1+3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent 1+3(...) adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each time we have another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Each opening parenthesis is a new layer.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach time, it's another layer. Let's see, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Each 1+3(...) is a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first 1+3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3: Layer 1\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n1+3(1+3): Layer 2\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3(1+3)): Layer 3\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there before the final 3 multiplies it?\n\nWait, the expression is 3 times (Layer 9), because each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3(, there's a 1+3(...), which is Layer 1.\n\nThen inside that, another 1+3(...), which is Layer 2.\n\nThis continues until Layer 9, which is the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1+3, and each layer wraps around that, so the number of layers is 9. So, n=9.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to Layer 9, I got a value of 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gave 88572.\n\nBut using the formula I derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my earlier computation of Layer 9 being 29524. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each time we go out, we add another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, then each time we have another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...):\n\nThe expression inside the first 3(...) is:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 1+, there's a 3 followed by (1+3(...)). Each time, it's another layer. Let's count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, meaning n=9.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I can't see any mistakes in the computations, and the formula approach confirms the step-by-step calculation. So I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    - Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n      - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence where each term is defined in terms of the previous one. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n, and then the entire expression is 3*a_n. Wait, in our problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3, so n=9. Let me check if this aligns with what I did earlier. a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc., which matches my earlier computation. So, maybe there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's the same as what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let's think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3*a1, a3=1+3*a2, etc., up to a9. Then, the final result is 3*a9. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. Let's try to find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K =1 +3*K. Solving for K: K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a1= (3^{2})/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a9=(3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=59049/2 -1/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since a9=29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, 3^10=59049. Then, 59049/2=29524.5. Subtracting 0.5 gives 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), which is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then the expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found, but since it's a simple recurrence, maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} Let me write down the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as I can see, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. To solve this recurrence relation, let's find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I did it both by step-by-step computation and by finding a closed-form formula, and both methods gave me the same result.

The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since there are nine layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer.

Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, just to verify. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. Then, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. So, it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume Ln^p = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L9=(3^10 -1)/2. Since n=9, 3^(9+1)=3^10=59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572. Just to make sure, I'll do a quick check with smaller layers to see if the formula holds. For example, Layer 4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Which is what I calculated before. So, yes, the formula works, and my step-by-step computation was correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check my layers again because I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...)) is a layer. Let's count the number of layers: 1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3) sections: The innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...). So each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is layer 1: (1+3) Then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer2) ... Up to layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer8) Then the outermost is 3*(layer9). So, that's 9 layers inside, and then the outermost 3 times that. So, I think I did 9 layers correctly, each time computing layer n = 1 + 3*(layer n-1). So, starting from layer1=4, layer2=13, layer3=40, layer4=121, layer5=364, layer6=1093, layer7=3280, layer8=9841, layer9=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but let me check layer9 again because 3*layer8=3*9841=29523, then 1+29523=29524. That's correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but just to be sure, maybe I can compute a few layers again to see if I made any arithmetic errors. Let's compute layer1 to layer3 again: layer1=1+3=4. Correct. layer2=1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. layer3=1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. layer4=1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. layer5=1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. layer6=1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. layer7=1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. layer8=1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. layer9=1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer9, which is a_9, we have a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer, leading up to Layer 9, which is 29524. The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, resulting in 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, the sequence is a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. So, a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.

This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3: Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each (1+3) is one layer, so each additional layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer. So yes, 9 layers. So when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, that's correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final answer. So, the final result is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. Now, multiplying Layer9 by 3:\n\n29524 * 3. Let me compute this again to be sure.\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

    "text": " Wait, so that gives 88572. Hmm, but let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: Let's compute 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). So, all layers are correct up to Layer 9, which is 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think about whether there's a formula for such expressions. This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. But in this case, it's nested multiple times. Wait, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might be faster. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's substitute a_{n} = A*3^n + B into the equation: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, which I did earlier, and arrived at the same result. Either way, it's consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses and then moving outward.

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. Wait, but actually, L_1 is 1 +3=4. Then L_2=1+3*4=13, L_3=1+3*13=40, etc. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let me find B. Suppose L_n = B for all n. Then substituting into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B => B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me write down the first few terms to see the pattern: L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). It looks like each layer is growing exponentially. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive expression. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution P. Substituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4.

Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the exponentiation part: 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, then 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let's compute 243*243: 243*200=48600, 243*40=9720, 243*3=729. Adding them up: 48600 + 9720 = 58320, plus 729 is 59049. Correct. So, 3^10 is 59049, subtract 1 is 59048, divide by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3 is 88572. Everything checks out. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By iteratively computing each layer, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially.

    "text": " So, yes, 88572. So, the total would be 88572. Wait, but let me check if I did the layers correctly because that seems quite a large number. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps there's a geometric series involved here. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, which is nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, as I double-checked each layer and even derived a general formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so it resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c=1 and r=3. For such a recurrence, the closed-form solution can be found using the formula: a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but actually, since a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, the solution to the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4 is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's compute a few terms using the formula and see if it matches. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but a_1=4, so that's not matching. Maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + something. Let me try to find the correct formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as we saw earlier. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the result I got by computing each layer step by step.

Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might allow me to compute it without going through each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand the entire expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which when expanded would be 3 + 9 + 27 + ... up to nine terms, but I have to be careful because each term is actually multiplied by 3 each time, but with the structure of the expression. Wait, perhaps not exactly a geometric series, but maybe I can model it as such. Let me try to see. If I expand the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me denote the innermost expression as E1: E1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then E2 =1 +3*E1=1 +12=13. E3=1 +3*E2=1+39=40. E4=1 +3*E3=1+120=121. E5=1 +3*E4=1 +363=364. E6=1 +3*E5=1 +1092=1093. E7=1 +3*E6=1 +3279=3280. E8=1 +3*E7=1 +9840=9841. E9=1 +3*E8=1 +29523=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9=88572. So, same as before. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, since E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*E9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using exponents. That's a quicker method, but since I didn't think of it initially, I had to go through each layer. But now I see that recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to find a formula, which makes the computation much faster, especially if there were more layers. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add digit by digit: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 +1=7. 0 +5=5. 9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1. 5 +2=7 +1=8. 2 + nothing=2. So 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. To find C, we can solve the equation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me try to find the closed-form solution. First, the homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have computed it using the formula. Since a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I think I've solved it correctly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation approach, we find a closed-form solution and verify each step. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer, but given that it's only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * (a_0) + d*(c^n - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me check that formula. Yes, for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^n - 1)/(c - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. In this case, c = 3, d = 1. But in our case, the initial term a_1 = 4, so maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let's see. Let me denote the layers as a_1 to a_9, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So to find a_n, we can use the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence. The formula is a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) * d, but I think I need to adjust the indices because a_1 is given. Let me see. Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the recurrence starting from a_0. Suppose I let a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches our initial layer. So in that case, the general formula would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^n - 1)/2. Because d = 1, c = 3, so the formula becomes a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^n - 1)/2. Since a_0 = 1, it becomes a_n = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2. Simplifying that, we get a_n = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that with our earlier computations. For n=1, a_1 should be 4. Plugging into the formula: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 =1 +3*4=13. Formula: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, a_3=1 +3*13=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since our problem has 9 layers, the innermost being layer 1, and the outermost being layer 9, so the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3 times a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since we only have 9 layers, it's manageable either way. So, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with the formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Then, 29524 *3=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a different approach. Let me think. The expression is a geometric series? Wait, because each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I let a_n be the nth term, starting from the innermost, then a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3*a_1=1+12=13, a_3=1+3*a_2=1+39=40, etc., as I did before.\n\nBut maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Suppose I have a nested expression like x = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...)). If it's infinitely nested, then x = 1 + 3x, which would lead to x = 1 + 3x => -2x = 1 => x = -1/2. But in our case, it's finite, so it's not an infinite series. So, the formula for finite nested expressions can be different. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\na1=4\n\na2=13\n\na3=40\n\na4=121\n\na5=364\n\na6=1093\n\na7=3280\n\na8=9841\n\na9=29524\n\nWait, let me see if there's a pattern in the coefficients. Let's see:\n\na1=4= (3^1) +1\n\nWait, 3^1=3, 3+1=4. That works.\n\na2=13=3^2 + 3 +1=9+3+1=13. Yes, that works.\n\na3=40=3^3 +3^2 +3 +1=27+9+3+1=40. Correct.\n\na4=121=3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3 +1=81+27+9+3+1=121. Yep.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, which is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, a1=4= (3^2 -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=4. Correct.\n\na2=13= (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=13.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let me try to find B. If a_n = B, then substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as computed earlier. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, the value is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that also gives the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the recurrence relation, we find that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Wait, no, 3280 is 3000 + 200 + 80. So 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So total is 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 + 120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me try to model it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1. Solving for C: C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n is following a geometric progression, so using the formula for the sum of a geometric series might have been another approach, but in this case, since the recurrence is straightforward, the formula I derived works perfectly. I think this is solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the step-by-step computation as well as the closed-form formula both lead to the same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check with a different approach to be absolutely sure. Another way to approach nested expressions like this is to recognize a pattern or a recursive formula. Let's denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again without using the formula, just to cross-verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2.

    "text": " So the result is 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Let me check if I did all the layers correctly. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost, which was Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4:1 +3*40=121. Layer 5:1 +3*121=364. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might save time instead of computing each layer. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which corresponds to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this, it might look like a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding it step by step. Let's denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me compute the innermost part first: The innermost is 1 + 3 =4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. But since I have a formula for a_n, I can use that. Alternatively, since E = 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then E=3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, E = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've checked it thoroughly, both by computing each layer step by step and by using the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Therefore, the final answer is 29,523.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer was 88572, but that was based on 9 layers. So, perhaps I need to make sure about the number of layers.\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+\" appears in the expression, excluding the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by a \"3(\", except the innermost one. Let me count the number of \"1+\" instances after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each \"1+\" starts a new layer.\n\nSo, the number of \"1+\" after the initial 3 is 8, leading to 8 layers. Therefore, Layer8 is 9841, and 3*9841=29523.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 29,523.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step until the outermost layer is reached. After computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are 8 such layers after the initial 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n   - **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n   - **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n   - **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n   - **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n   - **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n   - **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - Final result = 3 * 9841 = 29523\n\n**Answer**: 29,523\n\n$\\boxed{29523}$"

Let me just check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. So, it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me think about that.\n\nWait, for a recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, the homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost term is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. Then Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, this formula works.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9, which is the 9th term, would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did before, which also led me to the same result. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute the layers quickly:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's count: 1. 1+3 (Layer 1) 2. 1+3*(Layer1) (Layer2) 3. 1+3*(Layer2) (Layer3) 4. 1+3*(Layer3) (Layer4) 5. 1+3*(Layer4) (Layer5) 6. 1+3*(Layer5) (Layer6) 7. 1+3*(Layer6) (Layer7) 8. 1+3*(Layer7) (Layer8) 9. 1+3*(Layer8) (Layer9) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).

Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, but in this case, a_1=4, a_2=13, etc. Let me see if I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value at the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, a_2=1 +3*a_1=1+12=13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40. a_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +120=121. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, for n >=2, with a_1=4. So, this is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*59048/2=3*29524=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is 88572. Therefore, the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. By breaking down each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each step until reaching the final result. Using the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(...), and each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. That seems right, but I want to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the layers. Let me go through the layers again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or pattern here that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Let's see: Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, we have a recursive relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. In this case, k=3 and c=1. The general solution is a_n = A*3^n + d, where d is a constant particular solution. Let's find d. Assume a particular solution is a constant d. Then, substituting into the recurrence: d = 3*d + 1 => d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048 /2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute this without having to go through each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since I had only nine layers, it was manageable step by step as well. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just double-check my multiplication to be absolutely sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 x3. 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alright, so I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Using a recursive formula, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).

Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on. It seems that each layer follows the recurrence relation:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is of the form L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nL_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2) / 3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWe can factor out 1/2:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for L_n, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = (3/2)*59048.\n\nCompute 59048 / 2 = 29524. Then 29524 *3=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I double-checked each layer, found a general formula, verified it, and confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step. Using a general formula for the nth layer, we find that each layer follows the pattern L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives L_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems consistent. Wait, but let me check Layer 7 again. Layer7:1 + 3*Layer6. Layer6 was 1093. So 3*1093=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer9 corresponds to n=9. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.
