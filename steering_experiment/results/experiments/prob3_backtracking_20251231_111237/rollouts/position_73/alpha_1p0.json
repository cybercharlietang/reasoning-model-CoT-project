    "text": " 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if that holds. a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Yep, that's what I did earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n} * (a_0) + c*(k^{n-1} + k^{n-2} + ... + k + 1). Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1. The initial term a_1 = 4. So, the general solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n-1} + 3^{n-2} + ... + 3 + 1). But wait, since a_1 = 4, perhaps a_0 is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4. Then each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9. Wait, but in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, which is the same as before. So, this method also confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Since each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this, it's 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, so it's more like a sum of 3^k terms. Let me think about it. Wait, perhaps if I write the entire expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me consider how many layers there are. From the problem, it's 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds a 3^k term. So, perhaps E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me denote the innermost expression as 1 + 3 = 4, then each layer out adds 1 + 3*previous. As we saw before, each a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, with n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then E=3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can consider E as the sum of a geometric series. Let me see. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. Let me write E as:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me compute the innermost part first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, with n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

But let me cross-verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. a_3 =1 + 3*a_2=1 +39=40. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p =1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1: a_1= A*3^1 -1/2=3A -1/2=4. Solving for A: 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, after n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found. So, for 9 layers, it's (3^{10}-1)/2, which we computed as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we recognize the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost outward.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Specifically, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outer expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To be thorough, let me check the multiplication again: 29524 *3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value to be 29,524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you're multiplying, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the layers. Each step is just 1 + 3*(previous layer), which I computed correctly. So, yeah, I think 88572 is the right answer. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helped.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me see if there's a formula or a pattern that could have saved me time. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, assuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's compute the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, set equal to left side: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 =4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. But in this case, since the number of layers is manageable, computing each step was straightforward. I think I'm confident now that the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything: 1. Recognized the nested structure and decided to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Computed each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. 3. After computing Layer 9, multiplied by 3 to get the final result. 4. Verified the result using a general formula for the recurrence relation, confirming that the result is consistent. 5. Double-checked the arithmetic for each step to ensure no computational errors. All steps seem correct, so I think the answer is solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series. Wait, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me consider the innermost term first. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant. Let me solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), leading to a geometric series. Using the formula for the nth term of this series, we find the innermost value and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\) the next layer.

Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from n1=4, n2=1+3*4=13, n3=1+3*13=40, etc. It looks like each term is following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, n_{k} = 3*n_{k-1} +1. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is n_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants. Let me solve it to see if I can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is n_k = 3n_{k-1} +1, with n1=4. The homogeneous solution is n_h = C*3^k. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution n_p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3D +1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So the general solution is n_k = C*3^k -1/2. Applying the initial condition n1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So n_k = (3/2)*3^k -1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with k=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, which matches n1=4. For k=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, which is n2=13. For k=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer k, n_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the innermost is k=1, and the outermost is k=9. Wait, but in our earlier computation, Layer 9 was n9=29524. Let's see if that matches the formula: n9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define a recursive formula. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, we can compute a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, which matches what I did earlier. Similarly, a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 =4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)}=C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)}=K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n= C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers manually to check. Wait, I already did up to a_9, and each step checked out, so I think it's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but in this case, since it's a linear recurrence, the closed-form solution is more straightforward. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, a_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back through each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me write out the general form for such a recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B = 4. We can find another equation by considering the homogeneous solution. Wait, actually, the recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, using the closed-form expression, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check the original expression again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...), and each layer adds one more 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It's: (1 + 3(...)) repeated how many times? Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So from the innermost, how many layers? Let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each step adds another layer. So from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on, until we have nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Wait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I ended up with 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me check the number of layers again. Let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost is 3*(...), which is the ninth layer.\n\nWait, actually, each time you move a layer out, you add another \"1 + 3(...)\", so from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times you can nest 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first ( after 3( is the start of Layer 1: 1 + 3(...).\n- Then, inside that, another ( starts Layer 2: 1 + 3(...).\n- Continuing, each ( adds a new layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting after the 3, each \"(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...3(1 + 3(...\n3. ...3(1 + 3(...\n4. ...3(1 + 3(...\n5. ...3(1 + 3(...\n6. ...3(1 + 3(...\n7. ...3(1 + 3(...\n8. ...3(1 + 3(...\n9. ...3(1 + 3(...\n10. Then, the last part is (1 + 3))))) So, actually, there are nine layers of 1 + 3(...), meaning that Layer 1 is the innermost 1 + 3, and Layer 9 is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But if there are nine layers, then perhaps my initial computation is correct. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted. Let me try to count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections. Each time you have \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until we have nine layers of 1 + 3(...).\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses before multiplying by 3. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524 = 88572. But to make sure, let me try to compute each layer again, just to confirm that I didn't make an error in any of the steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 88572 seems like a large number, but considering the number of layers, it might be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be solved using a formula, especially if they're repeated multiple times. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nSuppose we have an expression like x = 1 + 3x. Solving for x, we get x = (1)/(3 - 1) = 1/2. But in our case, each layer is x = 1 + 3x, but we have multiple layers. Wait, but each layer is dependent on the next, so maybe we can model it as a geometric series or use recursion.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), we can represent this recursively. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, for n layers, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find the closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.

Wait, but let me check with another method: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12 = 60000 +27000=87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier because when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that was the value inside the parentheses, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Let me just double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 (correct). Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121 (correct). Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364 (correct). Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 (correct).

So the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 terms, computing each step is feasible, as I did earlier. Alternatively, the closed-form formula for a_n can be derived. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let's think about it. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. This looks recursive. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the expression we're trying to compute is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this forms a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form of a linear recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. In this case, c=1, r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^{n} + d, where d is a constant particular solution. Let me find d. Assuming a steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = d. Then d = 1 + 3*d => d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2. Hmm, that's a negative number, which seems odd because all our a_n are positive and increasing. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say d. Plugging into the recurrence: d = 1 + 3*d => d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but with a twist because each term also adds 1. However, I think the approach I took earlier with the recurrence relation is more straightforward. But just to explore, let me see if I can express the entire expression as a sum. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Wait, actually, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, as I did before, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, perhaps the entire expression is 3*a_9. Which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can check using another method. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Let's add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me compute this without expanding each layer. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. Let me consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found using the formula for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the layer number starting from 1. Let's test this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Now, since our expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer step by step, I found that the innermost layer is 4, each subsequent layer grows exponentially, and the final result after multiplying the outermost layer by 3 is 88572. Alternatively, using the recurrence relation approach, I derived a formula that directly gives the value of each layer, which confirmed the step-by-step computation. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

Let me just cross-verify my steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the next layer. So, it's a geometric series perhaps? Let's see. Let me denote each layer as a_i, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each term is a_i = 1 + 3a_{i-1}. This is a recurrence relation. To solve this, maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_i. Let's see. The recurrence is a_i = 1 + 3a_{i-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_i - 3a_{i-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^i. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_i = C*3^i - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with i=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. i=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. i=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_i = (3^{i+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4. Then Layer 2 is a_2=13, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each a_i = 1 + 3a_{i-1}, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. So, expanding the expression, we have: a_9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. If I expand a_9, it's 1 + 3*a_8. a_8 is 1 + 3*a_7, so a_9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_7) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_7. Continuing this way, a_9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9*a_1. But a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. Wait, so maybe a_9 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*(1 + 3). Wait, that seems a bit more complicated. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in this case, for n=8, S = (3^9 -1)/2. But a_9 is 1 + 3*a_8, which, when expanded, gives 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9*1. Wait, that would actually be S = (3^9 -1)/2, but a_9 is S + 3^9*1. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we've already found that a_i = (3^{i+1} -1)/2, and for i=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 59048/2=29524. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Just to ensure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572.\n\nYep, that's correct.

Wait, but let me check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure that I didn't miscalculate any of them. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's assume that the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Let me see if this fits the formula. For n=1: a_1 = 4. Using the formula: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. But a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Maybe my assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the innermost one is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the result. So, yeah, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recurrence relation formula, we find the solution to be:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me check my layers again because I might have miscounted. Let's recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time we add another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent one adds another layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms. The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So from the innermost 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each layer outwards adds another 1+3*(...). So how many layers? Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1). Layer3:1+3*(Layer2). This continues until Layer9:1+3*(Layer8). Then the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So yes, 9 layers inside, then multiplied by 3. So my earlier calculation was correct: Layer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4.\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4. So this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it that way to verify. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_1 through a_9 using this formula to see if it matches our earlier computations.\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\na_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\na_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\na_7 = (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\na_8 = (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same values for each layer. Therefore, the calculation of Layer9 as 29524 is correct. Then, multiplying by 3, as per the original expression, gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express the entire original expression in terms of the recurrence. Let's denote the entire expression as E. So E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to nine layers. From our earlier work, E = 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, E = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo E = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to compute it directly, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. That confirms the result again.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or compute it directly using the formula, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and multiple methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next inner term)}\\).

Wait, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly because that seems like a big number. Let me recompute each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me list each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it differently or check with another method. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For each subsequent layer, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 => A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) directly, but the step-by-step approach seems solid. Let me just check each multiplication step again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 30000 * 3 = 90000, and 476 * 3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step and the arithmetic, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, the innermost layer is found to be 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me think again. Is there a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually? Because computing each layer step by step is time-consuming and prone to error, especially with nine layers. Maybe there's a formula or a geometric series approach. Let's consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this again to be thorough. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form solution. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), leading to the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the given problem with 9 layers, \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me double-check my steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Assume a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^{1} + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the initial terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since our problem has 9 layers, starting from layer1 to layer9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, using both methods, step-by-step computation and finding a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. I think that confirms that the answer is correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute a few more layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Which matches my earlier computation. a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct. a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct. a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct. a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, everything checks out. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572. I think I'm confident with this answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression, which we computed as 29524. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem without computing each layer step by step. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. This seems similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but it's a bit more complex because each term adds 1 before multiplying by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, this recurrence relation is correct.\n\nNow, solving the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4.\n\nWe can find a pattern or solve for A and B. Let's compute a few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 13\na_3 = 40\na_4 = 121\na_5 = 364\na_6 = 1093\na_7 = 3280\na_8 = 9841\na_9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, let's see if they fit the form A*3^n + B.\n\nFor n=1: 3A + B = 4\nFor n=2: 9A + B = 13\nSubtracting the first equation from the second: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nThen, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula would be a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation.\n\nBut since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step by step was manageable, even if a bit time-consuming. It's reassuring that both methods give the same result.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute a few layers quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, all correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is building up a geometric series, but since I already have the step-by-step computation and a formula that confirms it, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by repeatedly substituting from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer, we find that the innermost value grows exponentially, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3. The step-by-step computation confirms that the final answer is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me cross-verify the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. This looks similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression. Suppose I have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, so a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches our earlier computation. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is correct. So in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. Here, c = 1, r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, so maybe I need to adjust the formula. Alternatively, solving the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. Wait, that seems odd, but it's correct. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and we have 9 layers in total. Wait, no, the outermost layer is layer 9, but in terms of n, how does it map? Let me see: Each layer corresponds to n=1 to n=9, but in the formula, a_n corresponds to the nth layer. So in our case, layer 9 would be a_9. So using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation of layer 9 being 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To double-check, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches our earlier computation. Similarly, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern, we can use the formula for the nth term of the sequence, which is \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives us \\(a_9 = 29524\\).

Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...).

Let me count the number of these. From the innermost, which is 1+3, then moving out, each time we have another 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost as layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+\" is followed by a \"3(\".\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+\" sections:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+\" appears.

So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+\"s after the initial 3(...). The expression inside is: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+\" is a new layer.

So, I computed up to Layer 9, which is 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscalculate any layer. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final step is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's define it more formally. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So,\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = (c)/(1 - r) + (a_1)*(r)^{n-1}\n\nWait, but this formula is for a homogeneous recurrence. Let me recall the correct formula.\n\nFor a linear recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is:\n\na_n = r^{n} * (a_0) + c*( (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) )\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, and the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, let me adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nThe general solution for a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} + c/(1 - r)\n\nBut in our case, r = 3, c = 1.\n\nWait, let me check this.\n\nAlternatively, the solution can be written as:\n\na_n = (a_1 + (c)/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} - (c)/(1 - r)\n\nWait, maybe I should derive it step by step.\n\nGiven a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nTo solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is the homogeneous solution plus the particular solution:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this is correct. I can also think about whether there's a way to represent this without computing each layer, using the formula I derived. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using exponents.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified the calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can derive a formula to find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Define a_n as the value of the nth layer. The relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: Using the formula for a linear recurrence, we find a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the 9th Layer**: For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me double-check my computations because sometimes when you have so many layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could try to find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the expression is 3*a_9, since the outermost is 3*(...). So, let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p =1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2= 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's verify this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's the correct approach and the correct answer. It's always good to cross-verify using a different method to ensure that the result is accurate, especially when dealing with multiple layers of nested expressions. So, both the iterative step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula using the recurrence relation lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me check if I did all the layers correctly, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the general formula approach led me to the same result.

    "text": " Next digit:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next:2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because that seems like a lot. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1: 4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I think I did 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of times I did a layer computation. Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then multiply by 3: 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me avoid computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, so each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that approach is incorrect because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4? Wait, no, 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 +4*1. So, 20000 + 9000 =29000, 29000 +500=29500, 29500 +20=29520, 29520 +4=29524. So, 29524 *3: Let's compute 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 +27000=87000, 87000 +1500=88500, 88500 +60=88560, 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Therefore, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a formula, and double-checking the multiplication, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the way it's nested, maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually is feasible. However, for the sake of thoroughness, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3^{10} directly, but that's 59049, as I just used. So, 3^{10} is 59049, so (3^{10} -1)/2 is 29524, times 3 is 88572. So, whether I compute step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.
