Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Wait, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, the term is multiplied by 3 and 1 is added. That's similar to a geometric sequence where each term is a function of the previous term. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me think. If I have a recursive formula like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. First, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = 3*a_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check if this formula works with the layers we computed earlier. For Layer 1 (n=1): a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2 (n=2): a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3 (n=3): a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4 (n=4): a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9 (n=9), a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which can be represented as a geometric series with ratio 3, but since it's nested, it's more of a geometric progression in the exponents. But since I've already solved it using the recursive formula and verified it with the general solution, I think that's solid. Another way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is (3^{n} -1)/2, so the outermost layer is (3^{10}-1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think I'm confident enough now that this is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the formula approach gave the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Wait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or miscalculate. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each layer again quickly to ensure there's no miscalculation. Let me go through each layer step by step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, 3*29524: As before, 29524*3. Let me compute this another way to confirm. 29524*3: Break it down into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, I think I did that correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. Starting with the innermost layer and moving outward, each subsequent layer's value is calculated until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. The step-by-step computation leads to the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check Layer 7 again: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Wait, hold on, that seems off. Wait, 3*9841: Let me compute 9841 * 3 properly.\n\n9841 * 3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So writing it down:\n\n9841\nx   3\n------\n3*1=3\n3*4=12, write down 2, carry 1\n3*8=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry 2\n3*9=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry 2\nBut wait, 9841 is a four-digit number, so after 9, there are no more digits, so the carryover 2 would be added as the next digit. So 9841*3=29523. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. So that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, let me just verify the multiplication again because sometimes when numbers get big, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nAlright, so I think I did each step correctly. Each layer was computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. Then, once I reached the outermost layer, I multiplied by 3 again to get the final answer.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't skip any layers or make an off-by-one error, let me count how many layers there are. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses inside the main 3(...). Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the ninth one.\n\nYes, so I computed nine layers, each time moving outward, so that should be correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer, which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is similar to a geometric series but not exactly because it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which actually forms a geometric progression when expanded.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as a1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nI see a pattern here. Each layer adds another term that's a power of 3. Specifically, a1 = 1 + 3^1.\n\na2 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\na3 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nAnd so on, up to a9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nYes, so each layer an = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9.\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term 1, common ratio 3, and 9 terms.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is S = (r^n - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nSo, S = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWait, but earlier I got a9 as 29524, which was 1 + 3*9841. Wait, no, hold on. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in my earlier step-by-step computation, I had:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 13\n\na3 = 40\n\na4 = 121\n\na5 = 364\n\na6 = 1093\n\na7 = 3280\n\na8 = 9841\n\na9 = 29524\n\nBut according to the geometric series approach, a9 should be the sum up to 3^9, which is 9841. But in my step-by-step, a9 was 29524, which is 3*9841 +1. Hmm, that suggests that the step-by-step approach is different.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the geometric series approach. Let me think again.\n\nEach layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWith a1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, as I computed earlier.\n\nBut if I think of a_n as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then it's a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so for a1, n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\na2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\na3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\na4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\na5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\na6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\na7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\na8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\na9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. So, a9=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, since a9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked using both the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation formula, and both gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me double-check my calculations because this seems a bit high, but considering the number of layers, maybe it's correct. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me see if I can express this as a sum. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each term is multiplied by 3 each time. So, the innermost term is 1, then 3*1 +1, then 3*(3*1 +1) +1, etc. So, each step is like adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds 1 and multiplies the next layer by 3. So, perhaps the entire expression can be thought of as a sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me think. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me see if I can write E in terms of itself, but I think that might not be straightforward because it's a finite number of layers, not an infinite one. For an infinite series, we can write E = 3*(1 + E), but here it's finite, so that approach might not work. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and each next layer is similar, but with one fewer layer. So, maybe the entire expression can be expressed as a sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me try to see. The innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 =13, which is 1 + 3*4. The next is 1 + 3*13=40, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4). So, each layer adds another 1 and multiplies by 3. So, the nth layer is 1 + 3*(n-1 layer). So, for nine layers, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 as we saw earlier. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 3^{10}=59049, correct. Then, 3^{11}=59049*3=177147, correct. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. Correct. So, yes, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me check if I did the layers correctly because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3=4, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous). Let me list each layer again to be sure: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if there's a formula that can represent this. The expression inside is 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let's denote S_n as the sum after n layers. Then, S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 S_3 = 1 + 3*S_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using the method for such equations. The general solution for S_n is S_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Plugging into the recurrence: S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1} Let's substitute S_n = A*3^n + B into the equation: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract B from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2 Now, using the initial condition S_1 = 4: S_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4 So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 Therefore, the general formula is S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: S_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. n=2: S_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: S_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. Great, so the formula works. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, S_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so S_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula confirms the result. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I might have tried to compute each layer step by step, but recognizing it as a geometric series or a linear recurrence helps in finding a more efficient solution. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps. So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3=1 +3*L2, and so on, up to L9. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, starting with L1=4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's see, the recursion is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L1=4= A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. So, 3A + B =4. Now, let's see if we can find another equation to solve for A and B. Wait, but since it's a first-order linear recurrence, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. So, let me assume the particular solution is a constant C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C. Solving for C: C =1 +3C => 0 =1 +2C => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1=4: 4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4=3A -1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 +1/2 =3A => 9/2=3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general formula is Ln= (3/2)*3^n -1/2. Simplifying, that's Ln= (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2. So, for n=9, L9= (3^10)/2 -1/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so L9=59049/2 -1/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from L1=4, L2=1 +3*4=13, L3=1 +3*13=40, and so on. If I write out the terms, it's 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then 88572. Each term is 3 times the previous term minus something? Wait, no, each term is 1 +3*previous term. So, perhaps it's a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but with an added constant each time. That might be more complicated. Alternatively, since we found a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, that's probably the most efficient way. So, in any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result: 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$.\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. \n\n1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've approached this correctly. I started by computing each layer step by step, then recognized the recurrence relation, solved it, and confirmed that the formula gives the same results as the step-by-step computation.

But wait, let me double-check my layers because sometimes when I'm doing these step-by-step computations, it's easy to make an error in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct).

So, that seems consistent. Hmm, but I have a feeling that this might be a known series or something, so maybe there's a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me make sure that the number of layers is correct. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3(...). So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is part of a new layer. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the innermost. Then each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs, which is 9 times. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, as I computed earlier. Therefore, my calculation of 9 layers is correct, leading to L_9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Calculating each layer step by step and applying the formula confirms the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.

Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive expression. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition: a_1 =4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it another way, just to be thorough. Let me try expanding the expression step by step without using the formula. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Compute 1+3=4. Then, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4)=1+12=13. Next layer:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Next:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Next:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Next:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Next:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Next:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Next:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, multiply by 3:3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, I think that's solid. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series, but given that each term is multiplied by 3, it might not directly form a geometric series, but the recurrence relation approach worked well. So, overall, after computing each layer step by step, and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be absolutely sure, let me recompute the final multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let me do it digit by digit: 29524\nx      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 88572.

Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3: 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So I think the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be expressed as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the recurrence relation method also gives the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me try expanding the expression to see if I can spot a pattern. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand it, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, expanding step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nContinuing: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nFinally: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. It seems consistent. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using either step-by-step computation or solving the recurrence relation, we determine that the final value before multiplying by 3 is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when I compute step by step, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it's correct. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But the nesting complicates things. Wait, but since I have a formula for L_n, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of L_9. So, the total expression is 3*L_9, which we've already computed as 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form expression for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let's denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Wait, but actually, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I think of it as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))) with nine layers, then E can be expressed recursively as E = 3*(1 + 3*(E')), where E' is the expression with one fewer layer. But in our case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, so maybe it's better to stick with the earlier approach of computing each layer step by step, which we've already done. Alternatively, perhaps I can express E as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ), since L_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, and E = 3*L_9. So, E = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} to see what that is. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, E = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which again matches our earlier result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different approaches both lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the recursive pattern and using a step-by-step approach, each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses. The expression simplifies to a geometric series, allowing for a closed-form solution. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, right? Let me count them again: Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, starting with the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without doing each layer manually. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd the final result is 3*L9.\n\nThis looks similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Specifically, it's a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our case, we have L9, since we have nine layers. So, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation of Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method also leads us to the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Each layer adds another power of 3. Let me try to see if that's possible. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and the previous is itself a sum involving powers of 3, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, but scaled appropriately. Wait, let me think again. Let's consider the expression inside out. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I denote S_n as the sum after n layers, then S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}.\n\nWait, that's similar to the recurrence we had earlier. So, using the same approach, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, after 9 layers, S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try expanding it.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 3*3 + 3*1 = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13\n\nWait, that's 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\nWait, but 13 can be written as 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nWait, that's 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWhich is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. That's 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 40.\n\nWait, so each layer seems to be the sum of 3^0 to 3^{n} where n increases by 1 each layer.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 3^0 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nYes, so each layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. So, Layer m is sum_{k=0}^{m} 3^k.\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer 1 is sum_{k=0}^1 3^k = 4\n\nLayer 2 is sum_{k=0}^2 3^k = 13\n\nLayer 3 is sum_{k=0}^3 3^k = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be sum_{k=0}^9 3^k.\n\nWait, but let's check: Layer 9 is 29524. Let's compute sum_{k=0}^9 3^k.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Yes, exactly. So, Layer 9 is sum_{k=0}^9 3^k = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(sum_{k=0}^9 3^k) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as 3*(sum_{k=0}^9 3^k) = sum_{k=0}^9 3^{k+1} = sum_{k=1}^{10} 3^k.\n\nWhich would be sum_{k=1}^{10} 3^k = (3^{11} - 3)/ (3 - 1) = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it, using the sum of a geometric series. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation, or recognizing it as a geometric series, I arrive at the same final result: 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the multiple methods all point to the same result. So, I think I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By calculating each layer step by step or recognizing the geometric series pattern, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

But wait, let me check my layers again because I might have miscounted. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.

Then (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n... and so on.\n\nWait, actually, each layer adds another \"1+3(\" until the ninth layer. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any calculation errors, as I verified each step and even used a different method (the recursive formula) to confirm the result. So, yeah, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. If a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers: For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3n where n is the previous layer. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, solving this recurrence relation might give a closed-form expression, but maybe it's easier to just compute each term as I did before. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Now, 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the computations.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for any errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Alternatively, I might recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The standard solution method for such a recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if I messed up any layer, the final answer would be wrong.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, yes, each layer is correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me try computing a couple of layers again. For example, Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, yes, each step is correct, so the final answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. But just for fun, let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fraction, but our initial terms are integers, so maybe this approach isn't directly helpful, or perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the recurrence as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 1, which is a constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2, as before. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution also leads us to the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so it's a geometric series maybe? Let's see. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is actually 1 + 3, which is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, etc. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = (c*r^{n} - c)/(r - 1). Wait, let me check that. Actually, the standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. The solution is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, r=3, c=1, and a_1=4. Let's see if I can use this formula. So, a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, but I think the formula is a bit different. Let me derive it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. Let's find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've got it right. Just to make sure, let me do a quick recap: Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, starting from 4. Using the formula, the 9th layer is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88572. Yep, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me check if I did the layers correctly because that's a lot of steps and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without doing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with nine layers. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result. This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps, using the method for solving linear recurrences. The recurrence relation is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, the nth layer Ln is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So the outermost layer is L9. Therefore, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize that each layer is part of a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the layers grow exponentially. But in this case, since each layer adds 1 before multiplying by 3, it's a bit different. However, the formula I derived seems to handle it correctly. Therefore, I can be confident that the final result is 88572. Just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3 * 29524 again: 29524 * 3. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 * 3 = 15.

So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do multiple layers, I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check that 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with multiple layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it as a recurrence.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me check that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: at n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, as computed earlier.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which is the same as before.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which might have saved some time if I had noticed the pattern earlier. But since I didn't, I just computed each layer step by step, and it worked out correctly.\n\nJust to make sure, let me verify one more layer using the formula. Let's take n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2=364. Which is correct as per earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can compute each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward, recognizing a pattern that allows us to use a formula for the nth term.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{previous term})\\).

But let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9.

Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, finally, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, if we denote the entire expression as E = 3*L_9, then E = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, E = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Perfect, same result. So, using the formula, I can directly compute the answer without computing each layer step by step. That's much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for this problem, since there are only nine layers, computing step by step is manageable, but it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic, so using the formula is safer. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could save time. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step, which could have saved time, especially if there were more layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me substitute into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Suppose L_{n} = A*3^n + B. Then, L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 (n=9) would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's a good consistency check. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the formula. This might have saved time if I had recognized the pattern earlier, but step-by-step computation also worked. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Hmm, but let me check my layers again because sometimes when I compute step by step, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers.

So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). How many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nEach time, it's another layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3(...) occurs. From the expression, each time you have a 1+3(...), and there are nine of them, right? Because it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I think I did it correctly, computing up to Layer 9 as 29524 and then multiplying by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. For example, let's take a smaller version with just two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute this manually.\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, outermost: 3*13 = 39.\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nNow, using my method, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, then 3*13=39. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). That's three layers.\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nLet me compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for smaller cases, so I think it's correct for the nine-layer problem.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost nine layers, the final result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Compute Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n10. Multiply by 3: 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I thought Layer 9 was 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. So, is that the final answer? Let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if the original expression has nine layers. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each time it's wrapped in another 1 + 3(...). So, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" before the first closing parenthesis. Wait, maybe another approach: Each time we have a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new layer. So starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is layer 1. Then, 1 + 3(layer1) is layer2, and so on until layer9, which is the outermost. So, yes, nine layers. So, my computation was correct up to layer9, and then multiplied by 3, giving 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it step by step again, or maybe find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to do each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, recursively, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous one. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as I did before. So, perhaps this is a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer9, which is the outermost, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see: The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which is similar to a geometric series but not exactly. Let me think. Let's denote the innermost expression as a base case. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but in our case, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each next term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute the terms up to a_9, since there are nine layers. So, a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Let's test for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with our previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. But let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nThen, (59049 -1)=59048. 59048 divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 29524 *3: Let me compute that again. 29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 *3 can be calculated as 29524*3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4)*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12 = 60000+27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you're dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So starting from the first one: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of '1 + 3(...' sections. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) : The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me see. The innermost expression is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of times '1 + 3(' appears. Starting from the innermost, each time we have '1 + 3(', so:\n\n1. 1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nWait, but the expression ends with '1 + 3)))))))', so there are nine '1 + 3(' instances, meaning nine layers. So, my initial calculation was correct: Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait a moment, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, but let me make sure that each step was correct. Let me go through each layer again to confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 29524 * 3 = 88572, which I verified earlier. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can model this as a recurrence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's compute a few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's exactly the same as before. So, the ninth term is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our case, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nThis gives me even more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and the repeating pattern.\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n3. Notice the recurrence relation and derive a closed-form formula.\n4. Use the formula to compute the nth term efficiently.\n5. Multiply the final term by 3 as per the original expression.\n6. Verify the result using multiple methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing recurrence relations. It also showed the power of finding a closed-form solution to avoid computing each term step by step, especially useful if the number of layers were much larger.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified the result thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step and recognizing the recurrence relation, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using the closed-form formula for the nth term of the sequence, we determine the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or something, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. But just to make sure, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric progression but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Wait, actually, each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. So, starting from the innermost term, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote a_n as the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might help. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, let's rearrange: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10}/2) -1/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Each step seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula to compute this without doing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have nine layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, each time we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which can be thought of as building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Wait, but in this case, each term is multiplied by 3 each time, so it's a geometric progression with ratio 3. The total expression can be considered as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. However, since the series is finite (nine layers), it's a finite geometric series. Wait, but the formula for a finite geometric series is S_n = a1*(r^n -1)/(r -1). But in this case, the structure is a bit different because each term is nested. Let me think. If I have S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with n layers, then S = 1 + 3*S', where S' is the same structure with n-1 layers. This is similar to the recurrence relation I had earlier. So, the approach I took before is correct. So, with n=9, the innermost layer is 1+3=4, and each subsequent layer adds a 3*(previous layer) +1. So, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 is the right way to compute it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from 1, each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1. This is similar to a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. The general formula for such a recurrence relation is a bit involved, but perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula to compute it directly. Let me think: If I have a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I computed. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4. Then Layer 2 is a_2=13, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula for a_9, which is (3^{10}-1)/2, then multiply by 3: 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my step-by-step computation, and the formula approach confirms it. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because if any of those layers were computed incorrectly, the final answer would be off. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something, but since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's more like a recursive sequence. Let me think if there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each layer. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer. Since the expression has nine layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Either way, the result is the same. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).
