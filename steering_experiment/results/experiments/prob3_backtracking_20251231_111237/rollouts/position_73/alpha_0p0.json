    "text": " 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524 Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let me assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Then, substituting into the equation: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Now, equate both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D Subtract D from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2D => 2D = -1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the solution is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me double-check the multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 88572. Correct. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions to avoid computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, noticing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Wait, but let me double-check all the layers because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient and less error-prone. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So each time, we're multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, but actually, in our case, L_1 was 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous). So, the recursive formula is indeed L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it more efficiently and avoid the step-by-step computation, which is helpful, especially if there were more layers. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could save a lot of time. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step correctly, that's reassuring. So, just to recap, the process was: 1. Identify that the expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). 2. Start computing from the innermost layer outward. 3. Alternatively, recognize the recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution to compute the value more efficiently. 4. Finally, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. It's always good to check the result using a different method if possible, as I did here, to ensure that the answer is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

For the 9th layer, this gives L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me just double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer1: 4 Layer2: 1 + 3*4=13 Layer3:1 +3*13=40 Layer4:1 +3*40=121 Layer5:1 +3*121=364 Layer6:1 +3*364=1093 Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280 Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841 Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524 Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without doing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572. I think that's solid.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572, correct. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake anywhere. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093). Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280). Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841). Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, finally, 3*29524. Let's compute 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4, so 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 +12=88572. Correct. So, after double-checking each step, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting with the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed and used in the next layer. After computing the innermost layers up to the outermost layer, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my computations because sometimes when you have so many layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula for such nested expressions. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for C and D.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize that this expression is similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added to 1 repeatedly. However, in this case, since it's finite with 9 layers, the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and the repeating pattern.\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost one.\n3. Alternatively, model the problem using a recurrence relation and solve it.\n4. Verify the result by computing the final multiplication.\n\nI think I've covered all the necessary steps, and both methods led me to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost. The recurrence relation is:\n\\[ a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\]\nwith the initial condition \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n- Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times the result of the outermost layer:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer step by step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Substitute the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, 0 = 2B + 1 => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11 = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula instead of computing each layer step by step. It's good to verify it both ways to be sure. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that each layer follows the pattern $1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}$.

Yes, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so the total number of layers is 9, but when I computed Layer 9, I had 1 + 3*(Layer 8), which gave me 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives the final answer. So yes, that seems right. Let me check if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let's see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that's applicable here. The initial condition is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4. Let's plug into the general solution: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, let's find a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, from the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

    "text": " 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as a recurrence. Let's define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recurrence. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I compute a_9, then multiply by 3, I get the result. Let me compute a_1 through a_9 again to be thorough: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with a_1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th term, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 59049*3 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the closed-form formula, I end up with the same final answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer and ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, and a_{n}=1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier results to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. Using the recurrence relation formula, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula to the 9th layer gives us 29524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's add them: 29524 +29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 +29524: 59048 +20000=79048; 79048 +9000=88048; 88048 +500=88548; 88548 +24=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the computation is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding them step by step is manageable. However, for better understanding, perhaps recognizing the pattern would help. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1+39=40. Which is similar to a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without expanding each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But since this problem only has nine layers, both methods work. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1: a1=4, n=2: a2=13, n=3:40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. Assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Simplify: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. So, a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition. When n=1, a1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A=4 + 1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation.

Wait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive relation where each term is based on the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found, but since I only have nine terms, computing each step manually is feasible. Alternatively, the closed-form solution for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4 can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me try to find a pattern or formula. Let's see, expanding a few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 9*4 = 1 + 3 + 12 = 16? Wait, no, that's not matching my earlier calculation. Wait, no, my earlier calculation for a_3 was 40. Wait, I'm confused. Let me clarify. Wait, in the problem, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, but in my problem, each a_n is 1 + 3*(previous a). So, for example: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, the pattern is each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Now, to find a closed-form formula for a_n, I can solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, in this case, our recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c=3 and d=1. So, the general solution is a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4. Let me adjust the indices. Let me consider n starting at 1. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. So, the general solution for a_n would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But since a_1 = 4, when n=1, a_1 = 3^{1} * a_0 + (3^{1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3*a_0 + (3 - 1)/2 = 3*a_0 + 1. But a_1 = 4, so 3*a_0 + 1 = 4 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. So, the general formula is a_n = 3^{n} * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me simplify that: a_n = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 =4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29524, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, since the formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the layers. I think I did each step correctly, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, but let me double-check each layer because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the previous steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, 3*1=3, so 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me see if I can model this as a recursive sequence. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recursion. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Since we have 9 layers, we can think of a_9 as the innermost term, but wait, actually, in the expression, it's 3*(a_9). Wait, let me check: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*a_1 = a_2 = 13, and so on, up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursion a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since it's a nonhomogeneous recurrence, we can solve it using standard techniques. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I found earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, and the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe we can represent this recursively. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). With L(1) = 4. Then, L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L(n) = A*3^n + B. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4. So, when n=1, L(1)=4: A*3^1 - 1/2 = 4 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplify: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly. Since L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring.

    "text": " 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1 +3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3:29524*3=88572. That seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each time, it's 1 +3(...). So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers because each time you have a 1 +3(...), and each time you go outward, you add another layer. So, 9 layers in total. So, my computation from Layer1 to Layer9 is correct, resulting in 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L1, then L1 = 1 +3 =4. Then L2 =1 +3*L1 =1 +3*4=13. L3=1 +3*L2=1 +3*13=40. L4=1 +3*L3=1 +3*40=121. L5=1 +3*L4=1 +3*121=364. L6=1 +3*L5=1 +3*364=1093. L7=1 +3*L6=1 +3*1093=3280. L8=1 +3*L7=1 +3*3280=9841. L9=1 +3*L8=1 +3*9841=29524. So, yes, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive relation is L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since n is small (only 9), it's easier to compute step by step. But for learning purposes, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B =1 +3*B => B -3B=1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check for n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L9= (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each step, and even found a formula to compute the layers, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of the form 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the result is 29,524. Multiplying this by the outermost factor of 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my calculations for each layer because that seems like a big number, and I don't want to make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the problem is to compute a_9, and then multiply by 3. Wait, actually, in my earlier approach, I computed a_1 up to a_9, but the original expression is 3*(a_9). Hmm. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can solve it. Let's see, the general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it step by step, used a recurrence relation, and even derived a formula to compute it directly. All methods point to the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So each \"1+\" is a new layer.

Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the final answer is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for L_n, we can express the entire expression as 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations in the step-by-step approach.

But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I could recognize instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable. I wonder if this is a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence might give a formula, but since it's only nine terms, computing each is feasible. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + initial term. Wait, let me check that. The homogeneous solution is for a_n = r*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = a_0*r^n. For the particular solution when it's a constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = c + r*K => K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular, which is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r). Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*r^1 + c/(1 - r). So, A*r + c/(1 - r) = 4. Solving for A: A = (4 - c/(1 - r)) / r. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, since each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, we can compute a_n step by step as I did earlier. But just to see, maybe I can find a formula. Let me try to compute a few terms and see if a pattern emerges. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, these numbers are growing quite rapidly. Each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the ratio between terms is approaching 3, but each time, it's 3 times the previous plus 1. So, perhaps the closed-form formula is a_n = (3^n + 1)/2. Wait, let me test that. For n=1: (3^1 + 1)/2 = (3 + 1)/2 = 4/2 = 2. But a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe another formula. Alternatively, let's see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 3 + 1 a_2 = 13 = 3*4 + 1 a_3 = 40 = 3*13 + 1 a_4 = 121 = 3*40 + 1, etc. So, each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, the general formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1))/2, but I might be mixing up the formula. Alternatively, solving the recurrence relation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant, a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our problem, we have Layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, but let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have been time-consuming. Let me think if there's a better way to approach this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as each layer, then each L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So that confirms the answer. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each time you add another layer, you're effectively multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series. But in this case, since each term is built upon the previous one, the recursive formula was more straightforward. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recount each layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.

Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So this is a recursive relation. If I can find a closed-form formula for L_n, that might make things easier instead of computing each layer manually. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me substitute into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Plugging in the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, subtract 3B from both sides: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4. So: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, A = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since our expression has 9 layers, the outermost Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start. Since the outermost layer is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid.

Wait, but let me check if I did the layers correctly, because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can model this as a recursive sequence. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I can compute 3^{10} directly: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the formula using the recurrence relation gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000 +600=9600 +240=9840 +0=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try to find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. This is a recurrence relation, and maybe I can solve it to find a general formula. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P =1 => P = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4. Solving for A: 3A =4 +1/2 = 9/2. So A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048 /2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144 /2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, I found that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that, eventually leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allowed me to find a formula, which also led me to the same answer. This makes me confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Each layer builds upon the previous one, and the multiplication by 3 at each step leads to the next layer. It's interesting how each layer's value increases so rapidly. I think the key here was to not get overwhelmed by the number of layers but to tackle each one step by step, starting from the innermost part. It's like peeling an onion; each layer comes off one at a time until you reach the outermost part. So, by methodically computing each nested expression, I was able to arrive at the final result without getting lost in the complexity of the problem. I guess the main takeaway is that even though the expression looks intimidating with all those parentheses, breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts makes it solvable. It's also a good reminder of the importance of careful step-by-step computation to avoid mistakes, especially when dealing with multiple layers of operations. I didn't make any calculation errors this time, so that's reassuring. It just goes to show how crucial it is to double-check each step, especially when dealing with repetitive patterns like this one.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use here to avoid computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be expressed recursively. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p.\n\nWait, that gives L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => 0 = 1 + 2*L_p => L_p = -1/2. Hmm, that seems odd, but let's proceed.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40.

So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

    "text": " 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series in disguise. Let me see if I can model it as such. Let's define each layer as a term in the series. Let me denote a_n as the value at the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3a_2. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_{k} = 1 + 3a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. Hmm, that's a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_k = c + r*a_{k-1}, which in this case, c=1, r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_k = A*r^{k} + (c/(r - 1)). Let me recall the formula. For a linear recurrence relation like a_k = r*a_{k-1} + c, the solution is a_k = A*r^{k} + d, where d is a constant. To find d, set a_k = d, then d = r*d + c => d = c/(1 - r). Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}. So, r=3, c=1. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{k}, and the particular solution is d = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. Wait, but that doesn't seem to fit with our initial terms. Let me check. The general solution is a_k = A*3^{k} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At k=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For k=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for k=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different approaches\u2014computing each layer step by step and finding a closed-form formula\u2014both lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula, confirming the result. The final computation gives:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me just double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 =1 +39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.

But just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let's see. The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, and each subsequent a_{n+1} =1 + 3*a_n. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, let me compute a_1 to a_9 again to confirm. a1=4. a2=1 +3*4=13. a3=1 +3*13=40. a4=1 +3*40=121. a5=1 +3*121=364. a6=1 +3*364=1093. a7=1 +3*1093=3280. a8=1 +3*3280=9841. a9=1 +3*9841=29524. Then, 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think. The recurrence relation is a_{n+1} =1 + 3*a_n, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can solve it using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} =3*a_n, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K =1 + 3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1=4. So, when n=1, a1=4= C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2. Solving for C: 3C =4 +1/2=9/2. So, C=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, this formula works perfectly. Therefore, a9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form expression, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I can conclude that the computed value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, eventually leading to the outermost layer. Using the closed-form formula for the sequence, we confirm that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again just to be sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3A => A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer manually, just to confirm. Let's see, each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's substitute L_n into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate the terms: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the previous layer can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, it's a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see: If I expand Layer 9: L_9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to 9 layers. So, expanding it, it would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. Wait, but that seems to be a geometric series with 9 terms, starting from 3^0 up to 3^8. The sum of a geometric series is (r^n - 1)/(r - 1). So, the sum S = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier we had L_9 = 29524, which is much larger. Hmm, perhaps my approach here is incorrect. Wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a different structure. Let me check: If I expand Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1. Layer 2: L2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2. Layer 3: L3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}. So, the sum up to 3^{n-1}. Therefore, for Layer 9, it's the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. But earlier, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which is different. So, something's wrong here. Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect. Let me check with Layer 1: According to this, L1 = sum from k=0 to 0 of 3^k = 1. But earlier, L1 was 1 + 3 = 4. So, there's a discrepancy. Therefore, perhaps the expansion isn't a simple geometric series. Alternatively, maybe each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which when expanded is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to a certain power, but perhaps the number of terms is different. Let me try to expand Layer 2: L2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Which is 1 + 3 + 3^2. So, three terms. Layer 3: L3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Four terms. So, each layer adds another term. Therefore, Layer n would have n+1 terms, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n. Wait, but for Layer 1, n=1, so terms would be 3^0 and 3^1, summing to 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2, n=2: 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Correct. So, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, that's the same formula I derived earlier. So, for Layer 9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my initial computation. So, perhaps when I thought of expanding it as a geometric series up to 3^8, that was incorrect because the number of terms is actually up to 3^9 for Layer 9. Wait, no, because if Layer 9 is the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, that would be (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is correct. So, I think I confused myself earlier when I considered up to 3^8, but actually, it's up to 3^9. So, that aligns with the formula. Therefore, the total expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, after going through both the step-by-step computation and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.

Let me double-check my layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me see if I can model this. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to the innermost layer: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me recount. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one. Let's count the number of innermost expressions: Each time we have (1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is Layer1:1+3. Then Layer2:1+3*(Layer1), Layer3:1+3*(Layer2), up to Layer9:1+3*(Layer8). Because each time we go out a layer, we add another 1+3*(...). So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So, total layers from innermost to outermost: 9 layers. So, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer9 result I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute using the formula for n=1 up to n=9 and see if each layer matches my previous results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, all layers computed via the formula match my step-by-step. Thus, the final computation is 3*29524=88572. I think that's solid. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Hmm, but let me check my calculations again because this seems a bit high. Maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So the last layer is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3/2) - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81/2) - 1/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, a_9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding each layer, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If I expand all the layers, it would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, but wait, that's not quite right because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, let me see: Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) If I expand the innermost parentheses first: Let me define the innermost expression as E_1 = 1 + 3. Then, moving out, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1. Then E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2, and so on up to E_9, and then E = 3*E_9. So, as we saw earlier, E_9 = 29524, so E = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for E without computing each layer. Since each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, and E_1 = 4, as we saw earlier, and the general formula is E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For n=1, E_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2, E_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. So, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression E =3*E_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this makes sense. Each time, the expression is building up a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3, and the sum is being scaled accordingly. So, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with the recurrence relation, and then using the general formula for the nth term, I arrive at the same answer each time. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Because if any layer is wrong, the entire result will be off. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Let me see if I can model this. Let me denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined recursively. Let\u2019s say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - r*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation k - r = 0, so k = r. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = c + r*A => A - r*A = c => A*(1 - r) = c => A = c/(1 - r). However, in this case, r=3, which is greater than 1, so 1 - r = -2, so A = 1/(-2) = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*(3)^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's see: a_1 = C*(3)^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*(3)^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10 first. 3^1 = 3 3^2 =9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, then adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and so on. So, it's like a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an added 1 each step. The formula I derived earlier helps generalize this, avoiding the need to compute each layer manually, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, computing step by step isn't too bad, as long as I'm careful to avoid arithmetic errors. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, multiply by 3:3*29524=88572. Yes, that all checks out. So, I think I've got the correct answer here. Just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly: Layer1:1+3=4. Layer2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. 3*29524=88572. Yep, consistent every time. So, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be generalized using a formula for linear recurrences. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"
