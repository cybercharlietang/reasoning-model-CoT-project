    "text": " Let's break it down. 3 * 29,524. 3 * 20,000 = 60,000; 3 * 9,000 = 27,000; 3 * 500 = 1,500; 3 * 24 = 72. So adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So the total would be 88,572. Hmm, but wait a minute. Let me check that again because I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Wait, how many layers are there? The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, how many 1+3(...) are there? Let me count: Each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, each subsequent 1+3(...) adds another layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then, the next layer is Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1). Then Layer 3: 1+3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost one. So, in total, there are 9 layers of 1+3*(...). Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3, I get 88,572. But let me make sure that each step was correct because it's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers. Let me go through each layer again step by step, computing each one carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a general formula.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 = 29,524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29,524 again.\n\n29,524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step.\n\n29,524\n*      3\n--------\nFirst, 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n--------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 72 = 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Hmm, let me verify that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in counting the layers. Let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3*(...) parts. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds a 3*(...). Let's count them: 1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(...)\n3. 1+3*(...)\n...\nUp to the ninth layer. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try again. Let me parse the expression:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"1+3(\" segments: Starting from the first, each one adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, each adding a new 3*(...). So, my earlier calculation is correct, with Layer 9 being 29524, and the final answer being 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 88572 seems quite large. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nLet's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just noticed something. The original expression is 3 times the ninth layer, but each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the first layer is 1 + 3, the second is 1 + 3*(first layer), and so on, up to the ninth layer, which is 1 + 3*(eighth layer). Then, the entire expression is 3*(ninth layer). So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the ninth layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the formula applies here. Since each a_n is defined as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, and we have a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10} or something, but I think the step-by-step approach is solid here.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by breaking down the nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, which is the one before the final multiplication by 3.

So, I think I did it correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or a recurrence relation.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nL_1 = 4\nL_2 = 13\nL_3 = 40\nL_4 = 121\nL_5 = 364\nL_6 = 1093\nL_7 = 3280\nL_8 = 9841\nL_9 = 29524\n\nI notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1.

The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\nYes, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this is correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure consistency.\n\nFor n=1: L1=(3^2 -1)/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=9: L9=(3^10 -1)/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll correct. Therefore, the computation is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and applying the formula for the nth layer, we find the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me break it down. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and 2. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, 2*3=6, but wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3=88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 +12=88572. Okay, so that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me recount each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of recursive expression. The general form is a recurrence relation: a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see, solving this recurrence relation might give me a direct formula instead of computing each layer. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_{k} - 3a_{k-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is a_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so k=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can also check with a smaller number of layers to see if the formula works. For example, if there was only 1 layer: 3*(1+3)=3*4=12. Using the formula: a_1=4, then 3*a_1=12. Correct. If there are two layers: 3*(1+3*(1+3))=3*(1+3*4)=3*(1+12)=3*13=39. Using the formula: a_2=13, 3*a_2=39. Correct. Three layers: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))=3*(1+3*4)=3*(1+12)=3*13=39. Wait, no, wait: Wait, three layers would be 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))). Let's compute that: Innermost:1+3=4, middle:1+3*4=13, outer:1+3*13=40, then 3*40=120. Using the formula: a_3=40, 3*a_3=120. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 27 (from the first digit) followed by 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that seems off. Let me check again. Maybe I should do it more carefully. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Finally, the leftmost digit: 9*3=27. So putting it all together, starting from the left: 27, then 8, then 8, then 5, then 7, then 2. Wait, that can't be right because the digits should be in the correct order. Let me write it down vertically:\n\n```\n    29524\n  x     3\n  --------\n```\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 27.\n\nSo reading the result from top to bottom: 27 (from the 9*3), then 8 (from the 2*3), then 8 (from the 9*3 + carry), then 5 (from the 5*3), then 7 (from the 2*3), and finally 2 (from the 4*3). Wait, that would make the number 278,572? Let me check with another method. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my earlier calculation. Let me try another approach. 29524 * 3: Break it down as 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So the correct result should be 88,572. I must have messed up the earlier digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try that again. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nFinally, the leftmost digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 27.\n\nWait, but when writing the digits, the 27 from the leftmost digit should be placed before the 8, right? So the number would be 27 followed by 8, then 8, then 5, then 7, then 2. That would make 278,8572? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, each digit is a single place, so let me list them correctly:\n\nAfter multiplying each digit and carrying over, the result is:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- Units place: 2\n- Tens place: 7\n- Hundreds place: 5\n- Thousands place: 8\n- Ten-thousands place: 8\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2 and 7 (from 27), but wait, that's not possible because each digit can only be a single digit. I think I'm getting confused here. Let me write it properly:\n\nWhen you multiply 29524 by 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carry 0\n- 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2, but wait, there's no more digits, so we write 27 as 2 and 7 in the next higher places.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when you multiply by 3, the result should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me write it step by step:\n\nMultiply each digit:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 units place is 2, carryover 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens place is 7, carryover 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place is 5, carryover 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands place is 8, carryover 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten-thousands place is 8, carryover 0\n- Finally, the 9 (which is in the hundred-thousands place) * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7 in the hundred-thousands place and carryover 2, but since there are no more digits, we write 2 in the next higher place, making it a 6-digit number: 27...\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 is 5 digits, so 3*29524 should be 88572, which is 5 digits. So maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me confirm:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n29524\n+29524\n+29524\n---------\nLet's add the first two:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4+4=8\n2+2=4\n5+5=10, write 0, carryover 1\n9+9=18 +1=19, write 9, carryover 1\n2+2=4 +1=5\n\nSo 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow add 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048\n+29524\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n8+4=12, write 2, carryover 1\n4+2=6 +1=7\n0+5=5\n9+9=18, write 8, carryover 1\n5+2=7 +1=8\n5+ nothing=5\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was trying to compute it digit by digit, I was getting confused. It's better to use the addition method to avoid confusion. So the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation again, just to be thorough.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that all checks out. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(...), so the total expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I went through each layer step by step, double-checked the computations, and even verified the final multiplication by adding the number three times. Everything seems to add up correctly. So I'm confident that the solution is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, but that seems high. Let me verify my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 *3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I feel like that's a big number. Let me check the number of layers again. The original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost, each set adds another layer. Let's see: The innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, the expression is: 3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms. Starting from the innermost: 1. (1+3) 2. (1+3(...)) 3. (1+3(...)) ... Up to how many? Let's see, each time we add another layer. The innermost is the first, then each time we go out, we add another. So, in the original expression, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: The expression is 3 followed by (1+3(...)), and each subsequent (1+3(...)) has another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The first one is (1+3(...)), then each subsequent one adds another. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3. Then layer 2: 1+3*(layer1). Up to layer 9: 1+3*(layer8). So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, my earlier calculation of 9 layers is correct, leading to Layer9=29524, and then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I just feel like that's a very large number. Let me try an alternative approach to see if I can find a pattern or formula that might make this easier. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1=1+3=4, L2=1+3*L1, L3=1+3*L2, and so on up to L9. So, each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me consider the recursion: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as we had earlier. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer9, which is n=9: L9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, Layer9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since each Layer n is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, and the total expression is 3*(Layer9). So, 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11}-3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning now. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27. So putting it all together: 27, then 8, then 5, then 7, then 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, perhaps I should do it more carefully. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me confirm with another method. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3.\n\n29000 * 3 = 87,000.\n\n524 * 3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 1500+72=1572.\n\nAdding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that matches the previous result. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let's go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern, perhaps a geometric series or something similar, but given the time I've spent computing each layer step by step, and verifying each computation, I think 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression using another approach. Let me try to see if there's a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let's denote each nested expression as a_i, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWe can see that each a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_i.\n\nThe recurrence is a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^i.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_i = C*3^i - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when i=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor i=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\ni=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\ni=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\ni=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_i = (3^{i+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for i=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've computed each layer step by step, checked each computation, then found a general formula using recurrence relations, and confirmed that it gives the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term.

Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, when I computed Layer 9, that was the innermost expression, and each subsequent layer is built upon that. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, for each layer, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Then, we can find a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}.\n\nAssume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, and we have 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both methods, step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost.

So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with the carries.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3 as follows:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 90000 - 1428.\n\nWait, 30000 \u00d7 3 = 90000.\n\nBut 29524 is 30000 - 476, so 29524 \u00d7 3 = 90000 - (476 \u00d7 3) = 90000 - 1428.\n\nCompute 90000 - 1428:\n\n90000 - 1000 = 89000\n\n89000 - 428 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make an error in one of the layers, which would throw off all subsequent computations.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step adds up correctly. So, I think my computations are accurate.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since the expression is finite with nine layers, computing each layer step by step seems straightforward.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize that each layer follows the recurrence relation:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nwith L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check if this formula works with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for layer 9, L(9)=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572, as calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for L(n), the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. \n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524, so 3*29524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help compute this without expanding each layer manually. Let's see. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This looks like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. If I denote each Layer n as a_n, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3a_1\na_3 = 1 + 3a_2\n...\na_9 = 1 + 3a_8\n\nThis is a recurrence relation where each term is defined by the previous one. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2, but let me verify if that's the case here.\n\nWait, let me test it. For a_1, which is 4:\n\n(3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1, which is not 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test that:\n\nFor a_1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, so the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n starts at 1. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression using this formula. Since the original expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then:\n\n3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, using the formula, I get the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations with the exponents. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, and 3^11=177147. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^11 is indeed 177147, subtract 3 gives 177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nSo, both methods\u2014expanding each layer step by step and using the formula\u2014give me the same result, which is 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that this is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to ensure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to check. Let's go back to Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carryover 2\nSince there are no more digits, write down the 2.\n\nWait, that gives me 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524, which is correct. Then, 3*29524 is 88572 as before.\n\nYes, everything checks out. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem, the expression is 3*(...), so that's 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series or another approach, but since I already have a formula and verified each step, I think this is solid.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nEach layer a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nFor n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the initial layers. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the total would be 88,572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. But wait, let me check if I correctly identified the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times ... ))). So, each layer is indeed one more 3*(...) inside. So, nine layers in total, starting from the innermost as Layer 1. So, my calculation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or check if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something similar because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_i, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the sequence is a recursive one, where each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to find a general formula for a_n. Since each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, plugging n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is indeed 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1 is 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3=88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, all my steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus three times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.

    "text": " Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27. So putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me write it out vertically:\n\n  29524\n*      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nFinally, the leftmost digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 27.\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct that. Wait, actually, the number is 29524, which is a 5-digit number. So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nAnd the leftmost digit is 2 * 3 = 6, but wait, the number is 29524, so the digits are 2,9,5,2,4. So when I multiply each digit:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n- 5 *3=15 \u21925, carry1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carry0.\n- And there's no digit beyond 2, so the final carryover is 0, so we just write 8.\n\nWait, so putting it together, it's 88572. Wait, but when I write it out:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carry1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify this with another method. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 *3 =60000.\n\n9000 *3=27000.\n\n500 *3=1500.\n\n20*3=60.\n\n4*3=12.\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000.\n\n87000 +1500=88500.\n\n88500 +60=88560.\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that checks out. So 29524 *3=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check that because if that's wrong, the entire answer will be wrong.\n\nSo let's go back step by step to compute each layer correctly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so Layer9 is indeed 29524, so multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n... and so on.\n\nWait, actually, in the original problem, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers, each adding another 3(...). So my initial computation of 9 layers is correct. So Layer1 is the innermost, Layer9 is the outermost. So when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, that's correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make an error. Let me compute Layer9 again step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors in any of the layers.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, all layers check out. So the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_1=4\n\na_2=1 +3*4=13\n\na_3=1 +3*13=40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe standard form is a_n + c1*a_{n-1} + ... = f(n).\n\nIn this case, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nTo solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C +1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2)=3A -1/2.\n\nSo, 4=3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we also arrive at the same result, which confirms that our step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was working through it step by step, it was a good exercise.\n\nIn summary, by computing each nested layer from the inside out and verifying with a recurrence relation formula, I arrived at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next nested term).\n\n2. **Compute from the innermost layer outward**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 =1 +3=4. a_2=1 +3*a1=1+12=13. a_3=1 +3*a2=1 +39=40. So, each a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =3*C +1 => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Divide by 2: 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, multiplying by 3: 29,524 *3. Let's compute this again to be sure. 29,524 *3: 20,000*3=60,000 9,000*3=27,000 500*3=1,500 20*3=60 4*3=12 Adding up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000 +1,500=88,500 +60=88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, then L1=1+3=4, L2=1+3*L1=1+12=13, L3=1+3*L2=1+39=40, and so on. This seems like a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. The general form is a recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Assuming L(n) = A*3^n + B, then L(n-1)=A*3^(n-1) + B. Substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate the coefficients: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L(1)=4. L(1)=A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2)/2 -1/2 = 9/2 -1/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L(2)= (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3)= (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L(9)= (3^10)/2 -1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, L(9)=59,049/2 -1/2= (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29,524=88,572. So, using both methods\u2014direct computation and the closed-form formula\u2014I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Maybe there's a formula for that. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. We know that a_1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, as n approaches infinity, if we consider the behavior, but since our n is finite, maybe we can use another method. Alternatively, we can solve it using iteration. Let's see:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier. So, the approach is correct. Therefore, multiplying a_9 by 3 gives the final result. So, 3*29524 = 88572.

    "text": " Let's break it down. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 3*3=9 +2=11. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.

So putting it all together: 11 7 8 5 7 2. Wait, that seems off. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try another way. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large quickly, and I want to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake. Let me try another approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression inside the outermost parentheses is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...)), which is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can represent this recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, the recurrence relation is a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9. So, I can compute a_1 to a_9 using the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven that, let's compute them again:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since the recurrence is a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's solve for C. Assuming a steady-state solution, where a_{n+1} = a_n = C. Then, C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems to confirm the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) as a geometric series. Let me think about it. The expression inside is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me denote S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))}. But wait, that S is actually equal to a_9, which we've already computed. So, S = a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*S = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's expand this step by step, starting from the innermost part.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, each step confirms the previous result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula also gives the same result, so I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\) and each subsequent layer is computed as \\( a_{n+1} = 1 + 3a_n \\).\n\n1.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000; 9000 * 3 = 27000; 500 * 3 = 1500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that still gives me 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could use another method to verify, like recognizing a pattern or using a formula for a geometric series, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which resembles a geometric progression. Let me explore that approach as a check. The expression inside each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation would be r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier result. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct. I think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So, 20000 + 9000 = 29000, +500=29500, +20=29520, +4=29524. Now, 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Now add them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me verify each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. As I did earlier, 29,524 * 3: Let me compute it again. 20,000*3=60,000. 9,000*3=27,000. 500*3=1,500. 20*3=60. 4*3=12. Now, add them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 directly: 29,524 * 3. Let me write it out:\n\n29,524  \n\u00d7        3  \n----------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. I just realized something. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, the way I approached it was correct because I started from the innermost parentheses and worked my way out. Each step, I computed the value inside the parentheses first before moving outward. That method should give the correct result.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can try a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach works. Let's say I have a simpler version with only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute this using my method.\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOutermost layer: 3*13 = 39.\n\nNow, let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute using my method.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nCompute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(4)) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39? Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in this case, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. But if I compute directly, 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, my method works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem.\n\nTherefore, I think my step-by-step approach is valid, and the final answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me try computing another layer to see if I can find a pattern or perhaps a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see if there's a recursive formula here. Each layer n is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer (n-1)). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for Layer n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nLayer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: n=4, a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works for the layers I computed. Therefore, I can use this formula to compute any layer without manually computing each step. That would have saved time for the larger problem.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer manually or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me even more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this problem is by recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each term inside the parentheses is 1 + 3*(something). If I expand the entire expression, it's a geometric series with a common ratio of 3.\n\nLet me try to write the entire expression as a sum.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLet me denote S as the entire expression: S = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me try to express S in terms of itself. Wait, but it's only nine layers deep, so perhaps it's better to see it as a finite geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have a formula for a_n, as we found earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and S = 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have expanded the entire expression step by step, which I did earlier, and it also gave me the same result.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each layer, verifying with a closed-form formula, and cross-checking with a smaller example, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a closed-form formula derived from a linear recurrence relation, we confirm the value of the innermost layers and compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems like a big number, but given how many layers there are, each time tripling the previous number, it might make sense.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a formula for a_n. The homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. The particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the result.

    "text": " Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60,000. 9000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait a minute, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count how many times 1+3 appears: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...), and I think there are 9 layers because there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)). Wait, but in my initial calculation, I went up to Layer 9, which was 29524. Then I multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But let me make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscount. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, I think my initial calculation was correct, with 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to verify. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n = 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, this confirms that my step-by-step calculation was correct. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then the final step: 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. So, I think my answer is right. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n, where n=1 is the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for such recursions. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Then, to find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, using both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation method, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using exponents directly. Since each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, starting from 4, perhaps there's a way to express the entire expression in terms of exponents of 3. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I denote the innermost part as x, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3x, and so on. But since I've already solved it using the recurrence, I think the step-by-step method is sufficient. Another way to think about it is that each layer is building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me try expanding the entire expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me expand each layer:\n\nStarting with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my previous calculations. So, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute each layer numerically again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYep, that all checks out. I think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence confirms that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final result of 88572 when multiplied by 3.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose I define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, and a_{n} =1 +3*a_{n-1}. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + 3*a_{n-1} =0, but wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is when the constant term is zero: a_n =3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A =3*A +1 => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1= C*3^1 -1/2 = 3C -1/2 =4. Solving for C: 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since I've derived a formula for a_n, I can compute it directly without computing each layer. But since the problem only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, but for more layers, the formula would be more efficient. Anyway, I think I've got the right answer here. Just to recap: I started from the innermost parentheses, computed each layer step by step, and then multiplied the outermost layer by 3. I also cross-verified using a recurrence relation formula to ensure that my answer was correct. So, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers. Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. This process is repeated until the outermost layer is reached, which is then multiplied by 3. \n\nHere's the step-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., then each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final computation is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly. Since a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), which forms a geometric series. Using the formula for the nth term of such a series, we find the innermost value and work our way out. Finally, multiplying the outermost result by 3 gives the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\), forming a geometric progression.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p +1 => a_p -3*a_p=1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So yes, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent.

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time to be sure. Maybe I can compute it in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3\u00d7previous layer. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtracting A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n-2B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, 3^{n+1}/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Good.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more using the formula.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute this without using the formula by observing that each step is 1 + 3*previous. So, perhaps I can compute each layer again quickly to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute this multiplication again to be absolutely sure.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 \u00d7 3 another way. Maybe by adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the value of the innermost expression, then multiply by 3 for the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost layer.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the outermost layer's value by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me verify my calculations because that seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers.

Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's see: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add step by step. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is indeed 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the expression starts with 3(1 + ...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. That seems right. But let me check the number of layers again to ensure I didn't miscount. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's count from the inside: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then each layer wraps around, so the total number of layers is 9, as I had before. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost one, and then multiplied by 3. So, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Write down 8.\nFinally, there are no more digits, so write down the carryover 0?

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because that would throw off the entire calculation.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think about this expression: It's a series of nested 1 + 3(...) terms. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis kind of recurrence can be solved using the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which in this case is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + (c*(r^{n} - 1))/(r - 1), but since the recurrence starts at a_1, I need to adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nWait, actually, the standard formula for a_n when a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n}*a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). But in our case, a_1 = 4, and a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, let me try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 3*a_1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13,\n\na_3 = 3*a_2 + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 40,\n\nand so on.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which also matches.\n\nGood, so the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I got before.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my step-by-step calculation was correct. It's always good to check using a different method to ensure that there are no mistakes. In this case, deriving the general formula for the recurrence relation helped solidify that the result is accurate.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me break it down. 29524 * 3. 24 * 3 = 72, so write down 2 and carry over 7. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 7 is 13. Write down 3, carry over 1. 5 * 3 = 15, plus 1 is 16. Write down 6, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. 2 * 3 = 6. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I did it step by step, I might have made a mistake. Let's do it more carefully. 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- The next digit is 2 (from 29524), which is actually the ten-thousands place, so 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, let's write it as:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 is the same as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, all the steps seem correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the expression simplifies to 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\). There are nine such layers, each adding another set of parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the outermost layer.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"
