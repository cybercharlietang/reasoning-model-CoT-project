Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering the number of layers, it might make sense. Let me verify my calculations step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting again, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

    "text": " 3 * 29,524. Well, 3 * 20,000 = 60,000. 3 * 9,524 = 28,572. Adding those together: 60,000 + 28,572 = 88,572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again because 3 * 29,524 should be 88,572. Hmm, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute an extra one. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. Next is (1+3( ... )) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. Then (1+3( ... )) \u2192 Layer 3\n... and so on until Layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, that was after 9 layers, but the original expression only has 8 layers beyond the initial 3(...). Let me recount the layers properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Each time it's a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nEach time I add another layer. Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to consider that each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new layer, and the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers inside the outermost 3(...). So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = 88,572. But wait, let me check each computation again to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I compute 3*29524, let me do it step by step to make sure:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72 \u2192 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first saw the problem, I thought maybe the layers were fewer, but I think my step-by-step approach is correct. Each layer is computed by taking 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from 4. So, after computing up to Layer 9 as 29,524, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me see: the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the innermost (1+3)=4, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time, I computed correctly. So, Layer 9 is 29,524, and 3*29,524 is 88,572.\n\nWait, but another way to think about this is that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive sequence.\n\nLet me think: If I denote a_n as the nth term, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, the final term is a_9 = 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since this is a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it that way. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing up to the ninth layer, which equals 29,524, we multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from the innermost (1+3).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Wait, but let me confirm my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n where a_1=1+3, a_2=1+3*a1, and so on up to a9. So, the general formula is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a1= (3^2)/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Because n=9, so a9=(3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=59049/2 -1/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to recognize this as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding each layer, we can write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me try to expand this expression step by step, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've found a closed-form solution, maybe that's the most efficient way. So, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which for n=9 gives a9=(3^{10}-1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a9=88572. So, all methods point to the same answer.

So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. As I did earlier, 29,524*3. Let me compute it again to be sure. 29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me write it out properly:\n\n29,524\n*        3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88,572. Wait, but 29,524 * 3: Let me compute 29,524 * 3 another way to confirm. 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, the pattern is clear: each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, that's consistent with my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I've double-checked each step, and even derived a formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.

Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364 * 3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29,524. Let me compute that carefully. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Now, adding these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers because sometimes when you have so many layers, it's easy to miscalculate. Let me check Layer 9 again: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9841*3. Let's compute 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, maybe it is correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute the value without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a nested multiplication, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider the general form. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n layers, we can write a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Substitute a_n = A*3^n + B: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract B from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2 Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4 Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying further: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n, up to n=9. Wait, let's check: If n=1, a_1 = 4. Then, n=2, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, which matches what I computed earlier. So, the closed-form formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10} first. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I think about the structure of the problem, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which is 3 times the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, but since it's finite, it's better to use the recurrence relation approach as I did earlier. Another way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is essentially 3 times the previous result plus 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 3*previous +1. But in this case, since it's nested, each step is built upon the previous one, so the recurrence approach is the right way to go. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. So, maybe my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check the number of layers again because I might have miscounted. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: Each \"1+3\" is one layer, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then, each subsequent (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost: 1+3 is the first, then each next layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me write it down:\n\n3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3)))))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1+3(, and each closing parenthesis reduces the nesting. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last 1+3, that's layer 1. Then, moving out, each time we have another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer1)\nLayer3: 1 +3(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer9: 1 +3(Layer8)\n\nBecause each time, we have another 1+3(...). So, total layers are 9. Therefore, when I computed up to Layer9, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when I do these step-by-step computations, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me verify each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the result of the ninth layer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me verify that because I might have made a mistake in the calculations. Alternatively, I can compute 3 * 29524 directly. Let me do that: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, reading the numbers from top to bottom: 7, 8, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that seems off. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carryover 0.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nWait, but 29524 has 5 digits, so when I multiply by 3, I should have:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carryover 0.\n\nWait, that's only 5 digits, so the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did it earlier, I thought of 29524 as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, but that might not be the right way. Let me check 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I thought it was 29,524, but let me check the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me go back to the layers step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29,524, which is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29,524, so 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572. So, that's the final answer.\n\nBut let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, the final computation is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, without layers, just to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThe homogeneous solution is when the nonhomogeneous term is zero: a_n = 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThe solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works for each layer. So, a_9 = 29,524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 =88,572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I can compute a_9 directly without computing each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut for this problem, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually was manageable, but it's good to know that a formula exists for future reference.\n\nIn summary, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. By either computing each layer step by step or finding a closed-form solution using the recurrence relation, we arrive at the final answer of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3**:\n   - Final Result: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 3*3=9. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe it's better to do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Finally, 3*3=9, write down 9. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 with carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 9*3=27, so 7 with carryover 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, so 7 with carryover 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. Finally, 3*3=9. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have missed a layer. Let me count the layers again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So yes, 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, L(1)=4, L(2)=13, L(3)=40, etc., as I computed before. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L(1)=4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's assume n=0: L(0)=1, since it's the base case before any layers. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is L(1)=4, which is 1 + 3. So maybe L(0)=1. Then, for n=0, L(0)=1 = A*3^0 + B = A + B. For n=1, L(1)=4 = 3A + B. Now, we can set up the equations:\n\nA + B = 1\n\n3A + B = 4\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second: 2A = 3 => A = 3/2.\n\nThen, B = 1 - A = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches L(1)=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches L(2)=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which is correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.

Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recursion is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for such recursions. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in this case, a_1 = 4, and a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution would be based on the characteristic equation. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the first few terms and see if a pattern emerges. Let's see: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nAnd then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, same result as before. Alternatively, using the formula for linear recurrence relations: The general solution for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. To find B, we can set a_n = B, then B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our previous calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014iterative computation and using the recurrence formula\u2014lead to the same result.

Let's break it down: 3 * 29,524. 3 * 20,000 = 60,000 3 * 9,000 = 27,000 3 * 500 = 1,500 3 * 24 = 72 Now, adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me verify each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me recast the problem as a recursive computation. Let's define each layer as a function. Let me denote f(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 12 = 13 f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 39 = 40 f(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 120 = 121 f(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 363 = 364 f(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 f(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 f(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 f(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think. The recursive formula here is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, f_p(n) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: f(2)= (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent as well. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(f(9)) where f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or use the closed-form expression, I get the same answer:88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct result. It's a good reminder that for nested expressions like this, working from the inside out is the way to go, and recognizing the pattern can help find a formula to compute it more efficiently rather than manually calculating each layer, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, which would throw off the entire result.

Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280.

Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 3*29524: Let's break it down as 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*24. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Sometimes, nested expressions like this can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9, since there are nine layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n, which might help verify the result without computing each layer step by step. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify this: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as before. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next until we reach the outermost layer. Additionally, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allows us to derive a closed-form solution, confirming the result without manual computation of each layer. The final answer is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series, but it's not exactly the same because each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from the equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. That matches my earlier calculation. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute it directly: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it out: 29,524 * 3: 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572. Correct. So, after verifying each step and using two different methods\u2014step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula\u2014I'm confident that the final result is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be extra sure, let me recompute a couple of the layers quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers check out. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. I think that's solid.

Let me check: 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Yes, correct. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279=3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840.

Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523=29524 (Correct) Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So 60000 +27000=87000 +1500=88500 +72=88572. Hmm, same result. Maybe I didn't make a mistake. But just to be thorough, perhaps I can compute it another way.

So writing it out: 29524 *3: 2 9 5 2 4 *3 = 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I correctly identified the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1 +3, then each layer adds another 1 +3*(previous). So, I think my approach was correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and nonhomogeneous. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, same as before. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. So, I think I did it correctly both by iterative computation and by using the recurrence relation formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, is there a formula for a_n? Let me see. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try that. The homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's assume a particular solution is B. Then, substituting: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, I can compute a_9 directly as (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88,572. Either way, I arrive at the same answer.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let's denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), but I need to check the exact form. Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. We have a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just check if I applied the formula correctly. Since each a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and n goes up to 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Hmm, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, I think I did it correctly. Each layer builds on the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 4, each time it's tripling the previous number and adding 1.\n\nLet me see if there's a pattern here or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Maybe recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar. Let's think about it.\n\nEach layer is defined by a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, starting from a_1 as 1 + 3, which is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me recall the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula to find the value at each layer directly. That might have saved some time, especially if the expression were even longer. But since it's only nine layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad.\n\nBut in this problem, since the expression is given explicitly with nine layers, maybe the step-by-step computation is more straightforward without needing to derive the general formula. However, knowing the formula can be helpful for similar problems with more layers or different coefficients.\n\nSo, in summary, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, I found that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer triples the previous value and adds 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, which gives 29,524, I then multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer, which is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, I'll verify the multiplication again:\n\n29,524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3:\n\n30,000 * 3 = 90,000.\n\nSubtract (30,000 - 29,524) = 476.\n\nSo, 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Same result.\n\nAlright, I feel confident that the answer is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the general formula lead me to the same result. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus three times the previous layer. After computing each layer, we multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a formula or a pattern here that I can use instead of computing each layer manually? Because computing nine layers manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Maybe there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nAnd the final result is 3*L_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard solution method is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Good, so that's consistent.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times the next nested term.

Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each step checks out. I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way. Perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, in our case, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 is 1 + 3*a_1, which is 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can try to find a closed-form solution for this recurrence relation. Let's see.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1.\n\nThe standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for all the layers. So, for n=9, a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, the expression is essentially a geometric series with a ratio of 3, but each term is adjusted by the addition of 1. However, since each term is built upon the previous one, it's more of a recursive geometric progression rather than a simple geometric series.\n\nBut since we've already solved it using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, and both methods agree, I think we're solid.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n3. Compute each layer step by step up to the ninth layer, which gives 29,524.\n4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. \n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4.

Hmm, but let me check my calculations again because 29524 seems a bit high, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's breaking it down digit by digit, which might be more accurate. Let me add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this kind of nested expression, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, for each layer, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} So, substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2 So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let me count: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: 1+3, then layer 2 wraps around that, up to layer 9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, we have 9 layers. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got before. So, then the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, which matches my previous result. Therefore, using the formula, I can confirm that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a geometric series, and the formula I derived is correct. So, this gives me confidence that my answer is correct. I think I've covered all the steps, checked my work, and even found a formula to generalize the solution, which is always a good practice to avoid mistakes in such nested expressions. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula against our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. Since the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 = a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost layer equals 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{another similar expression})\\).

    "text": " 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Actually, 29524 is 29,524. So, 3 * 29,524. Let me compute this properly. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, that's 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Maybe I should go through each layer again to check. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400=29,400 + 120=29,520 +3=29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29,524)=88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to compute this without going through each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or follows some recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can compute it step by step as I did before. Alternatively, maybe I can express a_n in terms of a geometric series. Let's try expanding a few terms to see if a pattern emerges. a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121\nWait a minute, I recognize these numbers: 1, 3, 9, 27, 81... These are powers of 3. So, each a_n seems to be the sum of 1 plus 3 times the sum of the previous powers of 3. Let me check this.\n\nLooking at a_1: 4 = 3^0 + 3^1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2: 13 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3? Wait, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is a_3, not a_2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, a_2 is 13, which is 1 + 3*4 = 13, but 4 is 1 + 3. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 27 = 28? Wait, no, that's not matching. Wait, no, a_3 was 40, which is 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nWait, let me try to express a_n in terms of a geometric series. Since a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 1, we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Substituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I have.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nGood, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince the original problem goes up to Layer 9, which is a_9, let's compute a_9 using the formula.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula, I end up with the same result: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\), and each subsequent layer is \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times a_9 \\):\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nWe also verified using a recurrence relation formula that \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), which confirms that \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Thus, multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nThe computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, the result is 88572. That matches my previous calculation. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem. Sometimes, recognizing a pattern or a formula can help. This expression seems to be a geometric series of some sort, but it's nested, so it's more complicated. Let me see if I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, which might help in computing a_9. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have a_1 = 4, let's check if this formula works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method, we arrive at the same result. This gives me even more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer once more using the formula. a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer from 1 to 9: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f a_3=(81-1)/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f a_4=(243-1)/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f a_5=(729-1)/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f a_6=(2187-1)/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f a_7=(6561-1)/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f a_8=(19683-1)/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f a_9=(59049 -1)/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*a_9=88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, yes, everything checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula up to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*(40) = 120\n\nWait, so in this smaller example, the result is 120, not 39. So where did I go wrong earlier? I think I missed a layer when I was thinking through it. So in the smaller example, it's three layers, so:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*40 = 120.\n\nSo, my initial approach was correct, but when I thought I was getting 39, I must have miscounted the layers. So, going back to the original problem, my approach is correct, and the final answer should indeed be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check another small example to be sure. Let's take two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39\n\nAlternatively, compute it as 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the three-layer example, I had 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(40) = 120, which matches the step-by-step.\n\nSo, in the original problem, we have nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my approach was correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but to make sure, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, so a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but let me think. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and a particular solution would be a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute that again: 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 30000*3 = 90000\n\nSubtract (30000 - 29524) = 476\n\nSo, 90000 - (476*3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after verifying with the closed-form formula and computing step by step, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. \n\n1. Compute each layer:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems pretty big. Let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It was a bit tedious computing each layer, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. Alternatively, recognizing the recurrence relation allowed me to find a formula, which confirmed the result without having to compute each layer manually. That's pretty cool! It shows how recognizing patterns can simplify complex-looking problems.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which simplifies the computation. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Recurrence Relation**: Recognize the pattern as a linear recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, solved to find a formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Final Result**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result would be 88572. But wait, let me check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which we computed as 88572. So, that seems to be the final answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can check the pattern or see if there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. If I have an expression like x = 1 + 3x, then solving for x would give x = (1)/(1 - 3) = -1/2, but that's for an infinite series, which isn't the case here. However, in our problem, the expression is finite, with 9 layers. So, perhaps we can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3, and then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9. Let me check if that's consistent with what I did earlier. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. a_3 =1 + 3*a_2 =1 + 39=40. Yes, that's exactly what I did. So, the sequence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, for n=9, a_9=29524, as computed. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. When n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + B=3A + B. When n=2, a_2=13= A*3^2 + B=9A + B. Now, we can set up the equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2): 6A = 9 => A= 9/6= 3/2. Then, substituting back into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B =4 => 9/2 + B=4 => B=4 -9/2= -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the final expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering how many layers there are, each multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it does add up quickly.

Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 2*3=6. So writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; so 9000+840=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then each next set adds another layer, so the number of layers is 9, right? Because from the innermost to the outermost, each time you have a new 1+3(...). So, yes, 9 layers. So Layer 1 to Layer 9, as I did. So, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try another approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or find a formula for such a nested expression. Let's see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I also arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could compute each layer using the formula, but since I've already verified it step by step and with the general formula, I think it's safe to conclude that the result is correct. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a repeating pattern where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Solving this recurrence relation gives us a closed-form formula, and after computing each layer step by step, we find the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each layer was increasing by a factor, and the numbers got quite large. Let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3.

Hmm, but I feel like the numbers are growing very rapidly, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me check a few layers again.\n\nLayer 1: 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo each layer is correct, and the final multiplication is also correct. So the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric series. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me consider that.\n\nIn general, an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))) can be represented as a continued fraction or a recurrence relation. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I did earlier. So, for n layers, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a_n = c + d*a_{n-1} is a_n = d^{n} * a_0 + c*(d^{n} - 1)/(d - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. So maybe I can model it as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nYes, that's the recurrence. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 \u21d2 B - 3B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2= (27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same answer as before.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the expression is 3 times a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. And 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 =177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So that's another way to get the same result, confirming that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because this is a lot of steps and it's easy to make a mistake. Maybe I should compute each layer again to make sure I didn't skip any or miscalculate. Let's go through each layer one more time: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840.

Now, the final step: 3 * 29524. Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 another way to confirm. Let's break down 29524 into 29000 + 524. So, 29000 * 3 = 87000, 524 * 3 = 1572. Then, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yep, same result. Okay, that seems solid. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check once more because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers or miscalculate a step. Let me recount the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)), right? So, from the innermost Layer 1 to the outermost Layer 9, each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting with Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, multiply by 3: 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe for just 9 terms, computing each step is easier. But just to confirm, let me see if I can model this as a geometric series or something. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has a solution of a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough. It's a good idea to use both iterative computation and the closed-form formula to ensure that the result is accurate, especially with such a nested and repetitive structure. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way. I should compute 3 * 29524 directly. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in calculating one of them. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But wait, let me check Layer 6 again: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it from the inside using another approach. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer follows the pattern of a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it differently. Each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me solve it: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier: For n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After calculating all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's compute the first few terms: a_1=4. a_2=1+3*4=13. a_3=1+3*13=40. a_4=1+3*40=121. a_5=1+3*121=364. a_6=1+3*364=1093. a_7=1+3*1093=3280. a_8=1+3*3280=9841. a_9=1+3*9841=29524. So that's consistent with what I did earlier. Now, the problem is to compute 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is linear, so we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = A*c^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. In this case, c=3 and d=1. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B. To find A and B, we use the initial condition a_1=4. So for n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. Now, let's find another condition. Let's compute a_0. Wait, but in our case, n starts at 1, so maybe we can compute the steady-state solution. Alternatively, we can assume that for large n, a_n approaches a steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = a. So, setting a = 1 + 3a. Solving for a: a = 1 + 3a => 0 = 1 + 2a => a = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, n=9, so a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the expression inside the final 3* is 29524, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So that's another way to get to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the result of the inner layer into the outer one. After computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer's result by 3. The detailed computation confirms that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
