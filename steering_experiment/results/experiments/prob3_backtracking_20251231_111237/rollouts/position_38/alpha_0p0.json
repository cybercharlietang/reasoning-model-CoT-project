    "text": " 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me break that down. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2:1+3*4=13, Layer 3:1+3*13=40, Layer 4:1+3*40=121, Layer 5:1+3*121=364, Layer 6:1+3*364=1093, Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without doing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Now, subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. So, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. Great, so the formula works. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me check: the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, a_9 would be the value of the innermost expression, but wait, no. Wait, in the original expression, the innermost is Layer 1:1+3, then Layer 2:1+3*(Layer 1), etc., up to Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, according to our formula, a_n is the value after n layers. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, which matches the earlier step-by-step computation. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric progression. The formula we derived is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. So, yeah, that seems consistent. Another way to think about it is that each layer is adding another power of 3, but scaled appropriately. So, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with nine 1's. Wait, actually, counting the number of 1's: starting from the innermost, each layer adds a 1, so with nine layers, there are nine 1's. Hmm, but in the formula, we have a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. So, 3^{10} is 3^(number of layers +1). So, that seems to align. Anyway, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinal expression: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations because that's a lot of steps and it's easy to make a mistake. Starting again from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me verify each multiplication step: Layer 2: 3*4 = 12, 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 3*13 = 39, 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 3*40 = 120, 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 3*121 = 363, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364: Let's compute 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093. Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280. Let's compute 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841. Let's compute 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, multiplying 29,524 by 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 *3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000+1,500=88,500; 88,500+60=88,560; 88,560+12=88,572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's it. It was a bit tedious with all the layers, but by computing each one step by step, I managed to get through it without making any mistakes. I guess the key here was to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward, calculating each layer's value before moving on to the next. It's like peeling an onion; each layer reveals the next step until you reach the outermost part, which is then multiplied by 3. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Breaking it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it as such. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence. Let me think. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Then, the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*L_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. This seems more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way. Either by computing each layer step by step or by using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check one more time to be sure. If I compute Layer 9 as (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute 29524*3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 4*3=12 +1=13, write down 3, carryover 1. Finally, 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it all together from the last multiplication: 7, then 3, then 7, then 7, then 1, then 7, then 8, then 5, then 2, then 7. Wait, that seems messy. Maybe I should do it more carefully. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, reading from top: 7, then 3, but wait, actually, when multiplying 29,524 by 3:\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n    2 9 5 2 4\n  x        3\n  -----------\n      8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, let me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer and verifying with the formula, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be sure, let me add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29000 + 29000 = 58000. Then 524 + 524 = 1048. So total is 58000 + 1048 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's break it down: 59000 + 29000 = 88000. 48 + 524 = 572. So total is 88000 + 572 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or miscalculate a step. Let me go back and verify each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo each layer seems to be calculated correctly. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression, to see if I can compute it without manually calculating each layer.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated application of 1 + 3*(previous layer). So each layer is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nWith L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's find A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nAssuming the solution is of the form L_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left-hand side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight-hand side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again: the expression is 3*(L_9), right? So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula for L_n, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways now: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and direct formula. All methods lead to the same result, 88572. So I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the key steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result.\n\n3. Notice the recurrence relation and derive a general formula for each layer.\n\n4. Use the formula to compute the innermost layer directly, then multiply by 3.\n\n5. Verify the result through multiple methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in recognizing patterns and applying recurrence relations to simplify the computation. It also reinforced the importance of double-checking work through different methods to avoid errors.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by repeatedly evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern and applying a recurrence relation, we determine each layer's value step by step. The final computation confirms that the result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply Recurrence Relation:** Recognizing the pattern, we use the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for the nth layer. For n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Final Multiplication:** Multiply the outermost 3 by Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nLooking at the sequence of L_n:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 13\n\nL_3 = 40\n\nL_4 = 121\n\nL_5 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 29524\n\nI can see that each L_n is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression to see if it forms a geometric progression.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27\n\nWait a minute, this seems like powers of 3. Let me check:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2 +1? Wait, no, let me think differently.\n\nWait, 3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nHmm, looking at L_n:\n\nL_1 = 4 = (3^2 + 1)/1? Not exactly. Wait, let me try to express L_n in terms of powers of 3.\n\nLooking at L_1 = 4 = 3 + 1\n\nL_2 = 13 = 9 + 3 + 1\n\nL_3 = 40 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1\n\nWait, that seems to be the case. So, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k + something? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, L_1 = 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1\n\nBut L_2 = 13 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 40 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0\n\nWait, so L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k + something?\n\nWait, for L_1: n=1, sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4, which matches L_1.\n\nSimilarly, L_2: sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which matches L_2.\n\nL_3: sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which matches L_3.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k\n\nBut wait, the sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nIn this case, r=3, so sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nL_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121, correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nL_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 =728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nL_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7:\n\nL_7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8:\n\nL_8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, that's a much more efficient way to compute L_n. So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I can use the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88,572.\n\nThis confirms my earlier result. So, I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the key was recognizing that each layer follows a geometric progression, allowing me to use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to compute each layer directly without having to compute each nested expression step by step. That saved a lot of time, especially since there are nine layers. It's a good reminder of how recognizing patterns can simplify complex-looking problems.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're essentially multiplying the previous total by 3 and adding 1. So, it's a recursive relation, which can be solved using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a geometric series approach, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\). By recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we can compute each layer efficiently using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer \\(L_n\\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nL_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(n = 9\\) (the outermost layer):\n\n\\[\nL_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n\\]\n\nFinally, multiplying by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscompute a step. Let me go through the layers again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then 3*29524=88,572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, that seems consistent. So, I think I did it correctly. Each layer was computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. It's like each step is building on the previous one, which makes sense because each parentheses is nested inside the next. So, the key was to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, computing each layer step by step. It's a bit tedious, but breaking it down made it manageable. I was worried I might have missed a step or miscalculated somewhere, but going through each layer again confirmed that each step was correct. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let's compute that digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward approach. I don't see any immediate formula that applies, especially since each layer depends on the previous one. It might be similar to a geometric series, but with each term being 3 times the previous plus 1. Wait, actually, this does look like a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +72=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did this right. Each layer is built upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like a geometric progression, maybe? Wait, actually, each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Let me test it. If a_1 = 4, then according to the formula, (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, which is not 4. Hmm, maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Let's see. The solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 with a_1=4 is a_n = (4*3^{n} - 1)/ (3 -1) ) = (4*3^{n} -1)/2. Let me test for n=1: (4*3 -1)/2 = (12 -1)/2 = 11/2 = 5.5, which is not 4. Hmm, maybe I'm misapplying the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as we saw earlier. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the innermost layer, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the step-by-step computation is correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly, which might have saved time, but since I was working it out step by step, the manual computation worked too. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is found to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, so it seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be solved using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if that applies here. In this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recursions. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^n * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but in this case, a = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula would be L_n = (b)/(1 - a) + C*a^n. Wait, actually, let me recall the correct formula for such a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p = a*L_p + b. Solving for L_p: L_p - a*L_p = b => L_p*(1 - a) = b => L_p = b/(1 - a). So, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + L_p. Now, applying initial conditions. Let's say L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*a^1 + L_p = 3C + L_p. And we know L_p = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me count again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times? Let me check: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So starting from the first ( after 3, that's layer 1, then each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first (, there are 9 opening parentheses before the innermost 1+3. Wait, no, let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then 1+3*(layer1) is layer2. Then 1+3*(layer2) is layer3. Continuing until the outermost expression, which is layer9, and then multiplied by 3. So, in total, we have 9 layers inside the main 3*(...). So, n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the formula, the final answer is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But let me verify the multiplication step again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake there. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8.

Yep, that's correct. So, I think my final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me check if I correctly identified the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of 1+3(...), there are nine layers.

Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is based on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but since the number of terms is small (nine), it's easier to compute each term step by step as I did earlier. Alternatively, I can represent it as a geometric series. Let me try that approach to verify. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this expression has nine layers. It might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression inside is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That resembles a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 ... a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with the initial layers to ensure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 (correct). For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 (correct). For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 (correct). Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572. I think that's all there is to it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods gave me the same answer, so I feel good about this.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be modeled using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form solution, which confirms the result obtained by step-by-step computation. The final value of the entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the original expression has nine layers, each starting with 1+3(...). But when I counted the layers, I went from Layer1 to Layer9, each time adding another layer. So, the innermost is Layer1, then Layer2 wraps around it, up to Layer9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, when I started, I thought of the innermost as Layer1:1+3=4. Then Layer2:1+3*4=13, etc. So, each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. This expression seems like a geometric series or something similar because each term is multiplied by 3 and added. Let me see: If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 =1+3=4, a_2=1+3a_1, a_3=1+3a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, a_{n} =1 +3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = c*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1) + a_0*r^{n}, but wait, actually, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1). In our case, a_1=4, and the recurrence is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, so c=1, r=3. So, starting from a_1=4, then a_2=1 +3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} -1)/(3 -1). Wait, but a_1 is 4, so when n=1, a_1=4. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. If we set a_0 as the initial term before a_1, then a_1 =1 +3*a_0. But in our case, a_1=4, so 4=1 +3*a_0 => a_0=(4-1)/3=1. So, a_0=1. Therefore, the general formula becomes a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} -1)/2. Plugging a_0=1, we get a_n=3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2 = (2*3^{n} +3^{n} -1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we're computing up to a_9, then a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I found earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again to make sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. Okay, that seems solid. I think I've got it right.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my multiplication. Maybe I made a mistake in the carryover. Let me write it out properly: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8, carryover 0.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: Starting with 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of layers. From the innermost to the outermost, each \"1+3(\" is a layer. Let me count: The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer. Let me see how many layers there are. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first \"(\", after the 3, each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1+3(\n2. Then another ( inside: 1+3(1+3(\n3. Another: 1+3(1+3(1+3(\n4. And so on, until we reach the end.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count how many layers there are. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9, since the outermost expression is 3*(...), which is Layer9, right?\n\nWait, no, because the initial expression is 3*(Layer9), so Layer9 is the innermost? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, if I have n layers, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, let's count the number of layers:\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that after the initial 3, there are 8 opening parentheses before the innermost 1+3. Wait, no, let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences. Let me parse the expression step by step:\n\nStarting with 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first \"(\", after the 3, it's 1+3(...). Then inside that, another 1+3(...), and so on, until the innermost is 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then inside, another 1+3(...\n3. Repeating until the innermost.\n\nEach \"(\" after the initial 3 adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3:\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that after the initial 3, there are 8 \"(\" before the innermost 1+3. Wait, no, let me count:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", after the 3, each subsequent \"(\" adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(1+3(\n3. 1+3(1+3(\n4. 1+3(1+3(\n5. 1+3(1+3(\n6. 1+3(1+3(\n7. 1+3(1+3(\n8. 1+3(1+3(\n9. 1+3(1+3\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers, but I think I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9, with the innermost being 1+3, and each layer wrapping around that. So, in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But I'm not sure if that's correct because when I computed Layer1 to Layer9, I ended up with Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me verify if I counted the layers correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should have stopped at Layer8 and then multiplied by 3, but that might not be the case. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. But I'm not sure if this is correct because when I computed each layer, I ended up with 88572, but I feel like that's a very large number, and I'm not sure if I made an error in the multiplication. Let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. Starting from the first \"1+3(\", each subsequent one adds a new layer. So, let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(1+3(\n3. 1+3(1+3(\n4. 1+3(1+3(\n5. 1+3(1+3(\n6. 1+3(1+3(\n7. 1+3(1+3(\n8. 1+3(1+3(\n9. 1+3(1+3\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers, but actually, the innermost is just 1+3, without another \"1+3(\" after it. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, with the innermost being L_1 = 1+3, then each layer up to L_9. So, that would mean that the outermost expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. But I'm still a bit unsure because 88572 seems quite large. Maybe I should try computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say, for example, compute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). How would that work? Let's compute it step by step.\n\nCompute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))).\n\nFirst, innermost: 1+3=4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\nNext layer: 1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute it directly:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nYes, that works. So, if I have 3 layers, I get 120. Similarly, if I have 4 layers, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(previous)). Let me compute that:\n\nCompute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))).\n\nInnermost: 1+3=4.\n\nNext: 1+3*4=13.\n\nNext: 1+3*13=40.\n\nNext: 1+3*40=121.\n\nOutermost: 3*121=363.\n\nSo, with 4 layers, it's 363. Let me check with my earlier computation. When I had 9 layers, I got 88572. Let me see if the pattern holds. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n, where L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with my earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, that formula works. Therefore, L_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed the smaller case with 4 layers, I got 363, which is 3*L_4=3*121=363. So, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step, layer by layer, to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with Layer1: 1+3=4.\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. After computing up to Layer 9, we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term.

    "text": " 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, I could try to see if there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, each time, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3a_n. Then, we're looking for a_9, and then multiplying by 3. So, the recurrence relation is a_{n+1} = 3a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard methods. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_{n+1} = 3a_n, which is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3K + 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same answer, which reinforces that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is building a geometric series. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression with a ratio of 3. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In this case, though, the series isn't exactly a simple geometric series because each term is dependent on the previous one. But the recurrence relation approach worked well, so maybe that's the way to go. Either way, both methods lead me to the same conclusion. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me verify each layer step by step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524. As I computed earlier, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without having to go through each layer step by step, especially if there are more layers in the future. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. In fact, this is a linear recurrence relation, and it might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for L_n. Let's list out the values we have so far: L1 = 4 L2 = 13 L3 = 40 L4 = 121 L5 = 364 L6 = 1093 L7 = 3280 L8 = 9841 L9 = 29524 Hmm, looking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term minus something? Wait, let's see: L2 = 13, which is 3*L1 + 1? Wait, 3*4=12 +1=13. L3=40, which is 3*L2 +1= 3*13 +1=40. L4=121=3*L3 +1=3*40 +1=121. So, yes, the recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, the outermost layer is L9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, if we denote the entire expression as E, then E=3*L9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2. So, E=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to calculate each layer step by step, which is much more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers. But since in this problem there are only nine layers, step-by-step computation is manageable. But knowing the formula is helpful for understanding the structure of the problem. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1=4. This recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression, which allows us to compute the value of the innermost layer directly and then work our way out. Alternatively, computing each layer step by step is also feasible and serves as a good way to verify the result when the number of layers isn't too large. In either case, the final result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, as both the step-by-step approach and the formula gave me the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is found to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form: 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, we're adding 1 and three times the previous value. This looks like a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each term step by step.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to this recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation of r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for the innermost layer, which is Layer 1, n=1, a_1=4. Then, each subsequent layer increments n by 1. So, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 3*a_9 directly using the formula. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Which again, gives the same result. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different methods all lead to the same result, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. I think I've solved it correctly. The final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting with the innermost layer and computing each subsequent layer, we find the value of each layer up to the ninth.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented recursively as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps, using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and the recursive approach and the formula approach both lead to the same result.

Alternatively, I could have recognized this as a geometric series or used a formula for such nested expressions, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable. But just for practice, let me think if there's a formula that could have been used here. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, using the formula gives the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
