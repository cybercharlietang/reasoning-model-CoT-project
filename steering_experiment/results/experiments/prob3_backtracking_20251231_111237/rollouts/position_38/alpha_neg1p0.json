So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous computations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions, since each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the next layer. Maybe I can find a general formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLet me think about it. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. Then each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be written as:\n\na_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution:\n\na_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nThus, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me check: starting from the innermost as Layer 1, up to Layer 9. So n=1 to n=9.\n\nThus, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 being 29524.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let's see how that would look.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) But since there are 9 layers, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, using the formula we derived earlier, E = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, let's check:\n\nFrom the general solution, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, as above.\n\nThen E = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, E = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Exactly the same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation, or recognizing it as a geometric series\u2014we arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the multiple methods confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. The innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer's value, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 29,524 *3=88,572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88,572. Hmm, but wait a minute, let me double-check the layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the earlier layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in calculation. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 *3. Let me compute this differently to verify. 29,524 *3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me think again because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, especially with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" introduces a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around the previous one. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", each multiplied by 3 except the outermost one, which is multiplied by 3 at the very end. Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, I think my earlier calculation is correct, with Layer 9 being 29,524 and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be expressed using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to represent it as such. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is built using this recursive formula. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, L_3=1+3*13=40, etc., up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. So, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572. I think I've double-checked my work enough times to ensure there are no mistakes. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward and recognizing a pattern, we can compute each layer step by step. Using a recursive formula and a closed-form solution, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this gives 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems too big. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers.

Hmm, that seems correct. But I feel like that's a very large number. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me this result without computing each layer step by step. Because computing each layer up to nine times seems tedious, but maybe there's a recursive formula or a geometric series here. Let's think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation where each term is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis kind of recurrence can be solved using the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. In this case, a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = (L_1 - b/(1 - a)) * a^{n-1} + b/(1 - a).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The standard solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), assuming L_0 is known.\n\nWait, but in our case, L_1 = 4, which is when n=1.\n\nSo, maybe it's better to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, since each term is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can write it as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me just confirm that I didn't make any mistake in the formula. Let me check for n=4: L_4 should be 121.\n\nUsing the formula: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 is indeed 29524, and the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the earlier step-by-step computation. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving each layer step by step and using a recurrence relation formula, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). Starting from the innermost parentheses, we compute each layer outward.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:** Recognizing the recurrence relation, we derive that Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows a pattern, maybe a geometric series or something similar, but given that each term is 1 + 3 times the previous, it's a linear recurrence. However, since the number of layers is manageable (nine layers), computing each step manually is feasible and less error-prone than trying to find a general formula, especially since I might not remember the exact formula for such a recurrence off the top of my head. Alternatively, if I had more layers, I might look for a pattern or a formula to compute it more efficiently, but for nine layers, step-by-step is okay. Another way to think about it is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's do it again: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. That seems consistent. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because each layer is growing exponentially, which makes sense because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series. Let me think if there's a formula for such a nested expression. The general form seems to be something like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. This is a type of recurrence relation. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence where each term a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, starting from a_1=4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer was 1 + 3, which is 4, so a_1=4. Then, a_2=1 + 3*a_1=1 + 12=13, which matches. a_3=1 + 3*a_2=1 + 39=40, correct. So, the general formula for a_k is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_k. The recurrence relation is a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_k - 3*a_{k-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = A*3^k + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4. When k=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with k=1: a_1= (3^{2})/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For k=2: a_2=(3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: a_3=(3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer k, a_k= (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Wait, because (3^{k+1}/2 -1/2)= (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Yes, that's correct. So, for our problem, the innermost layer was a_1=4, and each subsequent layer is a_k= (3^{k+1} -1)/2. But in our problem, we have 9 layers, right? Wait, let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first 3, then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(...)\": Each time I have a new layer. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each next layer wraps around that. So, how many layers? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step out adds another layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2 wraps around Layer 1, Layer 3 wraps around Layer 2, and so on. How many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each ( is a new layer. Let's count them: After the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so that's Layer 1. Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), Layer 2. Continuing, Layer 3, Layer 4, Layer 5, Layer 6, Layer 7, Layer 8, Layer 9. Wait, so actually, the innermost is Layer 9, and each layer wraps around the previous. So, when I computed Layer 1 as the innermost, that was incorrect. Actually, the innermost is Layer 9, and each layer above is Layer 8, Layer 7, etc., up to Layer 1 being the outermost. Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the first ( is Layer 1: 1 + 3*(...). Then inside that, another ( is Layer 2, and so on, until the innermost is Layer 9. So, the innermost is Layer 9: 1 + 3, then Layer 8 wraps around Layer 9, Layer 7 wraps around Layer 8, etc., up to Layer 1, which is the outermost. Therefore, when I computed Layer 1 as 4, that was actually the innermost Layer 9. So, my earlier calculation was actually computing Layer 9 as 29524, but in reality, that's Layer 1. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify. Let me index the layers correctly. Let me define Layer 1 as the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, in my earlier calculation, I computed Layer 1=4, Layer 2=13, Layer 3=40, Layer 4=121, Layer 5=364, Layer 6=1093, Layer 7=3280, Layer 8=9841, Layer 9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*Layer 9=3*29524=88,572. So, that's correct. But to make sure, let's use the formula I derived earlier. The formula is a_k= (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer k=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches my earlier computation. So, Layer 9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute it step by step again, perhaps using the formula for each layer. Since the formula gives a_k= (3^{k+1} -1)/2, so for each layer k=1 to 9, a_k= (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct. Layer 2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Layer 5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. Layer 6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. Layer 7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. Layer 8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. Layer 9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, each layer is correctly computed using the formula. Therefore, the total expression is 3*29524=88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows the formula \\(a_k = \\frac{3^{k+1} - 1}{2}\\).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should write it out:\n\n```\n    29524\n  x    3\n  --------\n```\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2, 9, 5, 2, 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 (tens place) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 (hundreds place) * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 (thousands place) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 (ten thousands place) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo putting it together: 87 (from 2 and 9), then 5, then 8, then 7, then 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me do it step by step:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. So, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write down 7, no carryover.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 (from the ten thousands place), 7 (from the thousands place), 5 (hundreds), 8 (tens), and 2 (units). Wait, that would make 87582? Wait, no, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Wait, maybe I messed up the order.\n\nWait, let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. So, units place is 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place is 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place is 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit (ten thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten thousands place is 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572.\n\nWait, that seems high, but let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add step by step.\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048.\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048.\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548.\n\n88548 + 20 = 88568.\n\n88568 + 4 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(r - 1))*(r^n - 1) + (a_0*r^{n+1})/(r - 1). Wait, no, actually, the homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nWait, let me recall. For a linear recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^n*a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). In this case, a_0 would be the initial term, which is Layer 1: 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer 1 is 4, which is a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer is a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}.\n\nSo, let's set a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524.\n\nUsing the formula for the recurrence relation, a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r = 3, c = 1.\n\nThe general solution is a_n = A*r^n + (c/(r - 1))*(r^n - 1). Wait, no, let me think.\n\nActually, the solution is a_n = (a_0 - c/(r - 1)) * r^n + c/(r - 1).\n\nIn our case, a_1 = 4, so let's adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to express it as a_n = (a_1 - c/(r - 1)) * r^{n - 1} + c/(r - 1).\n\nHere, a_1 = 4, c = 1, r = 3.\n\nSo, a_n = (4 - 1/(3 - 1)) * 3^{n - 1} + 1/(3 - 1).\n\nSimplify: 4 - 1/2 = 7/2. So, a_n = (7/2)*3^{n - 1} + 1/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (7/2)*3^{0} + 1/2 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (7/2)*3^{1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I calculated a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, maybe my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the formula. Let me derive it properly.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's set n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as earlier.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I also arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series, but since the nesting is only 9 layers deep, computing each step wasn't too bad. But using the recurrence relation formula was a good check.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Start from the innermost parentheses and compute each layer step by step.\n2. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n3. Compute up to the 9th layer, which gives 29524.\n4. Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation formula lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 3 * 29524. Let me compute 3 * 29,524. Let me break it down: 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because that seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000+1,500=88,500; 88,500+60=88,560; 88,560+12=88,572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back and verify each step because sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1,093 as 1093, which is the same thing.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again: 3*9,841. 9,841 * 3: 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 29,523 +1=29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29,524: 29,524*3. Let me compute it as 29,524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me try another way: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88,572. Okay, so that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check the layers again, because sometimes when you have multiple layers, a small mistake can propagate and make the final answer wrong.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.

Therefore, the final computation is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my method is correct. For example, let's take a simpler version with fewer layers and see if it matches.\n\nSuppose the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this manually.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThen next layer: 1 +3*4=13.\n\nNext:1 +3*13=40.\n\nThen:3*40=120.\n\nWait, but in this case, the expression would be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))) which is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4))=3*(1 +3*(13))=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120.\n\nIf I compute step by step:\n\nInnermost:1+3=4.\n\nThen:1 +3*4=13.\n\nThen:1 +3*13=40.\n\nThen:3*40=120. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute it as per the original method: Layer1=4, Layer2=13, Layer3=40, then 3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, another test case: 3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))).\n\nCompute innermost:1+3=4.\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121.\n\nThen, 3*121=363.\n\nWait, but according to my method, Layer4 would be 121, then 3*121=363.\n\nBut let me compute the expression as written: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))). So, innermost is 1+3=4.\n\nThen, 1 +3*4=13.\n\nThen, 1 +3*13=40.\n\nThen, 1 +3*40=121.\n\nThen, 3*121=363. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for smaller cases, so it's likely correct for the original problem.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely certain, let me try to see if there's a formula or a pattern here that can help me compute it without manually calculating each layer, in case I made an error in arithmetic.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a geometric series, perhaps.\n\nLet me denote the nth layer as a_n. Then, a_1 = 1 +3 =4.\n\na_2 =1 +3*a1=1 +3*4=13.\n\na_3=1 +3*a2=1 +3*13=40.\n\na_4=1 +3*a3=1 +3*40=121.\n\na_5=1 +3*a4=1 +3*121=364.\n\na_6=1 +3*a5=1 +3*364=1093.\n\na_7=1 +3*a6=1 +3*1093=3280.\n\na_8=1 +3*a7=1 +3*3280=9841.\n\na_9=1 +3*a8=1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nEach a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3.\n\nThen, the particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant C.\n\nSubstitute into the equation: C -3*C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nWait, but wait: when n=1, a1=4.\n\nSo, plug in n=1: a1= A*3^1 + (-1/2)=3A -1/2=4.\n\nSo, 3A=4 +1/2=9/2. Thus, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, n=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the final answer is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step and find that the final result is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then the final computation is 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about this. The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each term is a linear function of the previous one. It looks like a geometric series, but not exactly because each term is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me try to model this. Let's denote the nth term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth term is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me see if I can compute it another way or if there's a pattern I can exploit. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expression by expanding it all the way, but that might be tedious. Let me try that. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me write it out step by step, expanding each layer: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYep, that's consistent. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe will compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually might be faster. But just to confirm, let's see if there's a pattern. Let me list the layers again:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nAnd then 3*Layer 9 = 88572.\n\nWait, another way to approach this might be to recognize that each term is following a geometric progression. Let me see: Let me denote each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved as follows.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nBut since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution B.\n\nSo, substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so for a_n, we have a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut in our case, starting from a_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final step is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, if I had used the formula for a_n, I could have computed a_9 directly as (3^{10}-1)/2, which is 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nSo, either way, the result is the same.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost as Layer 1 up to Layer 9. So, yes, that's correct. So, the computation seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be used to compute this without manually computing each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtracting A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\nB - 3B = 1\n-2B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n3A - 1/2 = 4\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, Layer 1 is 4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.

I don't see any mistakes in the computations or the reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a recurrence relation. Using the recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524.

I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think if that applies here. The expression here is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each term is 1 + 3*previous term, and then multiplied by 3. Hmm, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3. L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2. And so on, up to L9. Then, the total expression is 3*L9. So, in general, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40.

So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, using the recurrence relation method, I also arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct result. I think I've double-checked it thoroughly. So, I'm pretty sure that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, 29524 *3=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Then, a_2=1 + 3*4=13, which matches. a_3=1 + 3*13=40, which is correct. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the numbers are small, maybe computing each step is easier. But just to make sure, let me try to find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of times the expression is nested. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. Each time we have a 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). The original expression has 9 layers of 1+3*(...), so n=9. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Then, 59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation for Layer 9. Therefore, the final value is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using either iterative computation or recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we determine that the 9th layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88,572. Hmm, but wait, let me verify each layer computation again because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer step by step again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, multiplying 29,524 by 3: Let's break it down again to make sure. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, it's 88,572. Wait, but let me check using another method to be absolutely sure. Let's compute 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048. Then add another 29,524: 59,048 + 29,524. Let's add them: 59,048 + 29,524. 8 + 4 = 12, carryover 1. 4 + 2 = 6 +1=7. 0 + 5=5. 9 + 9=18, write down 8, carryover 1. 5 + 2=7 +1=8. So, 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous). So after 9 layers, we get 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Let's denote a_n as the value after n layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Then the total is 3*a_9 = 88,572. So that's consistent with what I did before. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. Let's see, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assuming a_n = C, then C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got before. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So that's another way to get the same result, which confirms the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049, 3^11=177,147. So, (177,147 -3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form expression, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to verify. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but maybe I can compute it step by step as I did before. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a geometric series. Let's see: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nAnd so on.\n\nIf I expand a_n, it would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to index from 0.\n\nLet me try to adjust the indices to start from n=0.\n\nLet me define a_0 as the innermost term, which is 1 + 3 = 4, so a_0 = 4.\n\nThen, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_8, since the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would correspond to a_8 in this 0-indexed system.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 4.\n\nThe solution to this recurrence is:\n\na_n = (a_0 - d/(c - 1)) * c^n + d/(c - 1)\n\nWhere c=3, d=1, and a_0=4.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\na_n = (4 - (1)/(3 - 1)) * 3^n + (1)/(3 - 1)\n= (4 - 1/2) * 3^n + 1/2\n= (7/2) * 3^n + 1/2\n\nSo, a_n = (7/2)*3^n + 1/2\n\nNow, since we're dealing with a_8 (because the innermost is a_0, and we have 9 layers, so the outermost is a_8), let's compute a_8.\n\na_8 = (7/2)*3^8 + 1/2\n\nFirst, compute 3^8:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\nSo, 3^8 = 6561\n\nThen, (7/2)*6561 = (7 * 6561)/2\n\nCompute 7 * 6561:\n\nLet me compute 6561 * 7:\n\n6561 * 7:\n\n1 * 7 = 7\n\n6 * 7 = 42\n\n5 * 7 = 35\n\n6 * 7 = 42\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n6561\n*    7\n------\n45927\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n6561 * 7:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 * 7 = 7\n\n6 * 7 = 42, write down 2, carry over 4.\n\n5 * 7 = 35 + 4 = 39, write down 9, carry over 3.\n\n6 * 7 = 42 + 3 = 45, write down 5, carry over 4.\n\nThere's a carry over of 4 before the 6, so write down 4.\n\nSo, 6561 * 7 = 45927.\n\nSo, (7/2)*6561 = 45927 / 2 = 22963.5\n\nThen, a_8 = 22963.5 + 0.5 = 22964\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got Layer 9 as 29524. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, let's see. If a_8 is 22964, then the outermost expression is 3*a_8, which would be 3*22964 = 68892, which is different from my initial step-by-step calculation of 88572. So, clearly, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the indexing. Let me check again.\n\nIf a_0 is the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen a_1 would be Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_2: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_3: Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_4: Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_5: Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_6: Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_7: Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_8: Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, according to this, a_8 is 29524, which is correct as per my initial step-by-step calculation. But according to the formula, a_n = (7/2)*3^n + 1/2, which for n=8 would be (7/2)*6561 + 1/2 = 22963.5 + 0.5 = 22964, which doesn't match. So, clearly, I've made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula because the initial condition was a_0 = 4, but the general solution I used might have a different starting point. Let me check the general solution again.\n\nThe general solution for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is:\n\na_n = c^n * (a_0 - d/(c - 1)) + d/(c - 1)\n\nIn this case, a_0 = 4, c=3, d=1.\n\nSo,\n\na_n = 3^n * (4 - 1/(3 - 1)) + 1/(3 - 1)\n= 3^n * (4 - 1/2) + 1/2\n= 3^n * (7/2) + 1/2\n\nSo, a_n = (7/2)*3^n + 1/2\n\nNow, for n=8,\n\na_8 = (7/2)*6561 + 1/2\n= (7*6561)/2 + 1/2\n= (45927)/2 + 1/2\n= 22963.5 + 0.5\n= 22964\n\nBut according to my step-by-step computation, a_8 is 29524, so there's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in applying the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is for a different indexing.\n\nWait, let me check n=0: a_0 = 4\n\nUsing the formula:\n\na_0 = (7/2)*3^0 + 1/2 = (7/2)*1 + 1/2 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=1: a_1 = (7/2)*3^1 + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. But according to my step-by-step, a_1 = 13. Hmm, that's not matching. So, the formula is giving me a_1=11, but in reality, a_1 is 13. So, I must have made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula because the standard formula assumes a_0 is the first term, but in my case, a_0 is the innermost term, which is 4, and a_1 is the next layer, which is 13. So, maybe the formula is correct, but I'm miscounting the number of layers.\n\nWait, let's see: The original problem has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, if I consider a_0 as the innermost, then a_8 would be the outermost, which is the 9th layer. But according to the formula, a_8 = 22964, which when multiplied by 3 gives 68892, which is different from my initial calculation of 88572. So, clearly, I'm making a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me derive it again.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_0 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_0 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^0 + (-1/2)\n4 = C*1 - 1/2\nC = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2\n\nWait, that's different from what I had before. I think I made a mistake earlier in the particular solution. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I plug a_n^{(p)} = K into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSo, K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Correct.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nApplying a_0 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 4 = C - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2\n\nSo, a_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this with n=0:\n\na_0 = (9*1 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=1: a_1 = (9*3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (9*9 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (9*27 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (9*81 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (9*243 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (9*729 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (9*2187 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (9*6561 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nAh, okay, so the correct general solution is a_n = (9*3^n -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=8, a_8 = (9*6561 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my step-by-step calculation. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought the formula gave me 22964; I think I used the wrong formula initially.\n\nSo, now, the outermost expression is 3*a_8 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my initial step-by-step calculation.\n\nSo, that's reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula directly without computing each layer step by step.\n\nGiven that a_n = (9*3^n -1)/2, and the outermost layer is a_8, then the entire expression is 3*a_8.\n\nSo,\n\n3*a_8 = 3*(9*3^8 -1)/2\n= 3*(9*6561 -1)/2\n= 3*(59049 -1)/2\n= 3*(59048)/2\n= 3*29524\n= 88572\n\nWhich again gives the same result.\n\nSo, to recap, I computed each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, ensuring that each layer was correctly computed based on the previous one. Then, I attempted to find a general formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation, which allowed me to compute the outermost layer directly and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Both methods led me to the same answer, which gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct solution.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. \n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final result: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait, another way to think about this is that each layer follows the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nSo, we can model this as a linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven that a_1=4, let's find A and B.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=4= A*3^1 + B=3A + B.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, that seems to hold.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the layers correspond correctly. The innermost layer is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to recognize that each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer, which forms a geometric series. But since it's a linear recurrence, the formula I used earlier is appropriate.\n\nI think I've verified it sufficiently. The answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 &= 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 &= 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 &= 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 &= 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 &= 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 &= 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 &= 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. The outermost layer is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13.

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, and there are 9 layers. So, 1+3 is Layer1, then each time wrapping another 1+3*(previous layer). So, yes, 9 layers, ending with Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3. So, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears, each time nested inside. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first, then each time we have another 1+3*(...). Let's count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count how many 1+3 terms there are. Each time you have a new 1+3, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost. So, how many layers are there? Let's see, each opening ( after the first 3 adds a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first ( after 3 is the start of the first innermost layer. Then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3, each ( is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. ( after 3: start of layer 1\n2. Next ( inside: layer 2\n3. Next ( : layer3\n4. Next ( : layer4\n5. Next ( : layer5\n6. Next ( : layer6\n7. Next ( : layer7\n8. Next ( : layer8\n9. Next ( : layer9\n10. Then, the next set is (1+3), which is layer10? Wait, no, because each ( is part of a new layer. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because each 1+3 is a layer. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as there are 9 instances of 1+3, each nested within the previous one. Let me try to write the layers:\n\nLayer1: 1+3\nLayer2: 1+3*(Layer1)\nLayer3: 1+3*(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that would be 9 layers, each time adding another 1+3*(previous layer). So, the innermost is Layer1, then Layer2, up to Layer9, and then multiplied by 3. So, the computation as I did before is correct, leading to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again each step, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check Layer9 again: 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStart from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\n3*3=9.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I was counting the layers, I might have miscounted. Let me check the original expression again to see how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, the expression inside is 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, each time, we have another 1+3 around it. So, how many times does 1+3 appear?\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 is written:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. Finally: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each time adding another 1+3. So, my initial calculation was correct, with 9 layers leading to Layer9=29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nLet me compute the first few terms:\n\na1=4\n\na2=1 +3*4=13\n\na3=1 +3*13=40\n\na4=1 +3*40=121\n\na5=1 +3*121=364\n\na6=1 +3*364=1093\n\na7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, yes, that's the same as before. So, a9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, this recurrence can be solved using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} -1)/(r-1), but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c=1, r=3.\n\nWait, actually, let me check: the standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. So, in this case, r=3, c=1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)}=K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our previous result.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nThis confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked each step, so I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, recognizing a repeating pattern in each layer.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in multiplying or adding. Let me verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as follows: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29,524 *3 is 88,572. Correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote the nth layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 => C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the nth term. That's probably a smarter way than computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since it's only 9 layers, step-by-step isn't too bad. Either way, I end up with the same answer, 88,572. So, I think that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me verify each step again to be sure I didn't make any calculation errors, because it's easy to make a mistake when dealing with multiple layers. Let's go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time and reduce errors. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see. The recursive formula is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The solution to this is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2= (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Great, the formula works. So, using this, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2, then 3*L(9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3*L(9) = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, using the formula, we can compute it more efficiently without having to calculate each layer manually. This method is especially useful if the number of layers is larger, as it would save time and reduce the chance of calculation errors. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable, but having the formula is a good check. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the recursive pattern, we can either compute each layer step by step or derive a closed-form formula to find the value more efficiently. In this case, both methods lead us to the same final answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or something similar, but since each layer is just 1 + 3 times the previous, it's a linear recurrence. However, since the number of layers is small (only nine), computing each step manually is feasible. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me compute one or two layers again. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7.

By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems a bit high, but considering each layer is tripling the previous and adding 1, it's exponential growth. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check the exponent in the formula. The formula was L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n=9, it's 3^{10} -1 over 2. Yes, that's correct. So, that's consistent. So, another way to compute this is by recognizing the pattern and using the formula instead of computing each layer manually. But since I already computed each layer step by step and got the same result, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 29,524 \u00d7 3.

The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard solution method involves finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049; 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the formula derived from the recurrence, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. So, to recap, the expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. By computing each layer step by step, I found that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, I confirmed that the value of the innermost expression is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach cross-verifies the step-by-step computation. So, I'm pretty sure that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term.

    "text": " 3 * 29524. Let me break that down: 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression should be 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Wait, but let me check Layer 8 again: 3*3280. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute that: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did that right. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it step by step helps prevent mistakes. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression after 9 layers is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer manually, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, both methods work. It's interesting to see how the recurrence relation can be solved to find a direct formula, saving time in the future. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next nested term)}\\).

    "text": " 3 * 29524. Let me compute that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; and then the next digit is 0, so 0*3=0. Wait, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: Let me compute each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check my multiplication again: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. When I was computing each layer, I started with Layer 1 as 1 + 3 = 4, then Layer 2 as 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. But the original expression is 3 times the entire expression starting with 1 + 3(...). So, does that mean that after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3 * 29524, which is 88572? That seems correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, another way to look at it is that the entire expression simplifies to (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me verify that:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer adds another exponent of 3. So, the total number of multiplications by 3 is 9, but since we start with 3*(1 + 3*(...)), the total exponents would be 10, leading to 3^{10} in the formula. Then, the formula becomes (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me see:\n\nIf I have n layers, then the expression would be (3^{n+1} -3)/2. So, in this case, n=9, so (3^{10} -3)/2? Wait, no, because when I computed L_9, it was (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives (3^{11} -3)/2. So, yes, for n layers, the expression is (3^{n+2} -3)/2? Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, in our case, n=9 layers, starting from L_1 up to L_9, and the total expression is 3*L_9. Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. So, yes, for 9 layers, it's (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nTherefore, 3^{11} is 177147, subtract 3 gives 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer.\n\nBut since I'm just starting out, I think computing each layer step by step is clearer, even if it's a bit more time-consuming. It helps prevent mistakes and ensures that each step is understood.\n\nSo, to recap, starting from the innermost parentheses, I computed each layer by substituting the previous layer's result into the next one. Each layer was of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to Layer 9, I had the value 29524, which I then multiplied by 3 to get the final answer of 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked my work enough times, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula lead me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). \n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4.

Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might make a mistake. Let me verify each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I can notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me think: Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, starting from Layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a2 = 1 + 3a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a3 = 1 + 3a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, an = 1 + 3an-1, with a1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for an. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving an - 3an-1 = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is an = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is an = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the known values: For n=1: (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a1=4. For n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13, which matches a2=13. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40, which matches a3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Wait, because n=9, so an = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, a9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, which also gave me the same result. So, either way, I arrive at the same answer. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Wait, that's 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach would work. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. So, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Comparing both sides, we have B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few terms: For n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, and we have 9 layers in total. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). Let me compute a_9 first using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using a different method. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and thus for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's another way to see it. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer now. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation can simplify the computation instead of calculating each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, even computing each step wasn't too bad, although it was a bit time-consuming. So, in summary, the problem involved recognizing the nested structure, computing each layer from the inside out, and then applying the final multiplication by 3. Alternatively, by modeling the problem with a recurrence relation, I could find a closed-form solution, which also led me to the same answer. Both methods are valid, and it's reassuring to see that they agree with each other. So, I think I'm done here. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, but let me consider another approach just to verify. Maybe this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a repeated multiplication by 3. Each time, it's 1 + 3*something, which is similar to a recurrence relation. Let's model this as a recurrence. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recurrence. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, which matches what I had before. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, this is indeed a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to compute a_9 more efficiently. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 29524*3: Let me compute 29524*3 again. 29,524 *3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding up: 60,000+27,000=87,000; 87,000+1,500=88,500; 88,500+60=88,560; 88,560+12=88,572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer.

Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without going through each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth term is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, we get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth term, which simplifies the computation. Applying this formula, we find the value of the innermost expression and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

Hmm, that seems pretty large, but given the number of layers, each multiplying by 3 each time, it makes sense that the number grows exponentially.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Assuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Let's substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) = A*3^n, and 3*B = 3B. So, right side is A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let me confirm how many layers there are. The original expression is 3*(...), and inside, each layer adds another 3*(...). Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I think there are 9 layers. Let me check: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each set of parentheses adds another layer. Let's count them: Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: (1+3). Then Layer 2: (1+3*(Layer1)). Layer3: (1+3*(Layer2)), and so on until Layer9. So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents or the arithmetic. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2 =243^2=59049. So, a_9 is (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about this problem, perhaps using geometric series or something else, but given that each layer is defined by a recurrence relation, the approach I took seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524*3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 =7, write down 7.\n5 *3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 *3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n0 *3=0, write down 0.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 0, 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to verify. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous plus particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.

Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my previous calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which makes me confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's see. The recursive formula is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Let me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous part is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^(n-1). The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say Ln = A. Substituting into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = C*3^(n-1) - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^(1-1) - 1/2 => 4 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, the solution is Ln = (9/2)*3^(n-1) - 1/2. Let me simplify this: Ln = (9/2)*3^(n-1) - 1/2 = (9*3^(n-1))/2 - 1/2 = (9*3^(n-1) - 1)/2. Alternatively, since 9 = 3^2, we can write it as (3^2 * 3^(n-1) - 1)/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that: 3^2 * 3^(n-1) = 3^(2 + n -1) = 3^(n +1). So yes, that works. Therefore, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I've already computed to see if it holds. For Layer 1: n=1, L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: n=2, L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: n=3, L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: n=4, L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: n=5, L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: n=6, L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: n=7, L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: n=8, L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: n=9, L9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works! So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula to find Layer 9 directly. So, L9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier result. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. The original expression is 3*(L9), where L9 = (3^10 -1)/2. So, the entire expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation. But I think computing each layer step by step is manageable since there are only nine layers, and it's a good way to ensure accuracy, especially if I'm not sure about the formula. Either way, I arrive at the same answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is 88572.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3\" is a layer, so how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each next layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Let's parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3(...). Let's count how many times this happens:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...3(1 + 3(...\n3. ...3(1 + 3(...\n4. ...3(1 + 3(...\n5. ...3(1 + 3(...\n6. ...3(1 + 3(...\n7. ...3(1 + 3(...\n8. ...3(1 + 3(...\n9. ...3(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", each nested inside the previous one. Therefore, my computation of 9 layers is correct, ending at Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. Similarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. To solve this, I can try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p. Solving for L_p: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => 0 = 1 + 2*L_p => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 *3. Let's do it another way: 29524 *3: 29000*3=87000, 524*3=1572. So, 87000 +1572=88572. Correct. So, the final answer is 88572.
