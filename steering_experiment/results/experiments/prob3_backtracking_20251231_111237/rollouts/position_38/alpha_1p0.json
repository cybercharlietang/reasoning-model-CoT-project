    "text": " 29524 * 3. I can do this step by step: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but given the repeated multiplications by 3, it might be correct. Let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, okay, that seems consistent. But wait, I just realized that the original expression has nine layers, but when I started counting from Layer 1 as the innermost, I might have miscounted. Let me check how many layers there are. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each step out adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers before the outermost 3. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me parse the expression again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3(...). Each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count:\n\n1. 1 + 3(...)\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n4. 1 + 3(...)\n5. 1 + 3(...)\n6. 1 + 3(...)\n7. 1 + 3(...)\n8. 1 + 3(...)\n9. 1 + 3(...)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Therefore, my earlier calculation of Layer 9 being 29524 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can write out the terms or find a closed-form formula. Let's see:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Now, the general solution for such a recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the innermost expression a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. But in this case, since it's a finite number of layers (9), the closed-form formula is more straightforward.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in multiplying 29524 by 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step follows logically, and the closed-form formula confirms the result from the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer and applying the recurrence relation, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next nested term).\n2. **Start from the innermost layer**: Begin with the innermost parentheses and work outward.\n3. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4. **Multiply the outermost factor**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 times 20,000 is 60,000. 3 times 9,000 is 27,000. 3 times 500 is 1,500. 3 times 24 is 72. So adding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I do multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate one of the steps. Let me go back through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from the innermost layer). This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, and the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the result I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series, but I think the recursive approach worked well here.

    "text": " 29524 multiplied by 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that can't be right because when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check my calculations again because 3*29524 should be 88572, but let me verify each step because I might have messed up earlier layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (That's correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct). Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000; 9000*3=27000; 500*3=1500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now add them step by step: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when I do these nested computations, I might have missed a layer. Let me count the layers again to make sure I didn't stop too early or too late. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let's count how many times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me write it out: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\" before the final closing parentheses. So that would mean 9 layers, right? So when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation would be r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but since each term depends on the previous one, the recurrence relation approach seems appropriate here. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. I started by computing each layer step by step, which took me through layers 1 to 9, each time substituting the value from the previous layer. Then, I used the recurrence relation method to derive a formula for a_n, which allowed me to compute a_9 directly without having to compute all the intermediate layers. Both methods led me to the same result, which is 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrences. The recurrence is of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c and d are constants. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*c^n + (d/(c - 1)), where A is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nSo, applying this formula, we have:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (1)/(3 - 1) = A*3^n + 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + 1/2\n\n4 = 3A + 1/2\n\nSubtract 1/2 from both sides:\n\n4 - 1/2 = 3A => 3.5 = 3A => A = 3.5 / 3 = 7/6.\n\nSo, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2\n\nSimplify this:\n\na_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2\n\nWe can write 3^n as 3*3^{n-1}, but maybe it's better to compute it as is.\n\nWait, but let me check if this formula works with the initial terms.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (7/6)*3^1 + 1/2 = (7/6)*3 + 1/2 = (7/2) + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (7/6)*3^2 + 1/2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 1/2 = 10.5 + 0.5 = 11. Wait, but earlier we had a_2 =13. Hmm, that's a problem. So, the formula gives 11, but the actual value is 13. That means I must have made a mistake in deriving the formula. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, the general solution for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = A*c^n + d/(c - 1). Wait, is that correct? Let me verify.\n\nYes, for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is indeed a_n = A*c^n + d/(c - 1), where A is determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, but in our case, the initial condition is a_1 = 4, and c=3, d=1. So, let's plug in n=1:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + 1/(3 - 1) = 3A + 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2\n\nThus, A = (7/2)/3 = 7/6.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2.\n\nBut when n=2, a_2 should be 13, but according to the formula:\n\na_2 = (7/6)*3^2 + 1/2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 1/2 = 10.5 + 0.5 = 11, which is not equal to 13. So, something is wrong here. That means my general formula is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, starting from n=0. Let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, that might be the correct formula. Let me check.\n\nYes, the standard solution for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is:\n\na_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1)\n\nWhere a_0 is the initial term.\n\nIn our problem, the initial term is a_1 = 4. So, perhaps I need to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nWait, if we take a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\na_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1)\n\nBut in our case, a_1 is given, so maybe we should consider a_0 as the term before a_1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the recurrence starting from a_0.\n\nLet me redefine the problem. Let\u2019s say that a_0 =1, and a_1 =1 +3*a_0 =1 +3*1=4, which matches our original a_1=4. Then, the general formula would be:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_0=1.\n\nThen, using the standard formula:\n\na_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1)\n\nHere, c=3, d=1, a_0=1.\n\nSo, a_n = 3^{n} *1 + 1*(3^{n} -1)/(3 -1) =3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (2*3^{n} +3^{n} -1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=0: a_0=(3^{1} -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this works! So, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. But in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with 9 sets of parentheses. Each set corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 +3, that's a_1=4. Then, each layer adds another 1 +3*(previous). So, the outermost layer would be a_9.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, that's a more efficient way to compute it using the formula instead of computing each layer manually. But since I was able to derive the formula, that's a good learning point.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer up to a_9, which I did earlier, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to confirm:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. Both methods, the step-by-step layer computation and the formula using the geometric series, lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost Layer):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me compute this more carefully.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe there's a geometric series or a recurrence relation here. Let me think about that.\n\nLet's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n \u2265 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 \u21d2 -2*L_p = 1 \u21d2 L_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works perfectly. So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I can use this formula to find L_n directly.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier result. I think this is correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3^{10} and see:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, 3^10 is indeed 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nMultiplying by 3: 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer and \\( L_9 \\) is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\n1.

Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, then L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, each layer is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => Subtract 3A from both sides: -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f For n=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f For n=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f For n=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f For n=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f For n=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer, L9, is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution was a smarter way, especially if the number of layers were larger. It saved me from computing each layer manually. But since there are only nine layers, both methods worked. I think I understand the problem now. The key was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or finding a formula for the nth layer. In this case, the formula approach was more efficient. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln. The recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1 +1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Lp = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute directly to L9 without computing each layer manually, which would have saved time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad, although it's easy to make a multiplication error somewhere. It's reassuring that both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe it's correct after all. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula or a pattern that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could help verify the result. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3. Then each subsequent term a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Wait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(a_9), right?

Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try expanding it step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost expression as E1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*(E1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*(E2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*(E3) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*(E4) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*(E5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*(E6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*(E7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*(E8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(E9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation formula, or think of it as a geometric series, I end up with the same result. That makes me feel more confident that 88,572 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times and through different methods, so I'm pretty sure that's the right solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward and using a recurrence relation, we find the result to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again to verify. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or recognize a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to a certain number of terms. Wait, actually, if I expand each layer, maybe I can find a formula. Let me try expanding a few layers to see if a pattern emerges. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2? Wait, 3^2 is 9, minus 1 is 8, divided by 2 is 4. Hmm, that's correct for Layer 1. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Let's see if that fits a formula. If Layer 1 is 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2, then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let me see if there's a formula for Layer n. Maybe it's (3^(n+1) - 1)/2? Let me test that. For Layer 1: n=1, (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For Layer 2: n=2, (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, it seems that each Layer k is equal to (3^(k+1) -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29,524=88,572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^10 -1)/2 ). But regardless, the step-by-step approach worked, and I verified it using the formula as well. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1 repeatedly, it's plausible. Let me just verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So writing it down: 29524 * 3 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, my final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see: The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the next is 1 + 3(...), and inside that, another 1 + 3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of 3(...) sections. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(...)\n3. Continuing, each time it's 3(1+3(...))\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3(...). Let's count how many times 1 + 3(...) occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, so actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(layer n-1). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times you can go from the innermost to the outermost, which is 9 layers because each opening parenthesis is closed, and there are 9 sets of 1 + 3(...).\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had 9 layers, starting from 1 + 3 up to layer 9, and then multiplied by 3. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, let's count the opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have (1 + 3(...)) which is the first opening parenthesis.\n2. Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)) which is the second.\n3. Continuing this way, each time we have another opening parenthesis.\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses are there? Let's count:\n\n- The first is after the initial 3: 3(\n- Then, each subsequent layer adds another ( before 1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, from the initial 3, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with 9 layers.\n\nWait, let me see: The expression is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then, inside that, 1+3(, so another (\n3. Inside that, another (, and so on until the ninth (.\n\nWait, actually, the number of ( is 9. So, the innermost is the ninth (, which is (1+3). So, each layer is one more ( until the ninth. So, that would mean that the innermost is layer 9, but when I computed earlier, I started with layer 1 as the innermost. So, perhaps I have to adjust my counting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to write the expression with each layer:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, that's correct. So, starting from L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, L4 = 121, L5 = 364, L6 = 1093, L7 = 3280, L8 = 9841, L9 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Let me think about it. This expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))), with n layers. In this case, n=9.\n\nI recall that such expressions can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nFor n > 1, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nTo find A and B, we can plug in the initial condition and find a pattern.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4.\n\nNow, let's compute a few terms using the recurrence to see if we can find a pattern.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier.\n\nNow, let's try to find the closed-form formula.\n\nWe have the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard method to solve this is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5:\n\na_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6:\n\na_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7:\n\na_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8:\n\na_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as computed earlier.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my initial step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula directly, I could plug n=9 into the expression for a_n and then multiply by 3.\n\nBut in this case, since the problem is to compute the expression step by step, my initial approach suffices.\n\nI don't see any errors in my reasoning, and the formula confirms the result. Therefore, I think the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting with the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated and used in the next layer until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. Using a step-by-step approach and verifying with a recurrence relation, the final result is computed.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, no, because 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so after the 2, there are no more digits. Wait, so the last digit is 2 (ten thousands place). So, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Let me see if there's a pattern or formula I can use. Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution as a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 3*(previous) +1. But in this case, since we're starting from 1 + 3*(...), it's similar but slightly different. Wait, actually, it's the same as the recurrence relation we just solved. So, yeah, the formula still applies. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer until the ninth layer is reached, which results in 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers.\n\nWait, actually, I think I miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, we have 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and another parenthesis. So starting from the innermost, each layer is one more 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, which was 29,524, and then multiplied by 3, getting 88,572, that seems correct, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me start over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3 +1 = 7, write down 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3 +1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3 +2 = 8, write down 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original problem has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3(...). So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, that's correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in Layer 7 or Layer 8.\n\nWait, Layer 6 was 1093. So Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. That's correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3.\n\n9000*3=27,000\n\n800*3=2,400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120=29,520 +3=29,523.\n\nSo, 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524=88,572. Let me confirm this multiplication:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a very large number. Let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... nine times ... ))).\n\nYes, that's correct. Each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after nine layers, we get 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to see if I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer n is defined as:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1)\n\nWith Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for Layer n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as before.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. The formula gives a_n for each layer, and since the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula.\n\nLet me see: The expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. Correct.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the exponentiation.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)=177144.\n\nDivided by 2: 177144/2=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a closed-form solution to efficiently compute the value of the outermost layer, leading to the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term).

Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me verify each multiplication step because that's where errors often happen. Layer 2: 3*4 = 12, plus 1 is 13. Correct. Layer 3: 3*13 = 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 4: 3*40 = 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. Layer 5: 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Wait, earlier I said 3*364=1092, so 1092+1=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093. Let me compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. This expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=1+3=4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the 9th term, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, using both methods, step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct result. I think I've solved it correctly. Just to recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By working from the inside out, I computed each layer step by step, verified each multiplication, and then used a formula for the recurrence relation to confirm the result. Both approaches led me to the same final answer, so I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have messed up the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are because I only labeled up to Layer 9, but when I started, the innermost was Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me check the original expression again to make sure I have the correct number of layers.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer.

Let me count how many times that happens.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside that, there's 1 + 3(...), which is the first inner layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of layers.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, from the inside out:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3), which is Layer 1.\n\n2. Then moving out, it's (1+3(Layer1)), which is Layer 2.\n\n3. Then (1+3(Layer2)), Layer3.\n\n4. (1+3(Layer3)), Layer4.\n\n5. (1+3(Layer4)), Layer5.\n\n6. (1+3(Layer5)), Layer6.\n\n7.

Then, the outermost is 3*(Layer9), which is the entire expression.\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscount.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Maybe the number of layers is 8 because each time we add a layer, we go from inside to outside. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3(...), which is the first inner layer. Then each time we have another 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does \"1 + 3(...)\" occur?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time we have a \"1+3(\", which is 9 times. Because from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, total layers inside the initial 3(...) would be 9, right? Because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer1 as 1+3=4, then Layer2 as 1+3*4=13, Layer3 as 1+3*13=40, and so on up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me try to compute each layer step by step again, carefully, to make sure.\n\nLet me write each layer step by step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check Layer9 again. Is that correct? Let me compute 3*9841 again.\n\n9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute it again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...), and the innermost part is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, perhaps I should check whether there are 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...), which would make the total layers 9, leading to Layer9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1+3(1+3))\n3. Then, (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n... and so on until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the innermost is (1+3(1+3(...))), so perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the expression properly.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time I see \"1+3(\", it's a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. Then, (1+3(1+3))\n3. Then, (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n... and so on until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the innermost is 1+3(...), and each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.

So, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost, Layer1 is 1+3, then Layer2 is 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9, which is 1+3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that's 9 layers inside, making the total layers 9, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I look at the original expression, it's 3(...) with 9 layers inside. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, 9 layers inside, leading to 29524, then times 3 is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this problem using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear, so we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nIn this case, k = 3, and c = 1.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it's correct.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The problem is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 layers of 1+3*(...). So, each layer corresponds to a_n where n goes from 1 to 9, and then multiplied by 3. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression using the formula without computing each layer step by step. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147\n\nThus, the entire expression is (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572\n\nWhich is the same result as before.\n\nSo, that confirms that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations with exponents. 3^10 is 59049, correct. 3^11 is 59049*3=177147, yes. Then, 177147-3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the entire expression by expanding each layer, but that would be time-consuming. Since the formula approach worked and the step-by-step computation also worked, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nThe problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWe recognize that each layer follows the recurrence a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nWe derived a closed-form solution a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nFor n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer follows the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula:\n   a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n3. **Compute the 9th Layer**: For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2. And so on, up to L9. This seems like a recurrence relation. In general, each term is defined as L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution can be found using the method for solving linear recurrences. The general solution is L_n = C*a^{n} + d, where d is a constant particular solution. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression using the formula. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(L9), where L9=(3^{10}-1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=59049*3=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's another way to look at it, using the formula. So, that confirms the answer again. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach gave me the same result. So, I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check my calculations, especially the layers, because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that seems right. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value at each layer, starting from n=1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. The solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in this case, our recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c=3 and d=1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. Let me adjust the indices properly. If we let a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. So, the general solution is a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Since a_0 = 1, this becomes a_n = 3^n + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Simplifying, a_n = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1, and the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, this method also confirms the answer. It's reassuring to see that both methods give the same result.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error somewhere. Let me go back step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let me compute that. 9000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. Adding those: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29,524). So, 29,524 * 3. Let me do that again: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, yes, 3 * 29,524 is indeed 88,572. Hmm, but wait, that seems quite large. Maybe I should check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, there are nine layers, each with 1+3(...). So, Layer 1: 1+3( ) Layer 2: 1+3(1+3( )) and so on, up to Layer 9. So, I think I correctly computed up to Layer 9. Therefore, 3*(Layer 9) = 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, each layer follows L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants. Let's find C. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L_9=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. Yep, that all checks out. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence formula confirms the result. So, I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 directly:\n29,524\n*        3\n--------\n 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the total is 88,572.\n\nBut hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscount. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So I computed Layer 1 through Layer 9 correctly, each time plugging the result into the next layer. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression resembles a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n... and so on.\n\nI can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence to find a formula for a_n, which would allow me to compute a_9 without calculating each layer step by step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n=> C - 3*C = 1\n=> -2*C = 1\n=> C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3*A - 1/2\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*A\n4.5 = 3*A\nA = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5\n\nSo, A = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If A = 3/2, then:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that looks correct.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\n1. I recognized the nested structure and decided to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n2. I computed each layer step by step, which worked but was time-consuming.\n3. Then, I noticed the recurrence relation and derived a formula for a_n.\n4. Using the formula, I computed a_9 and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n5. Both methods gave the same answer, so I'm confident it's correct.\n\nI don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find the value of each layer and ultimately compute the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I've got the correct answer here. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer worked well. Each time, I just had to compute the innermost expression first and then work my way outwards, multiplying by 3 each time and adding 1. It's interesting how these nested expressions can get so large quickly because of the multiplication by 3 each time. I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have given me the result without computing each layer step by step. Maybe something related to geometric series or recursion? Let me think. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. That seems like a recursive sequence. Maybe I can model this with a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of Layer n. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. I can solve this recurrence to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A and C are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + C = 3A + C. But since the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me assume the particular solution is a constant C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the Layer 9 value is indeed 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that. Let's consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, the final result is 88,572. That matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. I think this is the correct approach, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression, which avoids having to compute each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step was manageable. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, and then using the formula for the sum of a geometric series might have been another approach, but I think the recurrence method was more straightforward here. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, I arrived at the final result of 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same answer.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 (correct) Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition. Wait, but in this case, a = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula might be slightly different. Let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrences of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. The solution is L_n = a^{n} * (L_0 + (b)/(1 - a)) - (b)/(1 - a). Wait, maybe I should look for a particular solution and a homogeneous solution. Alternatively, I can use iteration to find a closed-form expression. Let's try that. Starting with L_1 = 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, I can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, perhaps I can write L_n = 3^{n} + (something). Let me see if that works. Let's test for n=1: L_1 = 4. If I write L_1 = 3^1 + c, then 3 + c = 4 \u21d2 c=1. So, L_1 = 3 +1=4. For n=2: L_2 = 3^2 + c = 9 + c. But L_2 is 13, so 9 + c =13 \u21d2 c=4. Hmm, that doesn't match the previous c=1. So that approach might not work directly. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is of the form L_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Let me test that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but L_1 is 4. So that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe another approach. Let me consider the recurrence relation L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), I can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 \u21d2 A - 3A =1 \u21d2 -2A=1 \u21d2 A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C -1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. Perfect! So, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, L_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29,524=88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that makes sense. To make sure, let me compute 3^10 just to confirm: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. Yes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed (59,049 -1)/2=29,524. Multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. I think that's solid. So, the step-by-step solution is as follows: Starting from the innermost parentheses, compute each layer by substituting the value of the previous layer into the next one. Each layer follows the pattern L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1=4. After computing up to Layer 9, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that.

Let me try a different approach. Each time I have a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) (Layer 3)\n...\nContinuing until Layer 9.\n\nWait, but the original expression ends with (1+3), so let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" after the initial 3 adds a layer. Let's count them:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is the start of Layer 1.\n- Then, inside that, another ( starts Layer 2.\n- And so on, until the innermost (1+3), which would be Layer 9.\n\nSo, in total, there are 9 layers, each adding a new 1 + 3*(...). So, my initial computation of 9 layers is correct, and I calculated up to Layer 9 as 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I actually computed 9 layers. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, so the final result is 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms that the result is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute a few layers using the formula to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor example, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...\" is a layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many layers are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is wrapped by another. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\" before the innermost \"1+3\". Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of layers. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the string: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of \"1+3(\" before the innermost (1+3). Wait, no, actually, each time you go out a layer, you have another \"1+3(\", so starting from the innermost, which is layer 1, and moving outwards, how many layers do we have?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each time we have a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then, moving out, each time we have another \"1 + 3(...)\", so layer 2, layer 3, etc., until we reach the outermost layer, which would be layer 9. Because the expression has 9 nested layers. So, yes, I think I did compute up to layer 9 correctly, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that's the final answer. But just to make sure, let me try to compute it again, perhaps using a different approach, maybe looking for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to error.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, found a formula, and even computed it using the formula, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n1.

Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400. 29,400 + 120 = 29,520. 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute it again to be sure. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, yes, 29,524 * 3 is indeed 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence. Let me write down the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's nine layers, which matches the original problem. Now, the total expression is 3*a_9, which we found to be 88,572. But perhaps there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D Now, equate both sides: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D Subtract C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, yes, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that it's correct. I think I'm done then.

Let me check that again: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000, 9,000 * 3 = 27,000, 500 * 3 = 1,500, 24 * 3 = 72. Adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern of a recurrence relation. Let's denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent layer a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Specifically, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n = 3^n - 1. Wait, is that right? Let me test it with the layers we've computed. For n=1: a_1 = 3^1 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2. Hmm, but we have a_1 = 4. That doesn't match. Maybe my assumption is wrong. Let's try to find the general formula for a_n. Starting with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Let's see if there's a pattern here. Maybe a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 * 2 + something? Wait, let me think differently. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P - 3*P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, yes. So the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88,572. I think I've got it right. It was a bit tedious computing each layer, but using the recurrence relation and the general formula helped confirm that each step was correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula up to the 9th layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, yes, 9 layers in total. So, the last computation is Layer 9, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, in case I made an error in one of the steps. Let me think about it. The expression is a nested multiplication where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost, then: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 ... and so on. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that my earlier step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the closed-form formula backed up the step-by-step calculation. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding up: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding: 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3: 3*29524.

So, yes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, but wait, I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but in my calculation, I considered Layer 9 as the outermost parentheses, which is correct because each subsequent layer is nested inside the previous one. So starting from the innermost, I correctly worked my way out, and then multiplied the outermost result by 3. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. If I have an expression like x = 1 + 3x, then solving for x would give x = (1)/(1 - 3) = -1/2, but that's for an infinite series, and our case is finite. Since we have nine layers, maybe there's a way to represent it using a geometric progression.\n\nThe general formula for a finite nested expression like this is x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but in our case, x_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, x_2 = 1 + 3x_1, and so on up to x_9. So, each x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, starting from x_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is x_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is x_n = 3x_{n-1} + 1, with x_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is x_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution x_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is x_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition x_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: x_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, x_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I also arrived at the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer follows the pattern x_n = 3x_{n-1} + 1, and solving it using the method for linear recurrences, I found that x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Plugging in n=9 gives x_9=29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nThis seems solid. Both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make absolutely sure, perhaps I can compute one more layer manually to check.\n\nLet me take Layer 7: 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident now that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result into the next layer's expression.\n3. Continue this process until reaching the outermost layer.\n4. Multiply the final result by 3 as per the original expression.\n\nUsing this method, each layer is computed step by step, leading to the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure if I did that correctly.

    "text": " 3 * 29524. Well, 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. I think I did it correctly. But just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which reminds me of a geometric series or maybe a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can write a recursive formula: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We also need another condition, but since the recurrence is first-order, we can solve for A and B using the homogeneous and particular solutions. Alternatively, we can compute a few terms and see if a pattern emerges. Let's compute a_1 through a_9 again using the recursive formula to see if there's a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Hmm, the numbers are growing exponentially, which makes sense because each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can express a_n in terms of powers of 3. Let's try to find a pattern: a_1 = 4 = 3 + 1\na_2 = 13 = 9 + 4\na_3 = 40 = 27 + 13\na_4 = 121 = 81 + 40\na_5 = 364 = 243 + 121\na_6 = 1093 = 729 + 364\na_7 = 3280 = 2187 + 1093\na_8 = 9841 = 6561 + 3280\na_9 = 29524 = 19683 + 9841\n\nWait a minute, I see that each a_n is equal to 3^n + a_{n-1}, but actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so maybe that's a different way to express it. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, especially since both methods gave me the same result. It's always reassuring to cross-verify using a different approach.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence relation is given by L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, let me make sure I remember the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is indeed L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. In our case, L_1 = 4, which is the innermost layer. Wait, no, actually, in our case, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. So, if we consider L_1 = 4, then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, perhaps the general formula would be L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me test that. For n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but Layer 1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the formula. Alternatively, perhaps L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test that. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, which matches Layer 3. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121, which matches Layer 4. Great, so the formula seems to be L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n starts at 1 for the innermost layer. Therefore, Layer 1: n=1, L_1= (3^2 -1)/2=4 Layer 2: n=2, L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=13 Layer 3: n=3, L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=40 And so on, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 /2 = 29,524. That matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29,524 = 88,572, which is what I calculated before. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step. That's much faster and reduces the chance of error. So, the final answer is 88,572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59,049 -1 =59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Multiply by 3: 29,524*3=88,572. Yep, that seems right.
