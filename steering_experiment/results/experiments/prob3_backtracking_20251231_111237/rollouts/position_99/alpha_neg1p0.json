    "text": " Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1: a_1=4, and the outermost layer is layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute a_9: 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our previous computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, I arrive at the same result. I think that's thorough enough.

So we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from a_1) 9A + B = 13 (from a_2) Subtracting the first equation from the second: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which also matches. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B, right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches.

Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which is what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.

Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the equation: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let me see: The innermost layer is layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches our earlier computation. Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, that's consistent with our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, the equation becomes: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Then, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

    "text": " Plugging in the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's find a general expression for a_n. Since each a_n is built by multiplying the previous term by 3 and adding 1, the solution can be written as a_n = (a_1 - 1/2)*3^{n} + 1/2. Wait, let me verify that. The standard solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 - c/(k-1)))*k^{n-1} + c/(k-1). In this case, k=3, c=1. So, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 - 1/(3-1)))*3^{n-1} + 1/(3-1) = (a_1 - 1/2)*3^{n-1} + 1/2. Since a_1 = 4, then a_n = (4 - 1/2)*3^{n-1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3^{n-1} + 1/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (7/2)*3^{0} + 1/2 = (7/2)*1 + 1/2 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (7/2)*3^{1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I computed a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So my formula might be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try to derive it again. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{homog} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{part} = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3}/2) - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Which matches my earlier computation. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation.

Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

Therefore, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

    "text": " Plugging in the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, for n=0, if we consider a_0, it's 1 (since the innermost term is 1 + 3, which would be a_1). Wait, actually, maybe n starts at 1, so a_1 = 4. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the recurrence relation as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The standard solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 - c/(r-1)) * r^{n} + c/(r-1), where c is the constant term in the recurrence (here, c=1), and r is the common ratio (here, r=3). So, applying this formula: a_n = (a_1 - 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n} + 1/(3-1) = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n} + 1/2 = (7/2) * 3^{n} + 1/2. Let me verify this formula for n=1: a_1 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = (21/2) + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, that's not correct because a_1 is 4, not 11. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in applying the formula. Let me recall the correct approach. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_0 - c/(r-1)) * r^{n} + c/(r-1). So, in this case, our recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. So, if we take n starting at 1, then a_1 = 4. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. Let me set n = k, starting from k=1. So, a_k = 3*a_{k-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To find a closed-form, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_h = A*3^{k}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = A*3^{k} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this for k=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For k=2: a_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches my earlier calculation. For k=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40, which also matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for the ninth layer, which is k=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods, step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula, lead me to the same answer.

Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049.

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, we can write it as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

So, that's another way to get there without computing each layer step by step. It's interesting because recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows us to find a closed-form solution, which can save time, especially if the number of layers were larger.

The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Comparing both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this method also leads to the same result, confirming that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, another approach could be to recognize that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 3x +1. So, for 9 layers, it's like applying the function f(x) = 3x +1 nine times, starting from x=1. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's similar to applying f(x) = 3x +1, starting from x=1, and applying it 9 times. The result after n applications would be (3^{n} * x + (3^{n} -1)/2). Wait, but in our case, x starts at 1, and the formula we derived earlier is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. So, same as before. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572. I think I've verified it enough ways, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.
