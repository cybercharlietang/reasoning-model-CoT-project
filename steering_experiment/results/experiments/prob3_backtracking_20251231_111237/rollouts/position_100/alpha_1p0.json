Simplifying: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.

So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outer expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outer expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.

Now, set the left side equal to the right side: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, the value is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the earlier result.

    "text": " The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for a_n to compute directly to a_9 without computing each layer. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step, and the formula confirms the result, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication step again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, hold on, that seems conflicting. Wait, let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\nNext digit (tens place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\nNext digit (ten-thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, but when I write it out, the digits would be 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88,572. Wait, but 88,572 is 88 thousand 572, which is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication, let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Then multiply each by 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my computations, and the formula approach aligns with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Comparing both sides, we have B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Therefore, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the original expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, so 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3*B. Then, B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.

Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but in our case, all a_n are integers. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is different. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, then a_2=13, etc., up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which matches our earlier calculation. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result.

For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression. The expression can be expanded as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, each layer is a term in a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. But since we've already solved it using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation, I think we're confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

It's always good to check your work, especially when dealing with nested expressions that can get confusing.

I remember sometimes when I was younger, I'd make mistakes in arithmetic, especially with larger numbers, but taking it one step at a time helps prevent errors. Also, recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation was a good insight because it provided an alternative way to compute the result without manually calculating each layer, which would be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there were more layers. In this case, since there were only nine layers, it was manageable, but for more complex problems, having a formula is really helpful.

Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both the iterative method and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Simplify both sides: Left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equate coefficients: For 3^n: A = A, which holds. For constants: B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So the innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute a_9: 3^{10} is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.
