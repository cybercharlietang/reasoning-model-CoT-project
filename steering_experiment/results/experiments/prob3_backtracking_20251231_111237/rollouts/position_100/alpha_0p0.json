    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assume solution a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I didn't see the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, and it still gives the correct answer. It's good to check my work using different methods to ensure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way.

Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Now, set equal to left side: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers: For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the closed-form without computing each layer, I could use a_9 =29524, then multiply by 3. Either way, the result is the same. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula confirms the step-by-step computation.

Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand it, it's like 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). Wait, but this seems similar to the previous approach. Alternatively, let's consider the entire expression as S. Then, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But how many times does this pattern repeat? Since there are nine layers, S is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with eight more layers inside. Wait, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series. Let me think. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*previous. As we saw, each layer can be represented by a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. So, I think that's solid. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Therefore, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Which matches Layer 2. Similarly, for n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire original expression using the closed-form, it's 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form expression, the result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D + 1. Then, -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our case, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute that: 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 3^{10} directly: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So yes, 3^{10}=59049, then (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the recurrence relation. Let me check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and 3*a_9=88572. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the recurrence relation, I could have continued computing each layer step by step as I did before, and it would have led me to the same result.

For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach led to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer's value, which results in 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, the equation becomes: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Then, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. I think that's solid.

So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.
