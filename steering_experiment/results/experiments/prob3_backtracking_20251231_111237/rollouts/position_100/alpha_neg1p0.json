Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our previous calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so the whole expression is a sum of 3^n terms or something like that, but I think the recurrence approach is clearer here. So, to recap: By computing each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost, we find that each layer's value is 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives us 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the inside out.

But perhaps it's more straightforward to consider the entire expression as a sum. However, given that it's a finite nested expression with 9 layers, it's more practical to compute each layer as I did before. But just for thoroughness, let's see if we can represent this as a sum. Let me write out the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost: S1 = 1 + 3 S2 = 1 + 3*S1 S3 = 1 + 3*S2 ... Up to S9 = 1 + 3*S8 Then the entire expression is 3*S9. As I did before, each S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. So, using the closed-form solution, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as before. So, S9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. The closed-form formula for such a recurrence is helpful because it allows us to compute the value without manually calculating each layer, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step is feasible. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))), with nine layers of 1 + 3. So, starting from the innermost, I computed each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, up to a_9 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88572. I think that's solid.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute this without using the recurrence relation, I could just compute each layer step by step, as I did initially, which seems straightforward enough given that there are only nine layers. Each time, I just multiply by 3 and add 1, so it's a repetitive process but manageable. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use that result in the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process, each time taking the result from the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and moving outward.\n4. After computing all nine layers, I get 29524.\n5. Finally, multiply this by 3 to get the final answer: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I can also check my work by using a calculator or spreadsheet to compute each layer, but since I did it manually and cross-verified with the recurrence relation method, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Another way to think about it is that each layer is effectively building a number in base 3 or something similar, but given that the operations are straightforward, the step-by-step computation is the most direct approach. I think I've covered all the necessary steps and verified the result sufficiently.

    "text": " A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach to verify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this, it's like 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... + 3*3^8. Wait, let me check. Each time you open a parenthesis, you're adding another power of 3. Let me see: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. But if I think about the entire expression, after expanding, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). If I expand all the parentheses, it's equivalent to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))). Let's try to express this as a sum. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))). Let me denote the innermost part as a base case. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. But perhaps it's easier to see that each layer adds a term. Let me try to expand E step by step. Let me compute E as follows: Start with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, as I did before, layer 1: 4, layer 2: 13, layer 3: 40, ..., up to layer 9: 29524. Then, E = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, if I expand E completely, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))). Let me see how many terms there are when fully expanded. Each time you have a 1 plus 3 times something, so when you expand all the parentheses, you get a sum of 1's and 3's multiplied by different powers of 3. Specifically, each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the power corresponding to its depth in the nesting. Let me see: The innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8 (since there are 9 layers, so starting from 0, it's 8). Then the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3^0 = 1. Additionally, each 3 is part of the multiplication, but actually, each layer adds a 1 and a 3 times the next layer. So, when fully expanded, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))). So, the total number of 1's is 9, each multiplied by 3 raised to the power of (number of layers - position - 1). Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as a geometric series with 9 terms where each term is 3^k for k from 0 to 8, but scaled by some factor. Wait, let's try to express E as a sum. Let me denote E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Let me see how many 1's there are. Each layer adds a 1, so there are 9 layers, so 9 ones. Each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the number of layers below it. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3^0 = 1. So, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))). So, when expanded, it's 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + ... + 3^8*1. So, that's a geometric series with 9 terms, first term 1, common ratio 3. The sum of such a series is (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier I had layer 8 as 9841, which is correct because layer 8 is 1 + 3*(layer 7). So, that sum inside the outermost 3*(...) is 9841, then multiplied by 3 gives E = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where layer 9 was 29524. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, let's clarify. If I expand the innermost part, which is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, layer 9 is 29524, and then E = 3*29524 = 88572. But when I thought of the sum as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8, that sum is (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841, and then E = 3*9841 = 29523, which is different. So, where is the mistake here? It seems that the sum approach is not matching the step-by-step computation. Let me check. If I expand the expression inside the outermost 3*(...), it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))). The innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, when I expand all the parentheses, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next by 3^7, etc., up to the outermost 1 multiplied by 3^0. So, the sum inside is 1*(3^8) + 1*(3^7) + ... + 1*(3^0) = (3^9 - 1)/ (3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 9841. Then, E = 3*9841 = 29523. But according to the step-by-step computation, E = 3*29524 = 88572. So, there's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches. Let me check which one is correct. Let me compute E using both methods. First, step-by-step: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 E = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the sum approach: Sum inside = (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841, then E = 3*9841 = 29523. These two results are different, which means one of the approaches is wrong. Let me see where the mistake is. The key is to realize that when you have nested expressions like this, each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the number of multiplications it undergoes. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next by 3^7, etc., up to the outermost 1 multiplied by 3^0. So, the sum inside is indeed 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841. Then, E = 3*9841 = 29523. But according to the step-by-step computation, E is 88572. So, which one is correct? Let me compute E using both methods and see where I went wrong. Let me compute the sum inside: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561. Let me add these up step by step: 1 + 3 = 4 4 + 9 = 13 13 + 27 = 40 40 + 81 = 121 121 + 243 = 364 364 + 729 = 1093 1093 + 2187 = 3280 3280 + 6561 = 9841. So, the sum inside is indeed 9841, which is correct. Then, E = 3*9841 = 29523. But according to the step-by-step computation, E is 88572. So, there must be a mistake in the step-by-step approach. Wait, no, the step-by-step approach was computing layer 9 as 29524, then E = 3*29524 = 88572. But if the sum inside is 9841, which is the value of layer 8, then E = 3*9841 = 29523. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of layers: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me see: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then, each layer wraps around that, so the next is layer 2, up to layer 9, which is the outermost. So, layer 9 is the one that is multiplied by 3 in the final step. So, layer 9 is 1 + 3*(layer 8). Then, E = 3*(layer 9). So, if layer 9 is 29524, then E = 3*29524 = 88572. But according to the sum approach, the sum inside is 9841, which is layer 8, then E = 3*9841 = 29523. So, which is correct? Let me compute layer 9 correctly. Let me compute layer 1 to layer 9 again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, layer 9 is 29524, and E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut according to the sum approach, the sum inside is 9841, which is layer 8, so E = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, so where is the confusion? It seems that in the sum approach, I'm considering the sum inside the outermost 3*(...) as 9841, which is layer 8, but actually, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so perhaps the sum approach is not directly applicable because the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9), and the sum inside layer 9 is 9841, but layer 9 is 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to compute each layer step by step, leading to E = 88572.\n\nI think the confusion came from whether the sum inside the outermost 3*(...) is layer 9 or layer 8. It's actually layer 9, which is 29524, so E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1: a_1 = 4 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which checks out. Similarly, layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches our earlier computation. So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which is exactly what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's thorough enough. I double-checked each layer, found a pattern, derived a formula, and confirmed the result using both iterative computation and the closed-form solution.
