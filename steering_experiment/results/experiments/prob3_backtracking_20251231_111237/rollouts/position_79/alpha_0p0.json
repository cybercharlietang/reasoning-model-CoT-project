Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, I might consider if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula helped confirm that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, leading to a pattern where each layer is 4, 13, 40, 121, etc., each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. But since the problem has nine layers, computing each step manually would be time-consuming, so finding a formula is more efficient. However, since the problem only has nine layers, doing it step by step is manageable, as I did earlier. Either way, both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine that the outermost layer equals 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without going through each layer manually. Maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, so L_9 would be the innermost layer, and then the outermost expression is 3*L_9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition. Wait, but in this case, a = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula would be L_n = a^{n} * (L_0 - b/(1 - a)) + b/(1 - a). Wait, let me check. Actually, for a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n} * (L_0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, let me verify that. Let me consider the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n^{(h)} = a*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*a^{n}. For the particular solution, since b is a constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a). Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*a^{n} + b/(1 - a). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, L_1 is the first layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4. Therefore, 4 = C*a^{1} + b/(1 - a). Substituting a=3 and b=1: 4 = C*3 + 1/(1 - 3) = 3C + 1/(-2) = 3C - 1/2. Therefore, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} + 1/(1 - 3) = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost layer is L_1, and the outermost expression is 3*L_9. Wait, no, actually, let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is L_1 = 1 + 3 =4, then L_2 =1 + 3*L_1, etc., up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, using the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which is much faster. So, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think if I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with n layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13.

Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified by recognizing a recursive pattern.

Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for the homogeneous solution, if we consider the recurrence a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, the particular solution can be found. Alternatively, since the recurrence is linear, we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recursive approach and verifying with a closed-form formula, we determine that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final result after multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, computing each one isn't too bad. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for the nth term. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Substituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. So I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation provides a closed-form formula, which confirms the result obtained by step-by-step computation. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it in another way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. That's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right-hand side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, we have A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have Layer 9, which is the outermost layer. So, substituting n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute it another way. Alternatively, I can consider the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand the entire expression, it's going to be a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try expanding it.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), not adding 3^k each time. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to express the entire expression as a sum. Let me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) There are nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me try to express this as a sum. Each time, we have a 1 and then a 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) can be expressed as a geometric series with ratio 3, but I need to think carefully. Let me consider that each layer adds another term. Wait, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1))) where there are nine 3*1 terms? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Let me see if I can express this as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to expand the expression step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me denote each nested part:\n\nLet me start from the innermost part and work my way out.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, same as before. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with some offset. Let me see.\n\nGiven that each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and we have 9 layers, the total expression before multiplying by the outermost 3 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nThen, E = 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it. So, E = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572.\n\nThat's a much quicker way once you recognize the pattern.\n\nSo, the key was to recognize that each layer follows the recurrence L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which leads to a geometric progression, allowing us to compute the nth term using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times and using different methods, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, it's a geometric series perhaps? Let me see. Let me denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait, this seems like a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. So, we can model this as a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. But we also have L_n = A*3^n + B. Therefore, setting equal: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. If I let S be the entire expression inside the first set of parentheses, then S = 1 + 3*S', where S' is the next layer. But since each layer is similar, perhaps S' = S. Wait, no, because each layer is actually a different level. Maybe this approach isn't as straightforward. Alternatively, since I found a formula using the recurrence relation, that was more efficient. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break down the expression starting from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think about this expression as a geometric series or a recurrence relation, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable. However, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for such nested expressions. Let's see, if each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*Layer9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire expression in terms of the formula, it's 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer and applying the formula for the nth layer, we find the result to be 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0.

So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, let's substitute into the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is a_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step. That's much faster, especially if there were more layers. But since there were only nine layers, both methods worked. It's good to know both approaches: one for when the number of layers isn't too large, and another for when it's more efficient to find a pattern or formula.

This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Let's try expanding the recurrence a few times to see if a pattern emerges. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 Hmm, wait, this seems like powers of 3. Let me see: a_1 = 4 = (3^2 + 1)/1? Wait, 3^2 is 9, 9 + 1 = 10, which isn't 4. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sum of a geometric series. Let me consider the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Great, so the formula holds. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final answer. So, 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11 -3 = 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144 /2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, whether I compute step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize the pattern and apply the formula, I end up with the same result. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure the answer is correct. So, in conclusion, after carefully working through each layer and confirming with a closed-form formula, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. It might be a form of a geometric progression, but since each term is nested, it's more like recursively defined. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))). If there are n layers, it's a geometric series. But in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, computing each L_i up to 9 gives us the value. As I computed before, L_9 = 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute one more layer to check the pattern. Let's say, for example, if there was only one layer, it would be 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. If there are two layers, 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had Layer 2 as 13, which is correct, and then 3*13 = 39. But in the problem, there are nine layers, so the computation goes up to L_9 and then multiplied by 3. So, yes, I think my approach is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each layer again, but this time using another approach, perhaps looking for a pattern or formula. Wait, each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Layer n. This recurrence relation is: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, for the recurrence, L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1. Plugging the general solution into the recurrence: (A*3^n + B) - 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1. Simplify: A*3^n + B - 3A*3^(n-1) - 3B = 1. 3A*3^(n-1) - 3A*3^(n-1) cancels out, leaving B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, from the initial condition: 4 = 3A + (-1/2). So, 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula for a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then adds 1. But in this case, the formula I found seems sufficient. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to see if it holds. Let's compute Layer 5 using the formula: L(5) = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Which matches what I had before. So, that's correct. Therefore, I'm confident that my calculations are correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). How many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears nested. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is one layer. Let me count the number of layers. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3. Then, moving out, each time we have another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is written as 3(1+3(...)) with nine layers. So, my approach seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate coefficients: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, which we've now computed as 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute it again using the formula: L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*29524 =88572. Yes, that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29,524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems correct. Hmm, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me try to see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as we computed earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. I know that for such linear recursions, the solution can be found using the method for solving linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The general solution is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_{n+1} - 3a_n = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3a_p = 1 => -2a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, using the recurrence relation approach also leads me to the same answer. I think that confirms that 88572 is the correct result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. But I think the recurrence relation approach was more straightforward here. Just to be thorough, let me try to compute the layers again from scratch to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's not the correct way to break it down because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit as I did before, which also gives 88572. So, after verifying each step multiple times, I'm confident that the final answer is indeed 88572. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work thoroughly, so I don't see any mistakes now. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer helped a lot. I also tried using the recurrence relation method, which gave me the same result, so that double-checking made me more confident in the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds a term that is 3^n. Wait, let me see: If I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, expanding all the way, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to write this as a sum. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me think recursively. Each layer is 1 + 3*next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. So, if I think about it, the entire expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Wait, but that's 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, but when I expand it, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Wait, that's 4 terms. So, each layer adds another term. So, layer 1: 1 + 3^1 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. And so on. So, in general, layer n: sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but that's the formula for a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of r^k is (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). In this case, r=3, so sum = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. But wait, in our case, each layer starts at k=0? Wait, no. Let me see: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1. So, sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k is 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k = 13. Layer 3: sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k = 40. So, yes, each layer n corresponds to sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Therefore, layer n has sum = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, as before. Then, the entire expression is 3 times layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Then: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Then: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that's consistent with all previous methods. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. To make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute the multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4*3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 + 1=7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5*3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9*3=27 + 1=28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 + 2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Let me verify that: 30000*3=90000. 476*3=1428. So, 90000 - 1428=88572. Correct. So, that's another way to compute it and confirm the result. Therefore, after carefully working through each step, checking my computations, and verifying using different methods, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without manually calculating each layer, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3a_2. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), I can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer, which is much faster, especially if there are more layers. But since I only had nine layers, it wasn't too bad to compute each step manually. However, knowing the formula is useful for future problems. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, I was able to compute the value efficiently.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find the closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " Let me go back through each layer to check for any errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then the final step: 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes I might make a mistake there. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method. Let's add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524 = Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number, starting from 1. So a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, which in this case is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c). Wait, let me make sure. The standard solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s is a_n = (a_1 - s/(1 - r)) * r^{n} + s/(1 - r). Wait, perhaps I should derive it. Let me try. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4. a_2 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. a_3 = 3*13 + 1 = 40. a_4 = 3*40 + 1 = 121. a_5 = 3*121 + 1 = 364. a_6 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093. a_7 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280. a_8 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841. a_9 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Now, to find a general formula for a_n, let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a general formula, which confirms the computed value. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4, as we saw. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is L_9, we have L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I computed earlier, so that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

So yes, that seems correct. I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is a recursive structure. In fact, this resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let's denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, solving this recurrence relation might give a closed-form expression, which could save time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me try to solve this recurrence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count them: Starting from the innermost, each \"(\" adds a layer until we reach the outermost. Let me count: The innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1. Then each subsequent \"(\" adds a layer. Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). So, how many layers? Starting from the innermost: 1+3: layer 1. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(...)\": 1. 3*(1 + 3(...)) starting at the innermost: layer 1. Then moving out, each \"(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: The first ( after 3 is the start of layer 1. Then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3: 1. ( after 3: layer 1. 2. ( after that: layer 2. 3. ( : layer 3. 4. ( : layer 4. 5. ( : layer 5. 6. ( : layer 6. 7. ( : layer 7. 8. ( : layer 8. 9. ( : layer 9. Wait, but when I look at the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, which is layer 1. Then each step out adds another layer. So, how many layers? Let me see: The innermost is layer 1: 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"1 + 3(...)\" starting from the innermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( adds a layer. Let me count:\n\n1. ( after 3: layer 1\n2. ( after that: layer 2\n3. ( : layer 3\n4. ( : layer 4\n5. ( : layer 5\n6. ( : layer 6\n7. ( : layer 7\n8. ( : layer 8\n9. ( : layer 9\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, after the initial 3, the first ( is followed by 1+3, then another (, and so on until the ninth (, and then the expression starts closing the parentheses. So, actually, the number of layers is 9. Because each ( adds a new layer, and there are 9 ( after the initial 3. Therefore, n=9. Therefore, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, with n=9, we get a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer. So, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Let me try to expand it a bit to see if it can be represented as a sum.\n\nLet me denote S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) If I expand this, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to write it out step by step:\n\nFirst, the innermost part is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, as we computed earlier, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nBut maybe if I expand S, I can represent it as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me consider that each time we have a term like 3^k * 1, and the total sum would be a combination of these. But perhaps that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, since we've already derived a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*a_n, which becomes (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nIn our case, n=9, so it's (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of a geometric series. Let me try that.\n\nThe expression S is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers.\n\nLet me try to write S as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) where the inner expression is similar to S but with fewer layers.\n\nWait, but S itself is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so if I let the inner expression be similar, perhaps I can write an equation for S in terms of itself.\n\nWait, but in this case, S is the entire expression, which is 3*(...). Let me define T as the inner expression: T = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with 8 layers. Then, S = 3*(T). Similarly, T = 1 + 3*(another expression with 7 layers), and so on.\n\nBut perhaps this approach isn't as straightforward as using the recurrence relation we already solved.\n\nIn any case, I've verified the answer through multiple methods: step-by-step computation, solving the recurrence relation, and using the formula for the sum. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- The problem is a nested expression with 9 layers.\n- Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n- The innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4.\n- Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous result).\n- After computing up to the 9th layer, we get 29524.\n- Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result, 88572.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the alternative methods confirm the result. So, I think I'm done here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions to save time in the future. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can compute a_1 through a_9 as I did before. But maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 -1/2 =9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the 9th layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so 177147 -3=177144, then 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form formula. It's good to know that both methods give the same result, so I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've covered all the steps and even found a pattern and a formula to generalize this kind of problem. It was a bit time-consuming, but breaking it down layer by layer and then finding a formula helped me understand the problem better.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait a moment. Let me check 3*29524 again. Maybe I should compute it differently. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000=87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I computed each layer, I assumed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). But looking back at the original expression, I see that it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 times (something), where that something is 1 + 3*(another something). So, I correctly computed each layer up to Layer 9, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let's see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for example, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. Then, the expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n in terms of n.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we're dealing with Layer 9, which is a_9, let's compute a_9.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, which is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. It's interesting because it shows that the entire expression can be computed using a formula without having to compute each layer step by step, which is especially useful if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer step by step without errors, and the formula confirms the result, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to be absolutely thorough, let me check 3^11 again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, 3^11=177147\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.\n\nIn summary, the approach was:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result as I went along.\n\n3. After computing up to the ninth layer, multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n4. Alternatively, derive a general formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation, then compute the ninth layer using the formula, and then multiply by 3.\n\nBoth methods led to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't think of any steps I might have missed or any errors in the computations. Each layer built upon the previous one correctly, and the formula approach corroborated the step-by-step computation. So, I'm satisfied with the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain progression. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, just to verify. Let me see if there's a recursive formula here. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence approach also led me to the same result.

Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. But just to explore, is there a formula for such a nested expression? Let me think. The expression is of the form: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote the nth term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2= 3C -1/2. Solving for C: 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few terms. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms the answer using both the step-by-step computation and the formula. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested recurrence relation where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting with 4, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a geometric series perhaps? Let me think. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. Suppose I have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I have. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has 9 layers, it's manageable to compute each step as I did. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for a_n in terms of a geometric series. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write out the terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, as I computed earlier, a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that this is a finite geometric series. The recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to compute each layer step by step. That might be faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, both methods work. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth term, which simplifies the computation. Applying this formula to the 9th layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me denote each Layer n as a_n. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find A and B. Given that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, let's write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers we computed. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with multiple layers. This is similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each layer is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such an expression. Suppose I have n layers. Then, the value would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. Let me denote the value of k layers as V_k. Then, V_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. V_2 = 1 + 3*V_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. V_3 = 1 + 3*V_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Which is what I had before. So, in general, V_{k} = 1 + 3*V_{k-1}. This is a recursive relation. The solution to this recurrence relation can be found. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for V_k. The recurrence is V_k = 1 + 3*V_{k-1}, with V_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving V_k - 3*V_{k-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is V_k - 3*V_{k-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is V_k^{(h)} = C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form V_k^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is V_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition V_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is V_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For k=1: V_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For k=2: V_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: V_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for k=9 layers, V_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, V_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*V_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. I think that confirms that the answer is correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 to make sure. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, V_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, maybe. Let me see if there's another way to approach it without computing each layer step by step. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). There are nine layers of 1 + 3, each multiplied by 3 except the innermost one. Wait, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps this can be represented recursively. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, L(1) = 4 L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, recognizing that this is a recurrence relation where L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_p(n) = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see: Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)). But since I already solved it step by step and verified using the recurrence relation, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524*3: Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 =87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). If I expand it all the way, it's 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} multiplied by something. Wait, but in our case, each term is multiplied by 3, so perhaps the expansion is a sum of powers of 3. Let me try that. The expression a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}. Wait, is that true? Let me check for n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(4) = 13. If I expand it as 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Yes, that works. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Expanding: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Correct. So, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches our earlier result. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. So, again, the same answer. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, I can compute the sum directly. The sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, all methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's also compute a few terms to see the pattern. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the sequence goes 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the closed-form solution would involve 3^n, as I thought.\n\nLet me set up the equation for the closed-form. Assume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nBut a_n is also equal to A*3^n + B.\n\nTherefore, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 =13. L_3=1 +3*L_2=1+39=40. Hmm, is there a pattern here? Let's see the sequence: L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. Hmm, that looks familiar. It seems like each term is multiplied by 3 and then 2 is subtracted or something? Let me check: From L1=4 to L2=13: 4*3 +1=13. Yes, because 4*3=12 +1=13. From L2=13 to L3=40: 13*3 +1=40. Because 13*3=39 +1=40. Similarly, L3=40: 40*3 +1=121. Yes, that works. L4=121: 121*3 +1=364. Correct. L5=364: 364*3 +1=1093. Correct. L6=1093: 1093*3 +1=3280. Correct. L7=3280: 3280*3 +1=9841. Correct. L8=9841: 9841*3 +1=29524. Correct. So, each L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1. That's a linear recurrence relation. So, in general, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L1=4. So, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me think about solving this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^(h) = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution L_n^(p) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, Layer 9 is L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I double-checked each layer, and the recurrence relation approach also led me to the same result.

Solving this recurrence, we derive a closed-form formula: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, each time, we're doing a linear operation. Maybe this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = (L_1 - b/(a-1)) * a^{n-1} + b/(a-1). Let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. So, assuming a particular solution L_p = K, then substituting into the recurrence: K = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a). Wait, but in our case, a=3, so K = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. Hmm, but our initial terms are positive, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is L_n = (L_1 - K)*a^{n-1} + K, where K = b/(1 - a). Let me try that. So, K = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. Then, L_n = (L_1 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2). Since L_1 =4, this becomes L_n = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me test this for n=1: L_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} -1/2 = (9/2)*1 -1/2 = 9/2 -1/2 =8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} -1/2 = (9/2)*3 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(9/2)*3^2 -1/2=(9/2)*9 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} -1/2. Let me compute that. First, compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Then, L_9=(9/2)*6561 -1/2. Let's compute (9/2)*6561 first. 9/2 is 4.5, so 4.5 * 6561. Alternatively, 6561 * 9 = 59049, then divide by 2: 59049 / 2 =29524.5. Then subtract 1/2: 29524.5 -0.5=29524. So, L_9=29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572, as before. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work using two different methods: iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation. Both approaches led me to the same final answer, so I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers. Looking at the results of each layer: Layer 1: 4 = (3 +1) = 4 Layer 2: 13 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 40 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 121 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 364 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1093 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 3280 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 9841 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 29524 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 It seems each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let me think about it. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2. And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, for n >=2, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 =4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, both methods work. It's good to know both ways: the step-by-step computation for verification and the formula for efficiency. So, after all that, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). Using a recursive approach or a derived formula, the solution is computed as follows:\n\n1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the initial condition, when n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for the recurrence relation, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Let's find B. Assume the particular solution is a constant B. Then, plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: 4 = 3A + (-1/2). So, 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9 corresponds to L_9, so n=9, so exponent is n+1=10. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to compute this without going through each layer, using the formula. Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. I went through each layer step by step, double-checked with a formula, and both methods gave me the same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each layer. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it as such. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since there are only nine terms, computing them step by step is manageable. However, for the sake of understanding, let's see if we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.

This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.
