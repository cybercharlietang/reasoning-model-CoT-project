    "text": " Let me check the structure again. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by another expression). So, the first layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, there's another 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and this repeats. So maybe I should consider each step as a function of the previous one. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start from the innermost part, which is the 1 + 3 at the very end. Let me write that down:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So Layer 2 would be:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, that's 13. Next layer out, Layer 3, would be:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nOkay, Layer 4 is 121. Moving on.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364. Next.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093. Continuing.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280. Next.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, Layer 9 is 29524, but the entire expression is 3 times that. So, the final computation would be:\n\nFinal result: 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n5*3 = 15, plus 1 carried over is 16, write down 6, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7, write down 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 = 15, plus 2 carried over is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that again because it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. The original expression has 9 layers, right? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1)\n3. 1 + 3*(2)\n4. 1 + 3*(3)\n5. 1 + 3*(4)\n6. 1 + 3*(5)\n7. 1 + 3*(6)\n8. 1 + 3*(7)\n9. 1 + 3*(8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(9). So, yes, that's 9 layers, each time multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, each Layer n is 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, the computations I did earlier for each layer seem correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is defined by the recurrence relation Layer(n) = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is Layer(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me try to find A and B.\n\nGiven Layer(n) = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), and Layer(1) = 4.\n\nAssume Layer(n) = A*3^n + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition Layer(1) = 4:\n\nLayer(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo,\n\n3A - 1/2 = 4\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is:\n\nLayer(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nLayer(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Layer(9):\n\nLayer(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, Layer(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each Layer(n) is following a geometric sequence. Since each term is 3 times the previous plus 1, it's similar to a geometric series. The closed-form formula for such a recurrence is indeed (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, as I derived earlier.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, I can compute Layer(9) directly without computing each intermediate layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable, albeit a bit tedious.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute Layer(9) using the formula:\n\nLayer(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYep, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked my work enough times, and both methods lead me to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me see. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (...))). So each layer is multiplied by 3 after adding 1. So, maybe it's better to compute each layer starting from the inside. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost expression. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times L9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the final result would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 3 * 29,000 = 87,000. 3 * 524 = 1,572. So, adding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems straightforward. Wait, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do it step by step. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So adding them: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3 * 29,524. Let's compute that again: 29,524 * 3. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Each step seems correct. Maybe I can compute a couple of layers again to verify. Let's check L5: L4 is 121, so 3*121=363; 1 + 363=364. Correct. L6: 3*364=1092; 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. L7: 3*1093=3279; 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. L8: 3*3280=9840; 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. L9: 3*9841=29,523; 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct. Then 3*29,524=88,572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the nth layer. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually might be more straightforward. However, for practice, let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form expression is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L9, which is the 9th layer. So, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, L9=(59049 - 1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, the closed-form approach also gives me 88,572. That's a good confirmation. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series, but given the structure, it's more of a nested multiplication rather than a simple geometric series. But it's interesting that the closed-form solution worked out so neatly. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer step by step from the inside out, I arrived at the innermost value of 4, then built each subsequent layer by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer was 29,524, and multiplying that by 3 gave me the final result of 88,572. Alternatively, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression confirmed the same result without having to compute each intermediate step. Both methods led me to the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let me check again. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, maybe the innermost part is Layer 1, which is 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, perhaps I should compute each Layer from 1 to 9, each time substituting the previous Layer's value into the next. Let me try that approach. Let's define each Layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9, then the total expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, but let me count the number of layers. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each time we go out, we have another 1 + 3*(previous Layer). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. It's 1, then another, up to 9. So, the innermost is the 9th layer, and then each layer going out is the next one. So, the innermost is Layer 9: 1 + 3, then Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 9), and so on, up to Layer 1, which is the outermost (1 + 3*(Layer 2)), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1).

Let's break it down:\n29524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8\nSo, reading from top: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 write down 7\n5 * 3 =15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n2 *3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8\nSo, the number is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3, the first ( is at position 1: 3(1+3(1+3(... So that's the first layer. Each time we have another (1+3(... So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each preceding ( adds another layer. Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to see that each time we have a 1+3(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears, which is 9 times. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. Therefore, we have 9 layers, each computed as above, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, so that would be correct. So, each Layer from 1 to 9 is correctly computed, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but since the number of terms is small (only 9), computing each term step by step is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, can be solved. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B \u2192 B = 1 + 3B \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B, where B = -1/2.\n\nWe found A = 3/2, so a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, because (3^{n+1}/2) - (1/2) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost layer:\n\n- **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me see: The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times another expression). So maybe each layer is actually 3 times (1 + 3 times the next layer). Let me correct that. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, that might make more sense. So, perhaps I should compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward to Layer 9, then multiply the final result by 3. Let me try that approach. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Calculating 3*40 gives 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding them together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 is a bit larger, so I need to compute this carefully. Let's break it down: 9841 * 3. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recursively defined sequence. Let me try to find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88,572. Just to make sure, I'll compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yep, that's correct. Then, subtracting 1 gives 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer, we find that the value of the entire expression is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me start with the innermost layer. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving outward, L2 would be 1 + 3*(L1). So, substituting L1: L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so L2 is 13. Now, L3 is 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So, L3 is 40. Moving on to L4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. L4 is 121. Next, L5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. L5 is 364. Now, L6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. L6 is 1093. Continuing to L7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. L7 is 3280. Next, L8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. L8 is 9841. Now, L9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, L9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount the layers.

So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...))\n\nWait, but the innermost one is \"1+3)\", so actually, each \"1+3(\" is followed by another until the last one is \"1+3)\". So, perhaps there are 8 layers? Wait, no, let me parse it correctly.\n\nLet me write it out step by step:\n\nStarting with the innermost: 1+3\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I have 9 layers. The original expression has 9 sets of \"1+3(\", each nested within the previous. So, yes, 9 layers, each adding another 1+3*(...). So, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute a_9: 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n = 9\\), \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time it's 1+3(...), so from the innermost, it's Layer 1: 1 + 3, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9, because I count nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me check that again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time we go one layer out, we have another 1+3(...). So, let's count: 1. The innermost is 1+3, that's Layer 1. 2. The next layer out is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), that's Layer 2. 3. Then 1 + 3*(Layer 2) is Layer 3. Continuing this way, how many layers do we have? Let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and inside each 1 + 3*(...), there are 8 more layers. Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. Let me try to parse the expression step by step. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...))). Each time, the expression inside is 1 + 3*(another expression). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and working outward, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the opening parentheses: 3( ... ) where inside, it's 1+3( ... ). Each time, we have a new opening parenthesis. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first layer is 3*(...), then inside it, there's 1+3*(...), and so on. Let me count the number of 3*(...) parts. From the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time we go out, we have another 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each time we go one layer out, we add another 1+3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. The innermost is 1+3, then each time we have another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1: 1 + 3, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on. Let me count the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and inside, each time we have another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen?

Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, we have a 1 + 3*(...), and the number of layers is 9. Because starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, because the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total number of layers is 9, but the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, perhaps the layers are 1 through 9, with the outermost being Layer 9, which is then multiplied by 3. So, to compute this, I need to compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2 using Layer 1, and so on until Layer 9, and then multiply by 3. So, let's start computing each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nWait, but let me check that again because 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n_________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2\n\n2*3=6+2=8, write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there a pattern here? Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Maybe I can find a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time if there are more layers. Let me think about this.\n\nLooking at each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 29,524\n\nI notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, Layer n = 3*(Layer n-1) + 1. That makes sense because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, that's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for the nth term.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 =88,572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBecause 3*(3^{10}) =3^{11}, and 3*(-1) = -3.\n\nSo, yes, the entire expression is (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88,572.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute the result more efficiently without having to compute each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I can't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula approach corroborates the step-by-step computation.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Solving this recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the 9th layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).

    "text": " Let me see: The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times something). So, maybe the innermost part is the first 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{part} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me check: The innermost layer is 1+3, which is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3 \u00d7 4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3 \u00d7 13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3 \u00d7 40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3 \u00d7 121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3 \u00d7 364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3 \u00d7 1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3 \u00d7 3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3 \u00d7 9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost 3 by Layer 9:\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88,572\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me check the original problem again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and inside that, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times another expression. So, perhaps the innermost expression is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer wraps that with another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost part: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result should be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 =1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, that's interesting. So, for example, when n=1, a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Which matches. For n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, the value of the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is 1+3=4. Then, each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one, up to layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). Let's compute a_9 first using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both methods, computing each layer step by step and using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88,572. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me check again. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (another expression)), and so on. So maybe each layer is multiplied by 3. Let me try to parse it correctly. Let me write the expression again, but this time, I'll assign each layer a number to keep track. Let me start from the innermost part and work my way out.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost Layer: 1 + 3\n\nWait, that's just 1 + 3, which is 4. So Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext layer out: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: that's 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121: Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. So 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093: Let's compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9841: Let me compute that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 * 29524.\n\nSo now, I need to compute 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 30000*3 is 90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So 3*(30000 - 476) = 90000 - 3*476.\n\nCompute 3*476: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So 1200 + 210 = 1410, plus 18 is 1428.\n\nSo 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me do it digit by digit.\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me check my layers again because I might have miscounted the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nWait, so each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" parts.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time I see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n   - Inside, first \"1+3(\" is layer 1\n   - Then inside that, \"1+3(\" is layer 2\n   - And so on until the innermost.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is \"1+3)\", so that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each step out adds another layer.\n\nSo in total, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen the outermost is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo that's 9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify my computations step by step because it's easy to make an arithmetic error in these nested calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check each step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving the recurrence relation to see if I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nGiven:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, using this formula, we can compute each layer directly without having to compute each step manually, which would be especially useful if the number of layers were larger.\n\nNow, since the original expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572, as we computed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine the value of each layer until we reach the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3))\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), each nested inside the previous one, and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3. So, maybe I can compute each layer from the inside out, starting with the innermost one, which is just 1 + 3. Let's try that. Let me write down each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. I think I might have miscounted the layers because when I started, I thought there were 9 layers, but let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach time I see a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1 + 3:\n\n1. The first 3(1 + 3(...\n2. Then another (1 + 3(...\n3. And so on, until the innermost part is (1 + 3)).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses. Each \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer. So, starting from the outermost 3(1 + 3(...), each time I see another \"(\", that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3))\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers. But when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524. But then the entire expression is 3 times that Layer 9 result. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result is 3 * 29524.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because in the original expression, the outermost 3 multiplies the entire expression inside, which is Layer 9. So yes, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final answer is 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let's do this step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\nx      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I correctly computed each layer. Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me recount the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3 times that: 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: Let's compute 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's a different way. Wait, 29524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nBut actually, 29524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20,000*3=60,000\n\n9,000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the number of layers in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" expressions.\n\nStarting from the outermost:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3)).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1 + 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer. So, starting from the outermost, each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer.\n\nLet me write down the structure:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(...)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(...)\n\n...\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The first one after the outermost 3: 3(1 + 3(...)\n2. Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...): that's the second layer.\n3. Continuing, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances:\n\nStarting from the outermost:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, each layer corresponds to a \"1 + 3(\" expression, and the innermost is just 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer builds on the previous one.\n\nSo, yes, I computed up to Layer 9, which is 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused now because sometimes when you have expressions like this, the number of layers can be miscounted, leading to an error in the computation. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's denote each layer as a function. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, so maybe the function is slightly different. Let me think.\n\nActually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so it's 3 times f(n), where f(n) is defined as 1 + 3*f(n-1), starting with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would be 3*f(n), where f(n) is the inner expression. So, perhaps f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, we had Layer 1 as 4, Layer 2 as 13, etc., which aligns with f(1)=4, f(2)=13, f(3)=40, etc.\n\nSo, if we have 9 layers, then f(9) would be the innermost expression, and the total expression is 3*f(9).\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, Layer 1 was the innermost, which was 4, and Layer 9 was the outermost inner expression, which was 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nBut let me check using the function approach.\n\nDefine f(n) as the value of the inner expression with n layers. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*f(n), where n is the number of layers.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*(f(n)), where f(n) is the inner expression with n layers. So, if we have 9 layers, then the total expression is 3*f(9).\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, we computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, which would be f(9), and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nBut let me check f(n) with n=9.\n\nGiven f(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, f(9) = 29524, then the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with our earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is f(n) - 3f(n-1) = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say f_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4.\n\nSo, f(1) = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: f(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: f(4) = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nThus, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, n=9, so f(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, f(9)= (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result using a different method, the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, f(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step and used two different methods: iterative computation of each layer and using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. Both methods led to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the result is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 + 3 times the next nested term. There are 9 layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by the Outermost 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88,572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me check the structure again. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something). So, the outermost operation is 3*(...). Then inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, maybe it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, computing each nested expression step by step. Let me try that approach. Let's start from the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3 That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, Layer 9 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) We already know Layer 9 is 4, so this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 8 = 13. Next, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Layer 8 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 7 = 40. Continuing this way, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) Layer 7 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 6 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) Layer 6 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 4 = 1093. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) Layer 4 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 3 = 3280. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) Layer 3 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 2 = 9841. Layer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) Layer 2 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Layer 1 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think I did this right. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and working methodically from the inside out ensures that I don't make a mistake. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it step by step helps prevent errors. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could simplify this calculation. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. If I consider each layer as a term in a geometric series, perhaps I can find a formula for the nth term. Let's see. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, that's exactly what I did before. So, each layer is a term in a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have nine layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Wait, actually, in our original problem, the innermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_1=4, then Layer 8 is a_2=13, and so on, up to Layer 1, which is a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{9+1} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which matches my earlier result. So, using the formula, I can compute the value without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's much more efficient, especially if there are many layers. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allows for a more elegant solution. I think I'll stick with this method for future problems of a similar nature. It saves time and reduces the chance of calculation errors when dealing with multiple layers of nesting. So, to summarize my approach: 1. Recognize the nested structure and the repeating pattern. 2. Identify that each layer follows a recurrence relation. 3. Solve the recurrence relation to find a general formula for each layer. 4. Apply the formula to find the value of the innermost layer and work outward. 5. Multiply the final result by 3 to get the overall value. This systematic approach ensures accuracy and efficiency, even with complex nested expressions.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 9):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 1:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Outermost Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me check the structure again. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (...))). So, each layer is inside another layer. Let me try to parse it correctly. Let me write the expression step by step, starting from the innermost part. The innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, perhaps I should compute each layer starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3. Let me try that approach. Let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. Layer 1 is 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo Layer 2 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 3*13 = 39\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121: Let me compute that. 120*3=360, and 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363.\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364. Let's break it down: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093. Let's do this step by step:\n\n1000*3=3000\n\n90*3=270\n\n3*3=9\n\nAdd them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280. Let's compute 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841. Let's break this down:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nNow add them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 again. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow add them:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, yes, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, but I just realized that the original expression has nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, when I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, that's correct. So the total number of layers is nine, each time adding another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, computing each layer step by step up to Layer 9 and then multiplying by 3 gives me 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach would work. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nCompute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, and we have a_9 as computed. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the value after nine layers. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and the total expression is 3*a_9, then using the general formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nWhich again matches the previous result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the general formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be confident that this is the correct result. It's a large number, but given the repeated multiplication by 3, it's expected that the numbers would grow exponentially.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me verify a few key steps again.\n\nWhen computing 3*9841, I got 29523, which is correct because 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Correct.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all the steps check out. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer as we go.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me parse it again. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times another expression). So, maybe I should consider each step as 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). Hmm, that might be a better way to think about it. Let me try to write it down step by step. Let's define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say L1 is the innermost part: L1 = 1 + 3 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 ... and so on, up to L9, and the entire expression is 3*L9. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(L9). So, maybe I should compute L1 through L9, each time plugging into the next layer. Let me try that. Starting with the innermost: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*L9, so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do the multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3 again. 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent L_n is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n, which could save me from computing each layer manually. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my earlier calculation. Good.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3^10 again to be sure. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, so 3^10=(3^5)^2=243^2=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 3*(previous layer) +1, but in this case, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is similar but not exactly the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the results I computed earlier:\n\nL1=4= (3^2 -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4.\n\nL2=13=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13.\n\nL3=40=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40.\n\nYes, so indeed, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. To be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's see, starting from the innermost and working out:\n\nInnermost: 1+3=4\n\nNext layer: 1+3*4=13\n\nNext: 1+3*13=40\n\nNext: 1+3*40=121\n\nNext: 1+3*121=364\n\nNext: 1+3*364=1093\n\nNext: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nNext: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nNext: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nFinally, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated. The innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer's value by 3. The final answer is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, perhaps I should consider each step as computing the innermost part first and then working my way out. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me start by computing the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 9: 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 8 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 8 is 13. Now, Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 7 is 40. Next, Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 6 is 121. Moving on, Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 121*3. 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So, 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 4 is 1093. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 3 is 3280. Moving to Layer 2, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 2 is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer is Layer 1, which is 3*(Layer 2) = 3*9841. Let me compute that: 9841*3. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.

Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.

Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result should be 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 again: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let me compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, yes, 88572 seems to be correct.\n\nWait, but that seems like a very large number, and I'm wondering if I counted the layers correctly. Let me count the number of layers again. Starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer. Let me see: Each time I add another layer, so the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So, yes, 9 layers in total. Therefore, my calculation of 88572 seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps something that can be represented recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, each layer is defined recursively. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc., as I computed before. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. In this case, c=3 and d=1. Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, comparing to the standard form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, we have c=3 and d=1. The initial condition is a_1=4, but let's check: When n=1, a_1=1+3=4. Alternatively, maybe we can index it starting from a_0. Let me see: If I let a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 =1 + 3*4=13, which matches. So, perhaps it's better to index starting from a_0=1. Then, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have.\n\nFor n=0: a_0 = (3^{1} -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, correct.\n\nn=1: a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=29524, correct.\n\nSo, yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n starts at 0. Therefore, for our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, which is when n=1. Wait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, which would correspond to n=9. Wait, no, let me clarify. The innermost layer is a_1=4, which is computed as 1+3. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous). So, after 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572, which matches my earlier calculation. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. Yes, that's the same result. So, using the formula, I can directly compute the result without going through each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive formula, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. The final result is calculated as 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, starting from L1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, L1 was 4, L2 was 13, which is 3*4 + 1 = 13, correct. L3 = 3*13 + 1 = 40, correct. So yes, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L(n) = A*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_p. Let's set L_p = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer9, which is L9, n=9: L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I got 88,572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula for L(n). Since L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L(n), where n=9. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is building up a geometric series. But since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit more involved, but the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nSo, to recap, I started by evaluating the innermost parentheses and worked my way out, calculating each layer step by step. Then, I found a pattern where each layer can be expressed using a recurrence relation, which allowed me to compute the value without manually expanding each layer. Both methods led me to the same result, which gives me confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation method gave me the same result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me check again. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something). So, maybe the layers are the innermost 1 + 3, then each time you add another 1 + 3(...). So, perhaps I should start by computing the innermost parentheses first. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost Layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, so if I compute each layer step by step, each time substituting the innermost result into the next layer, that might work.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo,\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4\n\nThen, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)\n\nAnd so on, until L9.\n\nWait, but actually, the expression given is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, maybe the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outward, each time computing the value inside the parentheses and then moving out.\n\nBut perhaps I should think of each layer as a term being added inside the next multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Let me see.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that each time, the expression is of the form 1 + 3*(something). If I let x = 1 + 3x, that would be a recursive equation, but in this case, it's finite, so maybe it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) So, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))).\n\nSo, each time, there's a 1 + 3(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the outermost parentheses would be 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost is 3*(result of the inner expression). So, if the inner expression evaluates to 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because in my counting, I went from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous). So, Layer 9 is 29524, which is the result inside the outermost parentheses. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9, which would be 3*29524.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because when I compute Layer 9, it's already the result inside the outermost parentheses, so the entire expression is 3 times that.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, I compute each layer step by step.\n\nSo, as I did earlier, Layer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, so 3*29524.\n\nWait, but wait a second, that doesn't seem right because when I compute each layer, I'm already including the 1 + 3*(...), so the outermost parentheses would be Layer 9, and then the 3 is multiplied by that. So, yes, the total would be 3*29524.\n\nBut let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 *3 can be broken down as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12= 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Did I make a mistake in the number of layers? Because when I count the number of 1+3(...), there are nine instances, right? So, from the innermost to the outermost, I have nine layers, each time computing 1 +3*(previous). So, the outermost is Layer 9, which is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't skip any or count incorrectly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, the outermost is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas.\n\nLet me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost expression as x1 = 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThen, x2=1 +3x1=1+12=13\n\nx3=1 +3x2=1 +39=40\n\nx4=1 +3x3=1 +120=121\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, each x_{n} = 1 +3x_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nIn general, for such a recurrence, the solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is: x_n = 3x_{n-1} +1, with x_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is x_n -3x_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is x^{(h)}_n = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution x^{(p)}_n = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3A +1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is x_n = C*3^n -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition x_1=4.\n\nAt n=1: x_1= C*3^1 -1/2 =3C -1/2=4\n\nSo, 3C=4 +1/2=9/2\n\nThus, C= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is x_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2\n\nSimplify: x_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, x_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, x_9= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, x_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*x_9=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Because sometimes when you have expressions like this, it's easy to miscount the number of iterations.\n\nIn the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time you have 1 +3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1 +3(\" introduces another layer, and the closing parentheses come after each. So, how many times does \"1 +3(\" appear?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"1 +3(\" after the initial 3, I can see that it's 9 times. So, that's 9 layers, each time adding another 1 +3(...). So, n=9, which gives x_9=29524, and then 3*x_9=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 +3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. But in this case, it's finite, so it's more of a finite geometric series.\n\nWait, but the formula I used earlier with the recurrence relation seems to have worked, giving me x_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, with n=9, x_9= (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*x_9=88572.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nLet me just confirm with another approach, perhaps expanding the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, each term is 1 +3*(previous), which is a linear recurrence, not a geometric series, but the solution ends up being a geometric progression.\n\nBut since I've already confirmed it using the recurrence relation and step-by-step computation, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it using the formula x_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, x_9= (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*x_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've checked it thoroughly, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Let me parse it again. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by a big parenthesis. Inside that parenthesis, it's 1 plus 3 times another parenthesis, which itself contains 1 plus 3 times another, and so on. So, perhaps it's better to think of each layer as being 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I can compute the innermost layer first and then work my way out, that might work. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Because after that, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, let me compute that first. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, the layer just outside that would be 1 + 3*(result of innermost layer). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2: 13. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3: 40. Next, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 364*3. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Next, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Then, 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3 again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1+1092=1093. Correct. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1+3279=3280. Correct. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000+840=9840. Then, 1+9840=9841. Correct. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1+29523=29524. Correct. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed and used in the next layer. After computing all layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. **Final Computation:**\n    - Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me check how many layers there are. The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Let's see: Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3.\n2. Then, moving outward, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3).\n3. Next, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n4. And this continues until the outermost layer, which is 1 + 3*(...). Hmm, so actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps I should compute each layer starting from the innermost and work my way outwards. Let me try that approach. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9). So, the total value would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000*3 = 27000. Wait, no, that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, but perhaps it's easier to compute directly.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly. Let me list them again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*L9 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1092 +1=1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, plus 240=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, plus 120=29520, plus 3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. As calculated earlier, that's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because it's crucial.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nEach time, we add another layer. Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression: it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many 1+3 are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(1 + 3.\n\nEach time, a new layer is added. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost 1 + 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3, then each next layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the expression, from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(1 + 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1 + 3 is followed by another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears as a separate term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think that each layer corresponds to a level of nesting. So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers because each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), and the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, after the first 3*, there are 8 more layers of 1 + 3*(...). Wait, no, because the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3 terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. ... and so on, until the 9th layer.\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I had L1 to L9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps there are 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3*(...), starting from L1 = 1 + 3, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, etc., up to L9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L9), which is what I computed as 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me recount the number of layers. Let me write out the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my earlier computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p.\n\nSolving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*L9, and L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total value is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it.\n\nTherefore, without computing each layer, we can use the formula to find that the total is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me see if I can apply this formula directly.\n\nGiven that L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, 3^{10} is 59049, so L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*L9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, the outermost expression is 3*L9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me check again. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by another expression), and that expression is similar. So, maybe each layer is actually an expression of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards. Let me try that approach. Let me write down each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, the final step would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, yes, 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from Layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Wait, no, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, as we did before. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each term is following a pattern similar to a geometric series, but with a twist because of the +1 each time. Let me see if I can find a general formula for an in terms of n. Let's define a recursive relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 4, a_2 is 13, a_3 is 40, etc. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from a1 up to a9. So, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent with our step-by-step calculation. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that each layer \\( a_n \\) can be represented as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula for \\( n = 9 \\) gives \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Finally, multiplying by the outermost factor of 3 yields the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me check again. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by another expression). So, perhaps I should consider each multiplication by 3 as part of each layer. Let me try to outline the layers properly. Maybe it's better to work from the inside out, computing each inner expression first and then substituting back into the outer ones. Let me try that approach. So, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result), which is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nWait, but I'm noticing that each time I compute a layer, I'm getting a result, and then the next layer is 1 + 3 times that result. So, perhaps I can keep track of each layer's value as I move outward.\n\nLet me list the layers step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and inside the parentheses is up to Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, carryover 1\n- 2*3=6 +1=7\n- 5*3=15, carryover 1\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2\n- 2*3=6 +2=8\n- 9*3=27, carryover 2\nWait, no, that might not be the right way. Maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 step by step.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4*3=12, write down 2 and carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\nNext digit: 5*3=15, write down 5 and carryover 1.\nNext digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carryover 2.\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nFinally, the digit before that: 9*3=27, but wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so 2 is the ten thousands place, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, 4 units. So when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might have miscalculated.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me check again because the original expression has nine layers, but when I started labeling, I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, let's see: The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, so starting from the innermost, how many are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a \"1+3(...)\", so let's count:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times \"1+3(...)\" occurs. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, inside the first 3(...), there are eight more \"1+3(...)\" terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have a \"1+3(...)\" inside another \"1+3(...)\".\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), inside it is 1+3(...), which is the first layer. Then inside that is another 1+3(...), which is the second layer, and so on until the innermost.\n\nWait, let me try to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n10. 1 + 3\nThen it starts closing from there.\n\nWait, so actually, the innermost is the 10th opening parenthesis, but that seems too many. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to see that each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is the first layer. Then inside that, another (1+3(...)), which is the second layer, and so on until we reach the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, and the innermost is 1+3 without any further nesting. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. That seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's the solution. I worked through each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, computing each layer's value based on the previous one. Each time, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1, which seems to follow a pattern similar to a geometric series, but since each term is dependent on the previous one, it's more of a recursive computation.\n\nI didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, as I double-checked each layer, and the final multiplication by 3 also checked out. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9:  \n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572  \n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me check again. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (another expression)). So maybe each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps it's better to think of it as a recursive expression where each term depends on the next. Let me think of it as a function. Let's define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). But wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(f(n)), where f(n) is 1 + 3*f(n-1). Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me list each layer as I compute them. Let's start by computing the innermost part first. The innermost expression is the last one: 1 + 3. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2: 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). That's 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 41*3=123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), starting from f(1) = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for f(n). The recurrence relation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1, with f(1) = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is f_h(n) = 3*f_h(n-1), which has the solution f_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say f_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have n=9 layers, so f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value we got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute f(9) directly, which might have been faster, especially if there were more layers. But since there were only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I think I'm confident that the answer is correct. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. 3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3 to get the final answer. 4. Alternatively, use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula and compute directly. Either way, the result is the same. So, I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me try to parse the expression correctly. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) occurs. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each time it's 1 + 3*(something). So, perhaps there are eight 3*(...) terms, with the innermost being 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adding another 3*(...) around it. Let me try to write each layer step by step. Let's define each layer as follows: Let me denote L1 as the innermost expression: L1 = 1 + 3 Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 Then the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, but let me check the original problem again. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there's 1 + 3, then each time it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each time, it's 1 + 3*(Layer n), so each Layer n+1 = 1 + 3*Layer n. Let me count the number of layers. The expression has 8 sets of parentheses after the initial 3*(...). Wait, no: let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, after the first 3*(, there's a 1 + 3*(...), which is another layer. So, let's count the number of opening parentheses: Each \"1 + 3*(...\" starts a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each time you go out one layer, you add another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1 + 3*(...) occurs, which is 8 times, because after the initial 3*(..., there are 8 more layers. Wait, let me check that again. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears in the expression. The entire expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first \"1+3(\", that's the first layer. Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count: 1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n\nSo, there are 8 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1), up to Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer8). Wait, but in the original problem, after the initial 3*(, there are 8 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\", so Layer1 to Layer8, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). Therefore, the total expression is 3*(Layer8). So, to compute this, I can compute each Layer from 1 to 8, then multiply the result by 3. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer8) = 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*9841.\n\nCalculating 3*9841:\n\nFirst, 9841 * 3:\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 800 = 2400\n\n3 * 40 = 120\n\n3 * 1 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 29523.\n\nWait a second, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with multiple layers.\n\nStarting with Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Correct.\n\nSo, each step checks out, and the final result is 29523.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Since each layer is defined as Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for Ln.\n\nThe recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, we can write the recurrence as Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer8, which is L8 = (3^9 -1)/2=9841.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*L8=3*9841=29523.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^9 -1)/2= (3^10 -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -3=59046, then 59046/2=29523. Correct.\n\nSo, another way to compute it is 3^10 is 59049, subtract 3 to get 59046, then divide by 2 to get 29523.\n\nBut since I already computed it step by step, and verified with the formula, I'm confident that 29523 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, 3*(3^9 -1)/2=3*9841=29523.\n\nAlternatively, 3*(3^9)=3^10=59049, then 3*(3^9 -1)/2=(3^10 -3)/2=59049-3=59046, 59046/2=29523.\n\nEither way, same result.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 29523.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1, I can build up to Layer 9 and then multiply by 3 at the end. That seems manageable. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's see. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (20 * 3) + (4 * 3)\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSeems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern or formula that could simplify this process. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series, but I'm not sure. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then the sequence is defined recursively. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4,\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n \u2265 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, let's find the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula holds for each layer. So, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524 as we calculated earlier.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147\n\nTherefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result as before. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n------------\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, breaking it down:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60,000 +27,000=87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYep, that's consistent.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nSo, let's start with the innermost expression:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the total would be 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in my calculations. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1+1092=1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1+3279=3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1+9840=9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nNow, the outermost operation is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let's compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Each time I see a '(...))', that's a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is layer 1.\n\nThen 1+3(layer1) is layer2.\n\nThen 1+3(layer2) is layer3.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3(, there are 8 more (1+3(...)) terms, each nested inside the previous. So, from layer1 to layer9, each time adding another layer. So, yes, 9 layers, with the outermost being 3*(layer9).\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me try an alternative approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from layer1=4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWe can compute each term step by step as I did before, but perhaps there's a formula for the nth term of such a recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where B is a constant. Let me try to find the closed-form solution.\n\nFirst, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say B. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, matches layer1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, layer2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, layer9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of times the pattern (1+3(...) occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is layer1.\n\nThen, each time you go outward, you add another layer. So, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more '1+3*(...)' until you reach the outermost layer, which is the 9th. So, yes, layer9 is the outermost, and the total is 3*layer9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum that can be expressed using the formula for a geometric series, given the recurrence relation.\n\nWait, but since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have a closed-form expression, maybe I can compute the total expression directly using the formula.\n\nSince the outermost operation is 3*layer9, and layer9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*layer9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer n is given by (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. The outermost layer is the 9th, and the total expression is 3 times this value. Calculating this gives 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me check again. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)). So, each layer is multiplied by 3 after the addition. Maybe I should think of each layer as a term that's being multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me write down each layer and compute its value. Starting with the innermost one: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Let me verify 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.

Let me try to parse it correctly. Maybe it's better to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let's see: The innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on, until the outermost layer. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right?

Let me recount the number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2.

So then the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a calculation mistake. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39. 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120. 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: Let's compute 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then 3*29524: Let's compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Let me think. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote a_n as the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by expanding each layer step by step and by solving the recurrence relation, which gave me the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Let me see: The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (...))). So, perhaps it's better to think of it as each layer being multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Let me write down each layer as I compute it.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nThat's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4.\n\nSo, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is:\n\n1 + 3(Layer 1)\nWhich is 1 + 3*4.\n\n3 times 4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nSo, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3:\n\n1 + 3(Layer 2)\nWhich is 1 + 3*13.\n\n3 times 13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nLayer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4:\n\n1 + 3(Layer 3)\nWhich is 1 + 3*40.\n\n3 times 40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121.\n\nLayer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5:\n\n1 + 3(Layer 4)\nWhich is 1 + 3*121.\n\n3 times 121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364.\n\nLayer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6:\n\n1 + 3(Layer 5)\nWhich is 1 + 3*364.\n\n3 times 364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nLayer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7:\n\n1 + 3(Layer 6)\nWhich is 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3 times 1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nLayer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8:\n\n1 + 3(Layer 7)\nWhich is 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3 times 3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nLayer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9:\n\n1 + 3(Layer 8)\nWhich is 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3 times 9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nLayer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 3*29000 is 87000.\n\nThen, 3*524 is 1572.\n\nAdding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 times 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again quickly to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, I just realized that when I first started, I thought there were nine layers, but maybe I miscounted. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to make sure.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...)) is a layer. So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first 3 is outside.\n- Then, each (1+3(...) is a layer. So, from the first (1+3, how many are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. Each time, another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet's count the number of times 1+3 appears inside the parentheses.\n\nStarting from the first (1+3, then each subsequent (1+3 is nested inside. Let me see:\n\n- The first (1+3 is layer 1.\n- Then, each subsequent (1+3 is layer 2, 3, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of (1+3(...) expressions. Let me see:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, there's (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach (1+3 adds another layer. So, from the initial 3(1+3(...)), each (1+3 adds a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each time we have a (1+3(...)), and there are 9 of them.\n\nWait, let me try to count the number of opening parentheses in the expression.\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...)):\n\n- The first ( is after 3(1+3\n- Then, each (1+3 adds another (.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each time we have a (1+3, and the expression ends with 1+3), so there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each time we have a (1+3(...)), which is a layer, and there are 8 layers because the innermost is just 1+3, then each layer adds another.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the expression as a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, if I compute a_1 through a_9, then the total is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let me compute each a_n step by step.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent with my previous calculation. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication at any step. Let me go through each a_n again quickly.\n\na_1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3*a_9: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the recurrence relation.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, that would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and this pattern repeats nine times. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the total would be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to slip up.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364 * 3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.

Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 * 29524. As before, 29524 *3. Let me compute it again to confirm:\n- 20000 *3=60000\n- 9000*3=27000\n- 500*3=1500\n- 20*3=60\n- 4*3=12\nAdding them up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer), it's similar to a geometric series. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see.\n\nIn general, for such a recurrence relation, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it's a non-homogeneous one because of the constant term 1. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation would be L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A =1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 =4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same result without having to compute each layer manually. That's more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check the formula again. Since each L_n is defined as 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and we found L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, let's verify for n=5:\n\nL_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Which matches my earlier calculation. Perfect.\n\nSo, this formula is reliable. Therefore, I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which can be seen as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, plus an additional 1.\n\nBut in this case, since the expression is finite (nine layers), the formula we derived using the recurrence relation is more straightforward.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here. I computed each layer step by step, verified each result, then derived a general formula to compute the nth layer, applied it to the 9th layer, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. I also double-checked each step to ensure there were no arithmetic errors. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, each layer \\( L_n \\) is given by \\( (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 \\). Applying this formula to the ninth layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next term}) \\), repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1) and moving outward, compute each layer using the formula \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\).\n\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **General Formula:**\n   Recognize the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).

    "text": " Let me parse it again. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. So, maybe it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way out. So, let's define each layer as follows: Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2. And so on, until L9 = 1 + 3*L8. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from L1. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Maybe I miscalculated one of the layers. Let me go back step by step.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, L9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3.\n\nLet me break it down digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's what I got before. Hmm. So, is 88572 the correct answer? Let me check with another method to be sure. Maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers.\n\nLooking at the structure of the expression, it's a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about how to model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is of the form a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers (from L1 to L9), let's compute a_9.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Good, so that's consistent.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we calculated before.\n\nWait, but let me check: is the expression 3*(a_9) or is a_9 already the outermost layer? Let me see the original problem again: 3(1+3(1+3(...))). So, yes, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is a_9. So, yes, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, we can express the entire expression as 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem using both methods and see if they match.\n\nFor example, let's take a smaller version with just two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute step by step: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39.\n\nUsing the formula: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Then, 3*a_2=39. Correct.\n\nAnother test: three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))).\n\nCompute step by step: Innermost: 1 + 3=4. Then, 1 + 3*4=13. Then, 1 + 3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120.\n\nUsing the formula: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Then, 3*a_3=120. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer \\( L_i \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer and \\( L_9 \\) is the outermost layer. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so there are nine such layers. So, maybe I should consider each layer as a step where I compute the innermost expression first and then work my way out. Let me try that. Let me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me start computing each layer one by one.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple. Layer 1 is 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in multiplication somewhere. Let me verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the final step: 3*29524.

So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method, like recognizing a pattern or using a formula for a geometric series. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, using this formula, I can compute a_9 directly without having to compute each layer step by step, which would save time, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(29524) = 88,572, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Let's see:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177,147.\n\nSo, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, that matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, another way to compute this is to recognize that the entire expression can be written as (3^{11} - 3)/2, which equals 88,572.\n\nThat's a neat formula, and it's good to know that both methods lead to the same result. It also shows that recognizing patterns and using recurrence relations can simplify the problem-solving process, especially for more complex or nested expressions.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified my answer using two different methods: step-by-step computation and using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. Both methods led me to the same conclusion, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\) and each subsequent layer is computed as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The entire expression is then \\( 3 \\times \\) Layer 9:\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nWe also verified using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, confirming the result.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me count the number of layers. Each time there's a 3 multiplied by a (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each next layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. So actually, there are nine 1 + 3 terms, each nested inside the previous one, and then each of these is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So maybe there are nine layers in total, each being 1 + 3*(inner layer). Let me try to parse it correctly. Let me write it step by step, starting from the innermost. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo,\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen,\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nUp to L9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(L9). Because the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each next layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, actually, the innermost is L1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, to compute this, I need to compute each layer from L1 to L9, then multiply the result by 3.\n\nLet me start computing each layer step by step.\n\nFirst, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9, so 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_k^h = C*3^{k}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_k^p = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_k = C*3^{k} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer k, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor k=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nk=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nk=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nk=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nk=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nk=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nk=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nk=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nk=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3*L9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(inner expression). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me check again. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, perhaps each layer is multiplied by 3, except the innermost one, which is just 1 + 3. Let me try to compute the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let's start with the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, Layer 2: 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 3: 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 4: 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 5: 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 6: 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093: Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 7: 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 8: 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nLayer 9: 29524.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.

Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, so that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without manually computing each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something similar, but in this case, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), so it's a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps it can be solved in a closed-form, but since the number of layers is finite (nine), it's easier to compute each term step by step as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to compute a larger number of layers, I might look for a pattern or a formula.\n\nLet me see if I can find a pattern in the a_n terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 13\n\na_3 = 40\n\na_4 = 121\n\na_5 = 364\n\na_6 = 1093\n\na_7 = 3280\n\na_8 = 9841\n\na_9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nP = 3*P +1\n\nSolving for P:\n\nP - 3P = 1 => -2P =1 => P= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nThus, for our problem, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.

    "text": " Let me check again. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times something). So, perhaps the innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that might be a better way to think about it. So, let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me compute that: 364 * 3. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me compute that: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let's compute that: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. 5*3 is 15, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. 3*3 is 9. So writing it out: 88572. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer builds upon the previous one, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This seems like a geometric progression, maybe? Let me see if there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_0 + c/(1 - k)) * k^n - c/(1 - k), provided that k \u2260 1. In this case, k is 3 and c is 1. Let me check that.\n\nWait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, where C is a constant. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1. a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches what I got earlier. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct again. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So that confirms the answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Then, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524: let's compute that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the other formula: 3^{11} is 177147. 177147 -3 is 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So, same result.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've computed each layer step by step, verified the result using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and double-checked the calculations to ensure there are no arithmetic errors. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me parse the expression again. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by another expression). So, the structure is: 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, maybe each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Hmm, perhaps I should approach it by starting from the innermost layer and work my way out. Let me try that. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. Let's call that Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Now, moving one layer out, we have Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do this step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 3*3 = 9. Wait, no, actually, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Wait, but let me check that again because 29524*3. Let me compute it another way to be sure.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just verify that I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me check a couple of layers to make sure I didn't miscalculate. For example, Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems to be the correct result.

So, the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), etc., up to Layer 9. But actually, looking at the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer wraps another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that.

So, 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems like a big number. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, but wait a second. I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each \"1+\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me confirm by writing them out:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer, which is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, so when I computed up to Layer 9, that was the 9th layer, and then I multiplied by 3. So, the total computation is correct. So, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let's see, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as I computed before. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found using the method for linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside. Wait, actually, when I numbered the layers, I had Layer 1 as the innermost, so the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would correspond to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, which matches my earlier computation. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we find the value before the final multiplication by 3 is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me think again. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ( ... )). So, maybe each layer is multiplied by 3. Let me try to parse it step by step. Let me start by evaluating the innermost parentheses first. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that's Layer 2. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's a jump. Layer 3 is 40. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final step is to multiply this by 3. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number. Let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve the recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me check: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ...))). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: 1 + 3. Then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1), etc., up to layer9, which is the innermost part of the outermost multiplication. So, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9). So, layer9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively computing each layer, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me parse the structure again. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, maybe each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps it's better to think of it as a recursive structure, where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. Let me try to write this out step by step, starting from the innermost part. Let me define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s denote Layer 1 as the innermost part: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) And so on, until Layer 9. But wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, maybe I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, each time substituting the previous layer's value into the next. Let me try that. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each layer seems to be growing by a factor of 3 each time, plus 1. Let me check Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula for such a nested expression. The structure seems similar to a geometric series, but with a twist because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, we can write a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing manually. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm 3*29524. Let me compute it again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: The entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it step by step, and also derived a formula to compute it more efficiently, which gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let's compute that step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\nThen, 9000*3 = 27000\nNext, 500*3 = 1500\nThen, 24*3 = 72\nNow, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high.

That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524*3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 (write down 2, carry over 1)\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15 (write down 5, carry over 1)\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 (write down 8, carry over 2)\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo writing it out: 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning now.
