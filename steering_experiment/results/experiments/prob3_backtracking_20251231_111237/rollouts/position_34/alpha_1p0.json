    "text": " Let me check again. The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that. So, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 3*29,524 = 3*(20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24) = 3*20,000 + 3*9,000 + 3*500 + 3*24 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 72 = Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the total is 88,572. Wait, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3*29,524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3 = 60,000; 9,000*3 = 27,000; 500*3 = 1,500; 24*3 = 72. Adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to compute each layer step by step, which would be more efficient, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps, using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, to find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in the original problem, we have nine layers. Wait, let me count the number of layers again. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(...\" is a layer. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1, then the next is layer 2, up to layer 9. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times a_9, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572, as I calculated earlier. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to go through each layer, which is much more efficient. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponentiation. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2,187, 3^8 is 6,561, 3^9 is 19,683, and 3^10 is 59,049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59,049, and subtracting 1 gives 59,048, which divided by 2 is 29,524. Multiply that by 3, and we get 88,572. Yep, that's solid. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can determine the value efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This forms a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let a_n represent the value of the nth layer. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **General Solution**: Solving the recurrence, we find a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute for n=9**: Since there are 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 29,524.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: Multiply by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " Let me check the structure again. The original problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. But wait, let me check again because sometimes when you carry over, it's easy to make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500+72=1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I counted the layers correctly. I started from Layer 1 as 1+3, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3. Let me count how many layers there are in the original expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each (1+3(...)) is a layer. Let's see: Each time, it's 1+3(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The entire expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let's see: The innermost is (1+3). Then each layer wraps around that. Let's count the number of layers by counting the number of (1+3(...)) expressions. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then 1+3(Layer1) is Layer2. Then 1+3(Layer2) is Layer3. Continuing up to Layer9, because there are nine sets of (1+3(...)) after the initial 3. So, yes, Layer9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, computing up to Layer9 and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. So, as I computed earlier, Layer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Let me just verify each step once more to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting with Layer1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step and then multiply the final result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**:  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524.

Let me try adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = Let's add 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, perhaps I can look for a pattern or formula that might represent this expression more generally. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me think about that.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Let me check that.\n\nWait, actually, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1. But according to the formula, a_1 should be (3^{1+1} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches our earlier calculation. Good.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula works.\n\nThus, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing one more layer manually. Let's compute Layer 5 again.\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to compute 3*(1 + 3*(...)) multiple times is to recognize that each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost 3, each step is 3*previous +1.\n\nWait, but actually, each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then moving outwards.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found earlier, which gives the value at each layer n.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost is a_9, which is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's solid. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me check that multiplication again. 29524 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit: 29524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss any layers.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it properly. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check this because the numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication. Let me try multiplying 29524 by 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are right. Each layer builds upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like a geometric progression but each term is defined recursively. Alternatively, I could model this as a recurrence relation. Let me think about that for a moment. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let me try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, substituting into the general solution: a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3 + B = 4. And for n=2: a_2 = A*3^{2} + B = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substituting A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since in our problem, we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method confirms the result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplying the previous term by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent term is 3 times the previous plus 1. But since I've already derived a formula for a_n, I can use that to compute the result without having to iterate each layer, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually, as I did earlier. I think I've covered all the steps and verified my calculations multiple times. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=0, if we consider the base case, perhaps a_0 = 1, but let's check. Wait, in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So, maybe the general term starts at n=1. Let me set up the equations. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, after computing Layer 9, which is the innermost part, each layer wraps around, and the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's see. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that seems off because 29524*3 should be 88572. Let me verify that multiplication another way. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. I think I did that correctly. Each layer was computed by multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and adding 1. So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the sequence goes 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Let me check one of the layers again to make sure. Let's take Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4. Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121=363, plus 1 is 364. That's correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems accurate. I think I've got it right.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. It might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, let's find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 (since there are 9 layers), L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for the homogeneous part, the solution is A*3^n. To find the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems valid. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid.

Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition: When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, since Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, another way to compute the answer is using this formula. But either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, the result is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked my work, and everything seems consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we derive a closed-form formula and confirm the result through both iterative computation and the formula. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern, perhaps a geometric series or something similar, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since there are nine layers, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier, but computing each layer step by step was manageable. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an error with so many layers. Let me verify each layer step by step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's see. The recursive formula is: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me recall how to solve such recursions. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, in this case, the recurrence is Layer n = 3*Layer n-1 + 1. So, c = 3, d = 1. Let me confirm. So, the homogeneous solution is Layer n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution Layer n^p = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, Layer 1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 /2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = 81 -1 /2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, since Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*Layer 9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a couple more layers using the closed-form formula to see if it holds. For example, Layer 4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Correct. Layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 =728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula is consistent. Therefore, using this formula, I can compute any layer without having to compute all the previous ones, which is helpful. But in this case, since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually was manageable, but it's good to know the formula in case the number of layers is larger. Alternatively, another way to approach this problem is by recognizing that each time you have 1 + 3*(something), which is similar to a geometric series. Let me think about that. If I expand the expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to the sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. However, in this case, it's not a simple geometric series because each term is nested inside the previous one. But maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum. Let me try to expand it. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me denote the innermost expression as E1 = 1 + 3. Then, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 88572. So, this is the same as before. Alternatively, if I think of each E_n as 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1=4, then E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. As I found earlier, the closed-form is E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and 3*E9 = 88572. So, all methods point to the same answer. Just to make sure, let me try to compute E9 using the closed-form formula and then multiply by 3. 3^{10} is 59049, so E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*29524 =88572. Perfect, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. For example, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each 1 inside contributes a certain amount based on how many times it's multiplied by 3. Let me try to see how that works. Let's denote the entire expression as S. So, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. If I expand it, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). Wait, that's the same as the original problem. Alternatively, maybe I can write S as 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with one fewer layer. Let me see. Let me denote the inner expression as T, which has 8 layers. Then, S = 3*(1 + 3*T). But T itself is 3*(1 + 3*(... )) with 8 layers. Wait, this might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as S = 3 + 9*T, where T is the next layer. But I'm not sure if this approach simplifies things. It might be better to stick with the recursive formula or the closed-form solution. Another idea: since each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, and the previous layer is 1 + 3*the one before, and so on, this is a linear recursion that can be solved as I did before. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with the closed-form formula, and ensuring that each step is correct, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}$.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can express the entire original expression using the formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it thoroughly, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as \\(\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the 9th layer, this gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29000*3=87000, 524*3=1572, so 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result should be 88,572.

Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my answer is right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way, perhaps using a different approach, maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the original expression has 9 layers, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula lead me to the same answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, is 29524.

So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29,000 is 87,000, and 3*524 is 1,572. So adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Wait, but let me verify that multiplication to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. That seems correct. So, putting it all together: Starting from the innermost Layer 1 as 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), up to Layer 9 being 29,524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572. Let me just recap the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Wait, but let me check Layer 7 again because 3*1093 is 3279, and adding 1 gives 3280, which is correct. Then Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Then 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that could have saved me from computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is calculated using that recursion. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Simplifying: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, that's the answer. I think this confirms that the step-by-step computation is correct. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula might have saved time, especially if there were more layers, but for nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I just need to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes along the way. Let me quickly recap the layers again to spot any errors: Layer 1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524.

Let me compute it step by step: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, that gives me 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 30,000 *3 =90,000, then subtract 476*3=1,428, so 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Hmm, but that seems a bit off because 29,524 is less than 30,000, so 3*29,524 should be 88,572. Let me verify with another method. 29,524 *3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake in the general solution. Let me derive it properly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r-3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3B +1 => B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula is a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, so a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59,049. So, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and finally multiply the outermost layer by 3. Using the recurrence relation approach, we determine that the value of the outermost layer is 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.

Hmm, that seems right, but let me check the multiplication again just to be sure. 29,524 * 3: Let's do it digit by digit. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. So, writing it out: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my calculation is right. I started from the innermost parentheses and worked my way out, computing each layer step by step.

But now, with 10 layers, Layer10 is 88573, and then 3*88573=265,719.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused because I'm getting two different answers depending on how I count the layers.

Let me check.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(...). So, that would mean 9 layers, right? Because the initial 3(...) is the first layer, then each \"1+3(\" adds another.\n\nWait, no, the initial 3(...) is the outermost layer, which is Layer10 in my previous counting. Wait, no, perhaps the initial 3(...) is the outermost expression, which is 3 times Layer9.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to visualize the structure.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(A), where A is:\n\nA = 1 + 3*(B), where B is:\n\nB = 1 + 3*(C), where C is:\n\nC = 1 + 3*(D), and so on, until the innermost D is (1+3).\n\nSo, each time, we have a new layer. Let's count how many times we have \"1 + 3*\".\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1+3) \u2192 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) \u2192 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) \u2192 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) \u2192 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) \u2192 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) \u2192 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) \u2192 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) \u2192 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) \u2192 29524\n\nLayer10: 1 + 3*(Layer9) \u2192 88573\n\nBut in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(Layer10), so the total would be 3*88573=265,719.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the innermost was Layer1, then each subsequent layer up to Layer9, and then multiplied by 3. But now, I'm getting 10 layers, with the outermost being 3*(Layer10).\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the original expression. Each \"1+3(\" starts a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3(, there are 9 \"1+3(\" instances before the final closing parenthesis. So, that would mean 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, the initial 3(...) is Layer10, and the innermost is Layer1.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the initial 3(...) is just 3 times something, which is Layer10.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the initial 3(...) is the outermost expression, which is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 is 29524, leading to 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut when I computed Layer10 as 88573, that would mean the outermost expression is 3*88573=265,719. But that seems too large.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to write the expression with the layers properly.\n\nLet me define each layer step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: (1 + 3*Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: (1 + 3*Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: (1 + 3*Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: (1 + 3*Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: (1 + 3*Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: (1 + 3*Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3*Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that makes sense because in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), where ... is the result of 9 layers of 1+3*(...). So, Layer9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nEarlier, when I thought there were 10 layers, that was incorrect because the initial 3*(...) is not another layer of 1+3*(...), it's just 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, the inner expression is 9 layers deep, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by computing each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed and used in the next layer. After computing all nine layers, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

Yes, that's the same result. So, 3*29,524 =88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Starting from Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.

Then, 3*29524=88,572. Yes, that seems accurate. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence, and it can be solved as follows. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B =1 +3*B => B -3B=1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Wait, but in our earlier computation, Layer1 was a_1=4, which corresponds to n=1. So, a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer9=29,524. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. Just to double-check, maybe I can compute a few layers using the closed-form formula to see if they match. For example, a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct. a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. a_4=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, using the formula for a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2=29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. I think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Okay, so I was right the first time. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.

I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute step by step. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3B \u21d2 B - 3B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n goes from 1 to 9. The outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nCompute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrived at the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3, so the total expression can be seen as a sum of a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nThe expression inside the outermost 3 is: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nThis can be written as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), which is similar to the sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, but actually, it's a bit different because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, no, actually, it's more like each term is 1 + 3 times the next term, which is similar to the recurrence we had before.\n\nBut since we've already solved it using the recurrence relation, maybe that's the most straightforward way.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead me to the same result. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this using the recurrence relation method, we determine that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let's see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. Let me write down the recursive formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1) with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general form of a linear recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r is the common ratio and c is the constant term. In this case, r = 3 and c = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is given by a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}. The particular solution is a constant, a_n^p = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: Layer 1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, the result is 3*((3^{10} - 1)/2) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That matches my earlier manual calculation. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} step by step: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 3^11 = 177147 Yes, that's correct. So, 3^{11} is indeed 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3) = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives (3^{11} -3)/2, which is 88572. Either way, the result is the same. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems pretty big. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Let me check that multiplication: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Same result. So, my calculations seem correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, in case I made an arithmetic mistake somewhere. Let's see: Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. Plug n=1 into the general solution: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula confirms my previous result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, so is that the final answer? Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me go through each layer again to verify.

Each time I'm adding 1 and multiplying by 3, it's growing exponentially. So, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me try to find a pattern or a recursive formula. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n... and so on.\n\nI can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. The standard approach for such a linear recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation of order 1. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_h = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, we need a particular solution, a_p. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_h + a_p = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. From Layer 1: a_1 = 4\n\nSo, when n = 1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works. So, now, instead of computing each layer step by step, I can use this formula to find a_9 directly.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The general solution was a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each layer as building up the expression, and each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*previous, which leads to a geometric progression.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is a term in a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nStarting from the innermost term, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, the entire expression can be seen as a sum of a geometric series with ratio 3.\n\nWait, let me try to write the entire expression as a sum.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to expand this step by step, but that might be too tedious. Alternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, which seems to work perfectly, so I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n--------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3*29,524 as 3*(30,000 - 476) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That matches.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations or reasoning. I used two methods: step-by-step computation and deriving a formula using recurrence relations, and both gave me the same result.

By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern described by the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula for the 9th layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Layer 1 = 4 Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, the general formula for Layer n is: Layer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1). This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is solving Layer n = 3 * Layer (n-1), which has the solution Layer n = C * 3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = C * 3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition Layer 1 = 4: 4 = C * 3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, that's a more efficient way to compute it using the formula. But since the problem had only 9 layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad, but for more layers, the formula would be better. Anyway, so the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of this progression, we determine that the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me do that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6, write down 6. So putting it all together, 3*29524=88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nFinally, 2 * 3 = 6, write 6.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just verify with another method. Alternatively, I can break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Then multiply each by 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier in computing the layers, let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each step checks out. I think I did this correctly. Another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or perhaps find a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a and b are constants. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, L_1 = 4, so L_0 would be the term before that, which would be 1 + 3*(L_0) = L_1. Let me see. If I rearrange the recurrence, L_n - a*L_{n-1} = b. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*a^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a). So the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + K. Applying initial conditions: At n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*a^1 + K = C*3 + K. Also, K = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. So, 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n + (-1/2). Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 =81 -1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is layer 9, is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as I computed earlier. So, using both iterative computation and the formula from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be absolutely sure, let me verify the final multiplication once more. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, write down 6.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom to top: 6, 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that's 688572? Wait, no, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572, not 688572. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write it properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x        3\n   ------------\n     8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, that would be 88572. Let me write it out:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. So, write 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked all the steps, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step and then applying the final multiplication by 3, the solution is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me do this step by step. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the total is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me go back through each layer to verify.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524. As before, 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; +1,500=88,500; +72=88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the answer. To make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's easier to solve the recurrence relation directly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard method is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to go through each layer. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. It's good to recognize the pattern and apply the formula instead of computing each step manually. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a repeating pattern and using a formula derived from a recurrence relation.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\).

Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n, which could then be used to compute a_9 without computing each step. Let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, the formula works. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct, and using the recurrence relation formula also leads to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By calculating each layer step by step and then multiplying the final layer by 3, we arrive at the solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). The innermost term is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer wraps around the previous one.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n   - **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n   - **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n   - **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me do that multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because the numbers are growing quite rapidly. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1=4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step builds on the previous one correctly, and the recurrence relation approach confirms the result. So, yeah, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. After computing all layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. The step-by-step evaluation confirms that the final value is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go back and check each layer again to ensure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting over, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, that should be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence, and maybe I can find a closed-form solution for it.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r = 3 and c = 1 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_0)*(r^n). But wait, actually, that formula is for a homogeneous recurrence, but here we have a nonhomogeneous term. Let me recall the formula correctly.\n\nFor a recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is:\n\na_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_0)*(r^n)\n\nBut in our case, r = 3, so 1 - r = -2, so c/(1 - r) = 1/(-2) = -1/2.\n\nBut wait, our initial condition is a_1 = 4, right? Because Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but if I'm using the formula, I should define a_0 as the first term. Let me check.\n\nIf I let a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is Layer 2.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, which is Layer 3.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nUsing the formula for such a recurrence, the solution is:\n\na_n = (c/(1 - r)) + a_1*(r)^{n-1}\n\nWait, because the general solution is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1)*(r)^{n-1}\n\nIn our case, c = 1, r = 3, so a_n = (1/(1 - 3)) + 4*(3)^{n-1} = (-1/2) + 4*(3)^{n-1}\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (-1/2) + 4*(3)^{8}\n\nBecause n = 9, so exponent is 8.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (-1/2) + 4*6561 = (-0.5) + 26244 = 26243.5\n\nWait, that's 26243.5, but earlier when I computed step by step, I got Layer 9 as 29524. That's a discrepancy. So, something is wrong here. Let me check my application of the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recall the correct approach for solving the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nAh, okay, that matches the step-by-step computation I did earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me verify the formula again. The general solution for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Plugging n=1, we get (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2, (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3, (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is Layer 3. So, the formula works correctly.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. After computing all layers, we multiply the outermost result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering how each layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1, it's possible. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\nNow, equate both sides:\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\nB = 1 + 3B\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n-2B = 1\nSo, B = -1/2\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\nSolve for A:\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1:\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct.\nFor n=2:\na_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct.\nn=3:\na_3 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct.\nn=4:\na_4 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121, correct.\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer goes up to Layer 9, which would be a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula:\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, so 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2 = 59049. Subtracting 1 gives 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that step by step:\n29524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\nFinally, 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Using the formula for such a recurrence, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we compute a_9 and then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. **Compute each layer from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9)**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"
