So, the final step is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 29524*3=88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, that gives 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier computations because that would throw off the entire result. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, correct. Hmm, seems like all the steps check out. So, I think I did this correctly. I just need to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of layers again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, starting from the innermost. Let's count the opening parentheses: There's one at each \"(\", so starting from the innermost, the first is at 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another. Let me count the number of layers by the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let me see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, moving out, each time there's a 1 + 3(, that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 1+3(1+3(...))\n2. 1+3(1+3(...))\n3. 1+3(1+3(...))\n4. 1+3(1+3(...))\n5. 1+3(1+3(...))\n6. 1+3(1+3(...))\n7. 1+3(1+3(...))\n8. 1+3(1+3(...))\n9. 1+3(1+3(...))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3(...). So, my earlier computation from Layer 1 to Layer 9 is correct. Therefore, the result is 88572. I think that's the answer. It's a bit tedious with all those layers, but breaking it down step by step helped. I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have made this faster instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that for a second. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Maybe if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression, I could compute it without having to go through each layer. Let's consider a general case where you have n layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me denote the value at each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which also matches. Great, so the formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, that's a good consistency check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But for this problem, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but it's easy to see how it could get tedious with more layers. Anyway, the answer is 88572. I think I'm confident with that after checking it both by step-by-step computation and by deriving a formula.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively computing each layer, we find the value at each step until reaching the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3. The solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me denote each Layer n as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n from 2 to 9. So, we can model this as a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think this makes sense. Both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result, so I'm confident that this is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let me break this down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n- 9*3 = 27, wait, no, 2 is the next digit. Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3:\n- 2 (ten thousands place): 2*3=6, so 60000.\n- 9 (thousands place): 9*3=27, so 27000.\n- 5 (hundreds place): 5*3=15, so 1500.\n- 2 (tens place): 2*3=6, so 60.\n- 4 (units place): 4*3=12, so 12.\n\nNow, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, but earlier I thought 29524*3 is 88572. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me verify the Layer 9 computation. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. So, 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So that's correct. Then, 29524*3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to compute this without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute step by step. Alternatively, I might consider that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, especially in the exponentiation. 3^10 is indeed 59,049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243*243 to confirm: 200*200 = 40,000, but that's not the way. Let me compute 243*243:\n\n243\nx243\n------\nFirst, 3*243 = 729\nThen, 40*243 = 9,720\nThen, 200*243 = 48,600\nAdding them together: 729 + 9,720 = 10,449; 10,449 + 48,600 = 59,049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^10 is 59,049. Thus, a_9 is (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Let me just verify one more time, perhaps by computing a few layers again to ensure consistency. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Yes, that's correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that separately to be thorough. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.

Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, finally, Layer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, perhaps Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. But when I started, I considered Layer 1 as 1 + 3, and Layer 2 as 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on up to Layer 9, which would then be the outermost expression. Then, the entire original problem is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total number of layers is 9, and each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Hmm, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to ensure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29,524 *3 = 88,572. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me think again. The problem is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) nine times. So, when I computed Layer 9, that was the outermost (1 + 3(...)), and then the entire expression is 3 times that. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression, which might save time instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested rather than summed. Alternatively, maybe it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so maybe I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for a_9. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but since it's nested, it's a bit different. The expression is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be thought of as 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). But I think the recurrence relation approach was more straightforward. So, to summarize, by computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the value 88,572. Alternatively, using the recurrence relation, I found a closed-form formula and got the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let me break it down: 29,524 * 3. 24 * 3 = 72, write down 2 and carry over 7. 52 * 3 = 156, plus 7 is 163. Write down 3 and carry over 16. 9 * 3 = 27, plus 16 is 43. Write down 3 and carry over 4. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 4 is 10. So, writing it all together: 10, 3, 3, 2, 4. Wait, that seems off. Let me do it more carefully. 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it together: 88,572. Wait, no, that can't be right because 29,524 * 3 is actually 88,572? Let me check with another method. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 + 29,524. Let's add 29,524 + 29,524 first. 29,524 + 29,524: 24 + 24 = 48, 52 + 52 = 104, 9 + 9 = 18, 2 + 2 = 4. So, adding together: 48, 48 + 104 = 152, 152 + 104 = 256, 256 + 18 = 274, 274 + 4 = 278. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29,524 + 29,524 is 59,048. Then, adding another 29,524: 59,048 + 29,524. Let's compute that: 59,048 + 29,524. 8 + 4 = 12, 4 + 2 = 6, 0 + 5 = 5, 9 + 9 = 18, 5 + 2 = 7. Wait, that's not the right way. Let me add digit by digit:\n\n      59,048\n    +29,524\n    ---------\nStarting from the right:\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n0 + 5 = 5, write down 5.\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the sum is 88,572. So, yes, 29,524 * 3 is indeed 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me just verify all my layers again because sometimes when you're dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 1,093 * 3: 1,000 * 3 = 3,000; 93 * 3 = 279; so total is 3,000 + 279 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3,280 * 3: 3,000 * 3 = 9,000; 280 * 3 = 840; total is 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 9,841 * 3: 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 800 * 3 = 2,400; 40 * 3 = 120; 1 * 3 = 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps we can find a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see. The recursive relation is a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When k=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for k=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2,187; 3^8 = 6,561; 3^9 = 19,683; 3^{10} = 59,049. Therefore, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms the result we got by manually computing each layer. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid because both methods\u2014iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation\u2014led to the same result. It's always reassuring to cross-verify using different approaches, especially when dealing with repetitive structures like nested parentheses.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_k \\) where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\), and each subsequent layer is computed as \\( a_k = 1 + 3a_{k-1} \\).\n\n1.

So, let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems pretty big. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093, correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me check: the innermost is 1+3, which is a_1=4. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier calculation. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.

Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the whole thing. So, the final step is to compute: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 times 20,000 is 60,000; 3 times 9,000 is 27,000; 3 times 500 is 1,500; 3 times 24 is 72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1, except for the very last step where we multiplied the outermost layer by 3. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially. I guess that's because each time you're adding 3 times the previous term, which is a multiplicative factor, leading to exponential growth.

Because the original problem is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 3 * 29,524. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72.

Alternatively, 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048; then 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yep, that checks out. So, the result of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. I started from the innermost parentheses and worked my way out, computing each layer step by step. Each layer was 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, which I calculated correctly each time. Then, after reaching the outermost layer, I multiplied by 3, which gave me 88,572. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that could have been used to compute it without calculating each layer individually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I did earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of terms, computing each step manually was manageable. However, if there were more layers, we might need a formula. Let me recall the formula for such a linear recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see: The original expression is 3*(...), and inside, there are nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1 +3, then layer 2: 1 +3*(layer1), up to layer9: 1 +3*(layer8). So, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9). So, layer9 is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, this formula approach also works and confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29,000 is 87,000, and 3*524 is 1,572. So, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again more carefully to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (That's correct.) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Still correct.) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Yes.) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct.) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Yes.) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. Let's compute that: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9). So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ). Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59,049. So, 59,049 - 1 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. That matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, this method also gives me 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Just to recap, using the recurrence relation approach, I found that each layer n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, that gives me (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Alternatively, computing each layer step by step also led me to the same result. So, both methods confirm that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break down the expression starting from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern of $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Yep, that seems right. So, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me think again. Each time, I'm adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which seems to be a pattern that might relate to a geometric series or something. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression? Let me see. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, right? Let me recall. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses starting from the innermost. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, I think. Wait, let me count: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n...\nWait, actually, the number of layers is the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs, which is 9 times, right? Because the innermost is 1+3, then each next layer adds another \"1+3(\", so up to 9 layers. So, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Alternatively, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88,572. I think I did that correctly. Each step was just multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, and then doing that nine times, and then multiplying by 3 again at the end. It's interesting how quickly the numbers grow with each layer because of the multiplication by 3 each time. It's almost like an exponential growth situation, but since it's a linear recurrence, maybe it's following a specific pattern. I wonder if there's a formula to compute this without going through each layer manually. Let me think about that for a second. Each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since I've already computed up to a_9, which is 29,524, and then multiplied by 3, maybe that's the way to go. But for the sake of thoroughness, let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as computed earlier. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct again. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value we got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula. I think that's thorough enough. I didn't make any mistakes that I can see, and both methods gave me the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, that seems like a big number, but considering the multiple layers of multiplication, it might be correct. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, the final step is to compute: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 Let me calculate that. 29524 multiplied by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because 29524 * 3 should be straightforward. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 * 3 is 88572. Yes, that matches what I got earlier. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating each layer. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, layer 1 is 1 + 3, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), etc., up to layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, yes, I think I did it right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting with 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me try to model it as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, I can model this as a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find B. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let me also compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the closed-form: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) and 9A + B = 13 (from n=2). Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for layer9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. So, everything checks out. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. I notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation properly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, especially with the exponents. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^{10}=59049, so a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3 = 3000, 93*3 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). That looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. Then, we're looking for a_9, and the total expression is 3*a_9. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Great, the formula works. So, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which makes me confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've solved it correctly by computing each layer step by step and also by finding a general formula for the nth layer, which confirmed the result. It was a bit tedious to compute each layer manually, but breaking it down step by step helped prevent mistakes. I also realized that recognizing the recurrence relation could have saved time, especially if the problem had more layers. But since there were only nine layers, computing each one wasn't too bad. Overall, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Hmm, that seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or a formula. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it might be a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, so the formula seems correct. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my earlier calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, let me compute it another way. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, we can compute each a_n up to a_9 as before. But since I've already done that and cross-verified with the formula, I feel confident that 88572 is the right answer. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, which is similar to expanding a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. But since I already solved it using the recurrence relation, I don't think I need another method, but just to be thorough, let me see if there's a direct formula for such nested expressions. In general, for an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + ... )) with n layers, it can be expressed as (a*b^{n} - a)/(b - 1). Wait, let me see. Let me consider the expression S = a + b*(a + b*(a + ... )) with n layers. Then, S = a + b*S', where S' is the inner expression with n-1 layers. But in our case, a=1, b=3, and n=9. Hmm, actually, in our problem, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is a=1, b=3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, it's similar to S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with 9 layers. So, using the formula for such a nested expression, which is S = (1*(3^{n} - 1))/(3 - 1) = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, that's exactly the formula I derived earlier! So, for n=9 layers, S = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*S = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct. I think I've checked it enough times and through different methods, so I'm pretty sure the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, that seems off because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so 3*29524 should be 88572, which is a 5-digit number as well. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Finally, 0 (since there's no digit beyond 2) *3=0, but since we have a carry over from the previous step, it's 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, actually, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6. Adding the carries: 12 gives 2 with carryover 1; 6 +1=7; 15 gives 5 with carryover 1; 27 +1=28 gives 8 with carryover 2; 6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572.

Earlier, I wrote 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, but in the detailed calculation, I have 3*364 as 1,092, which is correct. So, Layer 6 is 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Then Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let me compute 3*1,093. 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 +9=3,279. So, Layer 7: 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000, 280*3=840.

So, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9). Let me calculate that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, but wait, 9 is the next digit? Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4. So, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Therefore, 3*29524=88572. So, the entire expression simplifies down to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the steps check out. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed by multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and adding 1. It's interesting how each layer's value grows exponentially. I remember that this kind of pattern is similar to a geometric series or something like that, but in this case, it's a nested expression. I wonder if there's a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step. Let me think about that for a second. If I let each layer be defined recursively, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. So, L(1)=4, L(2)=1 + 3*4=13, L(3)=1 + 3*13=40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: L(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: L(3)=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. Yep, it works. So, the formula is L(n)=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, L(9)=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without going through each layer, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for this problem, since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way. It's interesting to see how the formula helps in generalizing the solution. I think this problem is a good example of how recognizing patterns and using recurrence relations can simplify the computation process, especially for nested or recursive expressions. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 should be 88,572.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait a second, but let me check my layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.

But let me check each step again to be thorough.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1,092=1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093=1+3,279=3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280=1+9,840=9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841=1+29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524=88,572. Correct.\n\nHmm, so I think I did it right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach, perhaps using a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nLet me define each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9, and then the total expression is 3*L_9.\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for L_n.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern. Let's compute the first few layers:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093.\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280.\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841.\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524.\n\nSo, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049; 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThen, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, the final computation is: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 2*3 = 6, write down 6.

Let me recount the layers to make sure. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: 1+3(1+3(...)) So, each time, there's a 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of layers: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...), so total layers would be 9, as I initially thought. So, computing up to Layer 9 gives 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which seems correct based on the previous steps. Let me double-check the computations for each layer to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but I feel like that's a very large number. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start instead of computing each layer, which would have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since I was just starting out, breaking it down step by step was a good way to ensure I didn't make a mistake. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation can lead to a more efficient solution. I guess practice helps in identifying such patterns quickly. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me check if I correctly accounted for all layers. The original expression had nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me count the layers again as I computed them: Layer 1: innermost, 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: next out, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, nine layers, each computed correctly. Therefore, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer from 1 to 9, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think this makes sense because each layer is 1 plus three times the previous layer, and each time, the numbers are growing exponentially, which makes sense given the multiplicative factors. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers, each of which is computed starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward.

Wait, let me check. The original expression is 3*(...), and the innermost Layer 1 is inside nine layers. So after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses, we still have to multiply by the initial 3. So, the final step is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result should be 88572. Let me just verify that I didn't make any mistakes in each step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think if there's a formula I could have used instead of computing each layer manually. The general form here is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, for each layer, the term is 1 plus three times the previous term. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is n=9, would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by the initial 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final step is to compute: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Let me check my multiplication again. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yeah, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier results. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, using the formula for the recurrence relation. That's reassuring. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, it's like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. But in this case, it's more of a linear nested expression rather than a series. But the recurrence approach seems solid. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524=88572, yes that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without doing each layer step by step, but since the problem isn't too long, step by step is manageable. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc., as I computed before. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation.

Let me do this multiplication step by step. 24 * 3 = 72, write down 2 and carry over 7. 524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, plus 7 carried over is 15. So, 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 5*3=15, plus 1 carried over is 16. Write down 6 and carry over 1. 9*3=27, plus 1 carried over is 28. So, 28. So, putting it all together: 28,657,2? Wait, that seems off. Wait, no, let me redo that multiplication more carefully. 29,524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Wait, that can't be right because 29,524 * 3 is actually 88,572. Let me verify: 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check for any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step might be faster. However, for learning purposes, maybe I can derive a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 =88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let's compute that: 3*(59,049 -1)/2 =3*(59,048)/2=3*29,524=88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88,572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = Let me do that multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, 3 * 29,524 equals 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29,524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, that still checks out. Hmm, maybe that's correct after all. Alternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution and particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. Each step follows logically, and the recursive approach as well as the closed-form formula both lead to the same result. So, I think I'm good.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using the recursive formula and solving it step by step, we determine that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct.

Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. So, I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can compute it step by step as I did before. Alternatively, solving the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is correct because both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation formula give the same result.
