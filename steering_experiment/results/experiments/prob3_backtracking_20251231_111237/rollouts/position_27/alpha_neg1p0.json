    "text": " Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, okay, so far so good. Let me keep going. Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me compute that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the total value is 88572. Wait, but let me just verify each step because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long calculation. Let's go back to each layer and make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see if each layer follows a certain formula. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for the nth layer. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, starting from L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_p(n) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. That's exactly what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2, then 3*L(9) =3*(3^10 -1)/2= (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3*L(9)= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280.

Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4 * 3 = 12, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any layers or make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but let me verify a couple of the layers to be sure. Let's check Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. 24*3=72, so 4*3=12, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. It was a bit tedious with all those layers, but breaking it down step by step helped. I just had to make sure I computed each layer correctly before moving on to the next one, and then finally multiplied the last result by 3. I didn't see any errors in my calculations, so I feel confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me write it out properly:\n\n   29524\nx      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. But let me verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. It looks like each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u21d2 9/2 = 3C \u21d2 C = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with our earlier calculations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute Layer 9 using the formula and then multiply by 3. Layer 9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula for the entire expression: The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Exactly the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step by step computation, using the recurrence relation, and applying the formula directly. All methods lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric sequence or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let's denote L(n) as the value of layer n, where n=1 is the innermost. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps using the method for solving linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is: L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Substituting into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L(4)= (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L(5)= (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L(6)= (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L(7)= (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L(8)= (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression up to layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144, and 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result without computing each layer step by step. That's pretty cool. It shows how recognizing a pattern and deriving a formula can make the problem much easier. But since I initially didn't see the pattern, breaking it down step by step was the way to go. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it sufficiently, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct.

So, I think I did this correctly. It's a bit time-consuming, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have made this computation faster, especially if there were more layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's non-homogeneous. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the value inside the outermost 3 times is 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524=88572, as before. Therefore, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula helped confirm that my step-by-step computation was correct. It's interesting because without recognizing the pattern, one might get lost in the repetitive computation, but seeing it as a recurrence relation makes it more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think that's the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since the numbers get large quickly, maybe computing each layer step by step is the most straightforward way. Let me see if there's another approach, just to confirm. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 1 to 10, but I think the recurrence approach is clearer here. Another way to think about it is that each layer adds a power of 3, so the total sum is a geometric series with ratio 3. But since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a bit different. Wait, actually, using the closed-form formula, we can see that the final value before multiplying by 3 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, all methods point to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is (3^{10} - 1)/2, which equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's break it down to make sure I don't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Wait, but 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Okay, so that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Layer 4: 121 Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let's continue this way. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, let's compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute that step by step. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29,524 equals 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. So, L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The recurrence is non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. Let me write the recurrence as: L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1. The homogeneous part is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4. So, when n=1, L(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works for the layers I computed. Therefore, for layer n=9: L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L(9))=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to calculate each layer, which is efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But since in this problem there are 9 layers, it's manageable either way. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Wait, no. Let me check the original problem again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and the outermost operation is 3 times the first layer. Wait, but when I counted the layers, I started from the innermost as Layer 1, and each subsequent layer added another 3*(previous). So, if the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations for each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of layer n, where n=1 is the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait a second, 121 is 11 squared, 4 is 2 squared, 13 isn't a square, but 40 isn't either. Hmm, maybe not a perfect square pattern, but perhaps another pattern. Alternatively, maybe each L_n can be represented as (3^(n) - 1)/2. Let me test this. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but L_1 is 4, so that doesn't fit. Maybe it's 3^n + something. Let me try to find a general formula. Let's see, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 =4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B =4. Now, let's find another condition. For n=2: L_2=1 +3*L_1=1+3*4=13. Using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B=9A + B=13. Now we have two equations: 3A + B =4 and 9A + B=13. Subtract the first from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B)=13 -4 =>6A=9 =>A=9/6=3/2=1.5. Now, substitute A=3/2 into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B=4 =>9/2 + B=4 =>B=4 -9/2= (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, L_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, L_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, L_3=40. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my previous step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the general formula checks out with the initial layers, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows the formula (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. For the 9th layer, this gives 29,524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Moving on to Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, the final computation would be: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 times 20,000 is 60,000. 3 times 9,000 is 27,000, so 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. Then, 3 times 500 is 1,500, so 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. Then, 3 times 24 is 72. So, adding that: 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step seems manageable. Alternatively, if I consider each layer as a term in a geometric sequence, maybe I can find a formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*(Layer 9)= 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which might be faster for larger numbers. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, computing each step is feasible.

    "text": " Layer 4 is 121. Okay, moving on. Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 times 29524. Let me break it down: 3 * 29524 = 3 * (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*24 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Let me compute it again: 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000. 9000 * 3 = 27000. 500 * 3 = 1500. 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.

Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 times the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total value would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nLet's compute from right to left:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check the multiplication again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572. So, the total value is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Maybe I miscalculated one of the layers earlier. Let me go back step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360 +3=363. So, 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. So, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the multiplication one more time because 29524*3 seems a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 29524 as 29000 + 524.\n\nSo, 29000*3=87000.\n\n524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 1500 +72=1572.\n\nSo, 87000 + 1572=88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm a bit confused because when I first saw the problem, I thought maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression, perhaps something related to geometric series or recursion. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13, which matches Layer 2. Similarly, a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +3*13=40, which is Layer 3. So, indeed, each a_n corresponds to Layer n. So, since we have nine layers, we're computing up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2. Then, 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2. So, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*a_9= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By solving the recurrence, we find that each layer \\( a_n \\) can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this results in \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, that's getting big quickly. Let me keep going. Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Wow, this is growing exponentially, I think. Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the total expression is 3*Layer 9. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait a second, but I just realized something. The original problem has 9 layers, right? Let me count the parentheses again to make sure I didn't miss any layers. Starting from the innermost: Each time I see a (1 + 3(...)), that's a layer. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me count them: The innermost is the first, then each step out is another layer. So, if I have 9 layers, then Layer 1 is innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. Therefore, 3*Layer 9 is 3*29524, which is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make an error in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers are correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but I just thought of something else. The expression is 3*(Layer 9). But Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, when I compute 3*(Layer 9), it's 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 8)). Which is 3*1 + 3*3*(Layer 8) = 3 + 9*(Layer 8). But maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something. Wait, let me see. Alternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is built upon the previous one. Let's say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on. So, in this case, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, right? Because each layer is multiplied by 3, except the innermost one. Wait, no, actually, each layer is inside another 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th term in this sequence. So, if I compute a_9 correctly, then 3*a_9 is the answer. So, from my earlier computation, a_9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. 3*29524: 29524 *3. Let me compute it digit by digit: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've covered all the steps and double-checked my work, so I don't see any mistakes.

Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Next, Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Now, Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72.

    "text": " Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, okay, I can see a pattern here where each layer is 1 plus three times the previous layer. Let me write this down as a recursive formula: Let L(n) be the value of layer n, where n starts at 1 for the innermost. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Wait, no, L(1) is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, if I can compute L(n) up to n=9, then the entire expression would be 3*(L(9)), since the outermost part is 3 times the ninth layer. Let me verify that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, yes, the outermost operation is 3 times the value of the entire nested expression, which is L(9). Therefore, my goal is to compute L(9) and then multiply it by 3. Let me compute each layer step by step: L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 L(3) = 1 + 3*L(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 L(4) = 1 + 3*L(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 L(5) = 1 + 3*L(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 L(6) = 1 + 3*L(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L(7) = 1 + 3*L(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L(8) = 1 + 3*L(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L(9) = 1 + 3*L(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, once I have L(9) = 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that. So, 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3 = 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because 29,524 *3: 20,000 *3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total value is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing L(9). Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. L(1)=4, correct. L(2)=1 +3*4=13, correct. L(3)=1 +3*13=40, correct. L(4)=1 +3*40=121, correct. L(5)=1 +3*121=364, correct. L(6)=1 +3*364=1093, correct. L(7)=1 +3*1093=3280, correct. L(8)=1 +3*3280=9841, correct. L(9)=1 +3*9841=29524, correct. Then 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me think about that. The general form is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques for such recursions. The homogeneous solution would be L(n) = A*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2= (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, L(n)= (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L(1)= (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(9)= (3^10 -1)/2. Wait, because n=9: L(9)= (3^(10)-1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 3^10=59,049. Then, L(9)= (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29,524=88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent. Since L(n)= (3^(n+1) -1)/2, for n=9, it's 3^10, which is correct. So yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3^10 directly. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, 3^10=59,049. Then, L(9)= (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. So, 3*29,524=88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just check each step again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting from L(1) up to L(9): L(1)=4, L(2)=13, L(3)=40, L(4)=121, L(5)=364, L(6)=1093, L(7)=3280, L(8)=9841, L(9)=29524. Each step is 1 + 3*previous, which seems correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula: L(9)= (3^10 -1)/2= (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Then, 3*29,524=88,572.

Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, that's right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, yes. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, yes. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the right answer. Each layer was computed correctly, and the multiplication at the end is accurate. It's interesting how each layer builds on the previous one, tripling and adding 1 each time, leading to such a large number after nine iterations. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by tripling the previous result and adding 1.

But wait, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the total value would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break that down. 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572.

Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, that gives 88572. Therefore, the total value is 88572. Let me just verify that each step was correct because that seems like a lot. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4.

    "text": " Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, this seems to be growing quite rapidly. Let me continue this way, but I need to be careful to compute each layer correctly. Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right?

Each layer checks out, and the final multiplication by 3 gives me 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to see if I get the same result. Sometimes, working through a problem two different ways can help catch any mistakes. Let me consider the structure of the expression. It's a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, in mathematical terms, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nAnd the total expression is 3*L_9.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. Let's write out the first few terms:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each L_n is following a pattern similar to powers of 3, but not exactly. Let's see:\n\nL_1 = 4 = 3 + 1\n\nL_2 = 13 = 3*4 + 1\n\nL_3 = 40 = 3*13 + 1\n\nWait, this seems like each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, in general, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nL_p = 3*L_p + 1\n\nSolving for L_p:\n\nL_p - 3L_p = 1 => -2L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I have:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that my answer is correct. Just to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure of the expression.\n\n2. Start computing from the innermost parentheses, moving outward step by step.\n\n3. Notice the pattern of each layer being 3 times the previous layer plus 1.\n\n4. Formulate a recurrence relation and find its closed-form solution.\n\n5. Use the closed-form formula to compute the value of the innermost layers efficiently.\n\n6. Multiply the final layer by 3 to get the total result.\n\nThroughout this process, double-checking each step helped ensure accuracy. It's easy to make arithmetic errors when dealing with large numbers, so careful computation is essential. I also considered alternative methods, like finding a general formula, which not only confirmed my initial step-by-step computation but also provided a deeper understanding of how the expression behaves. This problem is a good example of how recognizing patterns and using mathematical tools like recurrence relations can simplify what initially looks like a complex problem.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step and recognizing the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's break it down to make sure I don't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, yes, 88572. So, it's correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let's see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Each time, we have a 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I expand this, each layer adds a term that is 3^k, where k is the depth of the layer. Wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps it's a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me see. Let me try to write the expression as a sum. Let's denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me see how many terms there are. Each time, we have a 1, then a 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps E can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me think recursively. If I let E_n be the expression with n layers, then E_n = 3*(1 + 3*E_{n-1}). With E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, so E_1 would be 3*(1 + 3) = 12, then E_2 = 3*(1 + 3*E_1) = 3*(1 + 3*12) = 3*(1 + 36) = 3*37 = 111, and so on. But in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, E_9 = 3*(1 + 3*E_8). Let me compute E_1 to E_9 to see if it matches my previous result. E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. E_2 = 3*(1 + 3*12) = 3*(1 + 36) = 3*37 = 111. E_3 = 3*(1 + 3*111) = 3*(1 + 333) = 3*334 = 1002. E_4 = 3*(1 + 3*1002) = 3*(1 + 3006) = 3*3007 = 9021. E_5 = 3*(1 + 3*9021) = 3*(1 + 27063) = 3*27064 = 81192. E_6 = 3*(1 + 3*81192) = 3*(1 + 243576) = 3*243577 = 730731. E_7 = 3*(1 + 3*730731) = 3*(1 + 2192193) = 3*2192194 = 6576582. E_8 = 3*(1 + 3*6576582) = 3*(1 + 19729746) = 3*19729747 = 59189241. E_9 = 3*(1 + 3*59189241) = 3*(1 + 177567723) = 3*177567724 = 532703172. Wait a minute, that's a different result than before. Hmm, that's concerning. Earlier, I had 88,572, but using this method, I get 532,703,172. Clearly, there's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check where I went wrong. Wait, in the first method, I computed each layer as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4, and then multiplied by 3 at the end. In the second method, I defined E_n as the entire expression with n layers, so E_n = 3*(1 + 3*E_{n-1}), starting from E_1=12. But in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which has 9 layers. So, in the first method, I computed up to L_9, then multiplied by 3. In the second method, I computed E_9, which already includes that multiplication. Therefore, in the first method, I have E = 3*L_9, where L_9 is the innermost expression. In the second method, E_n already includes the multiplication by 3 at each step. So, in the first method, I computed L_9 = 29524, then E = 3*29524 = 88572. In the second method, I computed E_9 = 532703172, which is much larger. So, which one is correct? Let me see the structure of the problem again. The problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of 1+3(...) parts: Let's see, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(...), etc. How many times does 1+3 occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after 1+. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, in total, how many layers are there? Let me see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Let's see: Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(.\n\nStarting from the first 3(1 + 3(...)), each time we have a new layer. So, the structure is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because each time we have a new 1 + 3(...), and there are 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3(...). Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, after the first 3(...), there are 9 opening parentheses: Each 1 + 3(...) is a new layer. So, layers 1 to 9. Therefore, in the first method, I computed up to L_9 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get E = 88572. In the second method, I computed E_9, which is the entire expression with 9 layers, which is 532,703,172. But the problem is to compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with 9 layers. So, which one is correct? Let me see. If I have n layers, where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), then the total expression is 3*(L_n). So, in the first method, L_n is the value after n layers, then multiplied by 3. In the second method, E_n is already the entire expression with n layers, which is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, in the problem, we have 9 layers, so E_9 would be the answer. But in the first method, I computed L_9 = 29524, then E = 3*L_9 = 88572. However, in the second method, E_9 = 532,703,172. So, which is correct? Let me see. Let's compute E_1: 3*(1 + 3) = 12. Correct. E_2: 3*(1 + 3*E_1) = 3*(1 + 3*12) = 3*(1 + 36) = 3*37 = 111. Correct. E_3: 3*(1 + 3*111) = 3*(1 + 333) = 3*334 = 1002. Correct. E_4: 3*(1 + 3*1002) = 3*(1 + 3006) = 3*3007 = 9021. Correct. E_5: 3*(1 + 3*9021) = 3*(1 + 27063) = 3*27064 = 81192. Correct. E_6: 3*(1 + 3*81192) = 3*(1 + 243576) = 3*243577 = 730731. Correct. E_7: 3*(1 + 3*730731) = 3*(1 + 2192193) = 3*2192194 = 6576582. Correct. E_8: 3*(1 + 3*6576582) = 3*(1 + 19729746) = 3*19729747 = 59189241. Correct. E_9: 3*(1 + 3*59189241) = 3*(1 + 177567723) = 3*177567724 = 532703172. So, according to this, E_9 is 532,703,172. But in the first method, I had E = 3*L_9 = 88,572. So, why the discrepancy? Let me see. I think the confusion is about how the layers are defined. In the first method, I considered L_n as the innermost expression after n layers, i.e., L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. In the second method, E_n is the entire expression with n layers, which is 3*(1 + 3*E_{n-1}), starting from E_1 = 12. So, in the first method, L_n is the innermost expression after n layers, and E = 3*L_n. In the second method, E_n is the entire expression with n layers, which is equivalent to 3*(1 + 3*E_{n-1}). Therefore, if the problem has 9 layers, then E_9 is the answer. But in the first method, I computed L_9 = 29524, then E = 3*29524 = 88572. But according to the second method, E_9 = 532,703,172. So, which one is correct? Let me see. Let me compute the expression manually for a smaller number of layers to see which method is correct. Let's take n=1: The expression is 3*(1 + 3) = 12. According to the first method: L_1 = 4, E = 3*4 = 12. Correct. According to the second method: E_1 = 12. Correct. Now, n=2: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. According to the first method: L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, E = 3*13 = 39. Correct. According to the second method: E_1 =12, E_2 =3*(1 + 3*12)=3*(1 +36)=3*37=111. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, no, wait, for n=2, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), which is 3*(1 + 3*4)=3*13=39. But according to the second method, E_2=111, which is incorrect. So, there's a problem here. So, in the second method, E_n is not matching the actual expression for n=2. Therefore, the second method is flawed. So, where did I go wrong in the second method? Let me re-examine. I defined E_n as 3*(1 + 3*E_{n-1}), starting from E_1=12. But for n=2, the expression should be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))=3*(1 + 3*4)=3*13=39. But according to E_n, E_2=3*(1 + 3*E_1)=3*(1 + 3*12)=3*37=111, which is incorrect. So, the issue is that E_n is not correctly modeling the problem. The problem is that in the second method, I assumed E_n = 3*(1 + 3*E_{n-1}), but actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the entire expression is 3*(L_n), where L_n is the innermost expression after n layers. Therefore, the first method is correct, and the second method incorrectly models the recurrence. Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572. Let me confirm this with another approach. Let me consider the expression as a sum. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost layer: L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 =13. L_3=1 +3*13=40. L_4=1 +3*40=121. L_5=1 +3*121=364. L_6=1 +3*364=1093. L_7=1 +3*1093=3280. L_8=1 +3*3280=9841. L_9=1 +3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with the first method. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. Each L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}. So, L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 1, we can assume L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C=1 +3*C => C=1/(1-3)= -1/2. So, general solution: L_n = A*3^n -1/2. Using the initial condition L_1=4: 4 =A*3 -1/2 => A*3=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=3/2. Therefore, L_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another confirmation. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final computation would be 3 * 29524.

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 So, the final result is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but I just realized something. Each time I computed a layer, I used the previous layer's result and multiplied by 3, then added 1. So, each layer n is 1 + 3*(layer n-1). That's a recurrence relation. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of sequence. Let me think about it. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Using the closed-form solution derived from the recurrence relation, we find that each layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524. I can compute this by breaking it down: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. It seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. n=2: L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we can set up two equations: 3A + B = 4, 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Now, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the values I have. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, I'll verify 3^10 again. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, and 3^10 is 59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 divided by 2 is 29524.5, and subtracting 0.5 gives 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Yep, everything checks out.

Hmm, 3*364, let's compute that. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.

Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result should be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again to be sure. 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, yes, it's 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, it's manageable to compute each step manually. Alternatively, I might have noticed that each layer is following a recurrence relation, perhaps similar to a geometric series or something else. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, each term is defined based on the previous term. This recurrence relation might have a closed-form solution, which could save time for larger numbers of layers, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is feasible. The recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} is a linear recurrence. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, since the expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049, 3^11=177,147. So, 3^{11} = 177,147. Then, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression, which might be more efficient for larger numbers of layers. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, either method works. I think I've verified it enough. The final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Now, Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Let me break this down. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute it step by step: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 7, 7, 8, 5, 2. So, 88,572? Wait, let me check that again. 29,524 * 3: Let's do it properly. 29,524\n\u00d7         3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88,572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check with another method. 29,524 \u00d7 3: 30,000 \u00d7 3 = 90,000. But 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 90,000 - (476 \u00d7 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check my steps because that seems like a big number, and I don't want to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the computations. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3\u00d729524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is defined based on the previous one. Then, the problem is computing a_9, and then multiplying by 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Now, is there a closed-form solution for a_n? Let me try to find a pattern or formula for a_n. Let's compute the first few terms: a_1 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2? Wait, 3^2 is 9, 9 - 1 = 8, 8/2 = 4. Yes, that works. a_2 = 13. Let's see: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. a_3 = 40. (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. a_4 = 121. (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. a_5 = 364. (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. a_6 = 1093. (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. a_7 = 3280. (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. a_8 = 9841. (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. a_9 = 29524. (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, I see a pattern here. It seems that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test that. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=13. Correct. So, yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, that matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Correct. So, that's another way to think about it, using exponents. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern where a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. The outermost layer, after computing all nine layers, results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested expression. This might be similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me think about it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the closed-form formula. Either way, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify each step once more. Starting with a_1: 1+3=4. Correct. a_2: 1 +3*4=13. Correct. a_3:1 +3*13=40. Correct. a_4:1 +3*40=121. Correct. a_5:1 +3*121=364. Correct. a_6:1 +3*364=1093. Correct. a_7:1 +3*1093=3280. Correct. a_8:1 +3*3280=9841. Correct. a_9:1 +3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Correct. Alternatively, using the formula: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572. Yes, that's consistent.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute it again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.
