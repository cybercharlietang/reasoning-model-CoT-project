Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.

Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, and 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that could represent this without computing each layer step by step. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 terms, computing each step is manageable. However, if we wanted a formula for a_n, we could solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without going through each layer. But since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step was manageable. But knowing the formula is useful for similar problems with more layers. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have been faster and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me consider the general form. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... and so on, up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, looking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^{6} - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\nFor n=6: a_6 = (3^{7} - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\nFor n=7: a_7 = (3^{8} - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\nFor n=8: a_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\nFor n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start instead of computing each layer, which would have been more efficient. But since I was computing step by step, it worked out. I just need to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way. Let me just recheck a few layers again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, all correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this seems like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. This recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation: r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, since the original expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the multiple methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated nine times, resulting in the outermost layer being 29,524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer of 88,572.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6. So writing it out: 2 9 5 2 4 * 3 = 8 8 5 7 2. Yes, that's correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since the expression is finite with 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula for a geometric progression. The expression seems similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me consider that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me try to find a pattern. Let's compute the first few a_n terms: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as I computed earlier. Now, let's see if there's a pattern or a formula for a_n. Looking at the terms: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Let me see if each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let's check: a_2 = 3*a_1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. Correct. a_3 = 3*a_2 + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 40. Correct. a_4 = 3*a_3 + 1 = 3*40 + 1 = 121. Correct. So, in general, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that confirms the result. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially. Either way, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which simplifies the computation. Applying this formula to the outermost layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous. Let's see: Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, we have L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, etc., as before. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: At n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, for n=9, Layer 9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct. Then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression would be 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see:\n\nWe have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can look for a pattern or find a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me compute the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 13\n\nL_3 = 40\n\nL_4 = 121\n\nL_5 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 29524\n\nHmm, these numbers look familiar. Let me see if they relate to powers of 3.\n\nCompute 3^0 = 1\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nHmm, comparing L_n with 3^n:\n\nL_1 = 4 vs 3^1 = 3\n\nL_2 = 13 vs 3^2 = 9\n\nL_3 = 40 vs 3^3 = 27\n\nL_4 = 121 vs 3^4 = 81\n\nL_5 = 364 vs 3^5 = 243\n\nHmm, not exactly matching, but perhaps there's a relationship. Let me compute L_n - 3^{n}:\n\nL_1 - 3^1 = 4 - 3 = 1\n\nL_2 - 3^2 = 13 - 9 = 4\n\nL_3 - 3^3 = 40 - 27 = 13\n\nL_4 - 3^4 = 121 - 81 = 40\n\nL_5 - 3^5 = 364 - 243 = 121\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. L_n - 3^n = L_{n-1}\n\nBecause:\n\nL_1 - 3^1 = 1 = L_0? Wait, but L_0 isn't defined here. Alternatively, perhaps L_n = 3^n + L_{n-1}.\n\nWait, from the above:\n\nL_1 = 4 = 3 + 1\n\nL_2 = 13 = 9 + 4\n\nL_3 = 40 = 27 + 13\n\nL_4 = 121 = 81 + 40\n\nYes, so L_n = 3^n + L_{n-1}.\n\nWith L_1 = 4 = 3^1 + 1.\n\nWait, so L_n = 3^n + L_{n-1}, and L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, we can write L_n = 3^n + L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive formula. Let's try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but let's see: The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 1, we can try a constant solution, L_n^p = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 3^n + D, which doesn't make sense because it implies 0 = 3^n, which isn't possible. So maybe the particular solution is a constant, but perhaps we need to adjust the approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the recurrence is L_n = 3^n + L_{n-1}, we can write it as L_n - L_{n-1} = 3^n.\n\nThis is a telescoping series. Let's sum both sides from n=2 to n=k:\n\nSum_{n=2}^k (L_n - L_{n-1}) = Sum_{n=2}^k 3^n.\n\nThe left side telescopes to L_k - L_1.\n\nThe right side is a geometric series: Sum_{n=2}^k 3^n = (3^{k+1} - 3^2)/(3 - 1) = (3^{k+1} - 9)/2.\n\nSo, L_k - L_1 = (3^{k+1} - 9)/2.\n\nWe know L_1 = 4, so:\n\nL_k = 4 + (3^{k+1} - 9)/2 = (8 + 3^{k+1} - 9)/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with the values we have:\n\nFor k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nk=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nk=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nk=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nk=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. So, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and the formula seems to hold. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using powers of 3. Using the closed-form formula for the nth layer, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next nested term). There are nine layers in total, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Closed-Form Formula:**\n   Each layer L_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For Layer 9 (n=9), this is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But let me just double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if I can use that to find a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. The initial condition is L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Let's compute a few more terms to see if we can find a pattern. L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, solving the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get to the same answer, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a formula. That might have saved time instead of computing each layer, but since I didn't think of it initially, I did it step by step. Either way, both methods lead to the same result. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation. The final result after computing all layers and multiplying by 3 is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a*r^{n} + b, where r is the common ratio and b is a constant. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is L_9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_0)*(r^n). Wait, but actually, since each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, how many layers do we have? Let me count. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So starting from the innermost, which is a_1, up to a_9. So for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think this method is more efficient because it uses the recurrence relation formula, so I don't have to compute each layer step by step. It's especially useful if there are many layers, as it would save a lot of time. But for just nine layers, both methods work. I'm glad I checked it both ways because it reduces the chance of making a mistake. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same answer as when I computed each layer manually. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively calculating each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward.

Starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see:\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, let's find the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet's check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, it's manageable. I remember that expressions like this, where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), can sometimes be represented using a geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that for a moment. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as we computed earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check if this formula works for the first few terms: For n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without manually calculating each layer, which is much more efficient, especially if the expression were longer. But since I had to compute each layer step by step initially, it's good that I verified the formula matches the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses and then multiplying by 3. After computing each layer, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer follows a pattern. Using the formula derived from the linear recurrence relation, we find that the value of the innermost expression after nine layers is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me just cross-verify my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions. The expression seems to be a geometric series. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the formula confirms the step-by-step computation. That's reassuring. So, the answer is 88572. I think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So the result is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have nine layers, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can express the entire expression using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think I'm confident with this answer now. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find each layer's value. Recognizing the pattern, we use the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, which simplifies the computation. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, it's a linear recursion where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n goes from 1 to 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result for Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, ensuring each arithmetic operation is correct. 3. Alternatively, model the problem as a recurrence relation and solve it to find a closed-form expression, then compute the result. 4.

So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 =40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 =121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363=364. Correct.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). It's a geometric series, perhaps? Let's see. Let me consider that each layer is a term in a geometric sequence. Let me denote the innermost term as a1, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on. So in general, an = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a1 = 1 + 3. Wait, no, a1 is the innermost term, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1 =1 +3*4=13. a3=1 +3*a2=1 +3*13=40. Etc., as I computed before. So this is a recurrence relation: an = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a1=4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. Let me recall the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence relation. The recurrence is an = c*an-1 + d, where in this case, c=3 and d=1. The solution is an = c^(n) * a0 + d*(c^(n) - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in our case, a1=4, so maybe the index is shifted. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. The homogeneous solution is an^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say an^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is an = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1=4. So, when n=1, a1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, an= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2= (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, an= (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a1=(3^(2)-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a9=(3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572, as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a sum, it's a geometric series with each term multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). If I expand this, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms? Wait, no, actually, each time you go a layer out, you add another power of 3. Let me think. The innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 3 multiplier. So, the total number of layers is 9, meaning that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Alternatively, perhaps the total expression can be represented as a geometric series with 9 terms, where each term is 3^k, but I need to check. Wait, when I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with 9 layers. Each layer adds another 3 multiplier. So, expanding, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms. Wait, but that would be 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... +3^9. But let me check: The innermost term is 1 + 3, so when you compute each layer, each time you're adding a higher power of 3. Let me see: The innermost is 1 + 3 =4, which is 3^1 +1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 +3*4=13, which is 1 + 3*(3 +1)=1 +9 +3=13.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Alternatively, maybe the expansion is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). If I expand it, it would be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms. So, that would be a geometric series with ratio 3 and 9 terms. The sum of a geometric series is (r^n -1)/(r -1). So, sum = (3^9 -1)/(3-1)= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Wait, but that's just the sum inside the outermost 3*. So, the total expression would be 3*9841=29523. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier result. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Wait, let me think again. If I have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, then each layer corresponds to a term in the geometric series. So, the innermost term is 1 +3=4, which is 3^1 +1. The next layer is 1 +3*(4)=13, which is 3^2 +3 +1. The next layer is 1 +3*(13)=40, which is 3^3 +3^2 +3 +1. So, each layer n adds a term of 3^(n). Therefore, after 9 layers, the innermost expression would be 3^9 +3^8 + ... +3^1 +1. Wait, but that's the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, which is (3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572, which matches my earlier result. Alternatively, if I think of each layer as adding another term in the geometric series, then the sum inside the outermost 3 is the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, which is (3^10 -1)/2=29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, both methods lead me to the same answer, so I'm confident that the result is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a base-3 number or something, but I think the methods I've used are sufficient. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 +3=4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, layer 2:13, layer3:40, layer4:121, layer5:364, layer6:1093, layer7:3280, layer8:9841, layer9:29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the geometric series formula, the sum inside is (3^10 -1)/2=29524, so 3*29524=88572. Both methods give the same result, so I think it's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and work from the innermost parentheses outward.

So adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, that's correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. So, left-hand side: C*3^{n} + D. Right-hand side: C*3^{n} + 3D + 1. Equate both sides: C*3^{n} + D = C*3^{n} + 3D + 1. Subtract C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 3D + 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^{1} + D = 3C + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Wait, no, actually, in the problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is a_1=4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result. That confirms it. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we find the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think if this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, a_1 would be the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n, which might help in computing the value without having to compute each layer manually, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn = 3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn = 4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn = 5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn = 6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn = 7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn = 8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn = 9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3 * a_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, I get the same answer, 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about whether there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p =1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p -3*a_p =1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9. So, layer 9 is a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check: If n=1, a_1= (3^2 -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4, which matches. So yes, a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, layer 9 is a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2.\n\n3^{10}=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're essentially multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's a geometric series. But in this case, since it's nested, it's a bit different. However, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward here.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute a few layers using the formula to see if they match:\n\nFor n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, using this formula, we can compute a_9 directly without computing each layer, which would be more efficient for larger n. But since n=9 isn't too large, computing each layer step by step is manageable.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying using a recurrence relation, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So this seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's expand the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, but this time, perhaps using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572. Yep, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could compute 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{10} -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, all methods lead to the same result. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try that. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the values we have: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*something, which seems similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's more like a linear recurrence, as I did before. So, I think the method I used is solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the result. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2.

    "text": " Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this problem as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time, which is a common ratio. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This is similar to a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the nth term. But since there are nine layers, it's a finite recursion, so perhaps it's a geometric series with a finite number of terms. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about how such expressions are evaluated. Each time, you have a term that's 1 + 3 times the next term. So, if I denote the innermost term as a base case, and then each subsequent term is built upon that, it's like a geometric progression with each term being 3 times the previous plus 1. Wait, but actually, each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Since each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have nine layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Wait, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. Now, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, we need a_9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, I could recognize that each time you have a term like 1 + 3*(something), it's similar to expanding a geometric series. Let me think about that. If I consider the expression starting from the innermost part, each time you have 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. But in this case, it's not a simple geometric series because each term is being added after being multiplied by 3. However, the recurrence relation approach worked well, so maybe that's the most straightforward way. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 =13= 3^2 + 3^0? Wait, 3^2 is 9, 9 + 4=13? Hmm, not quite. Wait, 13 is 9 + 4, but 4 is 3 +1, so 13=9 +3 +1=3^2 +3^1 +3^0. Wait, that's interesting. Let me check the next layer: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Now, 40=27 + 9 + 3 +1=3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +3^0=40. Wait, 3^3 is 27, 27 +9=36, 36+3=39, 39+1=40. So, Layer 3 is 3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +3^0=40. Similarly, Layer 4:1 +3*40=121. Now, 3^4=81, 81 + 40=121. But 40 is Layer 3, which is 3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +3^0. So, Layer 4=3^4 + Layer3=3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +3^0=81+27+9+3+1=121. So, it seems that each Layer n is equal to the sum of 3^0 +3^1 +3^2 +...+3^n. Wait, let me check that. For Layer 1: 1 +3=4=3^0 +3^1=1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1 +3*4=13=3^0 +3^1 +3^2=1+3+9=13. Correct. Layer3:40=1+3+9+27=40. Correct. Layer4:121=1+3+9+27+81=121. Correct. So, in general, Layer n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. But wait, the sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k = (r^{n+1} -1)/(r-1). In this case, r=3, so sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Which matches the formula I derived earlier using the recurrence relation. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer9= (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, this confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula to ensure consistency. For n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct. n=2: (27-1)/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243-1)/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729-1)/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187-1)/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (6561-1)/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (19683-1)/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (59049-1)/2=29524. Correct. So, all layers computed via the formula match the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) can be expressed as \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just verify with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, using the formula, I can compute a_9 directly, which saves time instead of computing each layer step by step. But since the problem only has 9 layers, it's manageable either way. So, yeah, the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, then each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a general formula for L(n). Let me try to find a pattern. Let's compute the first few terms manually to see if a pattern emerges. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, the numbers are growing exponentially, which makes sense because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if I can express L(n) in terms of a geometric series. The recursive formula is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can write it as L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1. The homogeneous solution would be L(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, I can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the equation: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have L9, which is n=9: L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^(10) -1)/2 ) = (3*3^10 -3)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
