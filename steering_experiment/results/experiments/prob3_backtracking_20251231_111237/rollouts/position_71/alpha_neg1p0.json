So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the number of layers isn't too large, doing it step by step is manageable. But just to explore, maybe recognizing that each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which is reassuring. This also shows that recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence can save time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for 9 layers, step-by-step computation is manageable. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.

Then 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that works. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when dealing with nested parentheses, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, how many 1+3(...) are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of layers: Each time I have a (1+3(...)), so from the innermost: 1. 1+3. Then each layer adds another. So the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3(Layer1). Up until Layer 9: 1+3(Layer8). So yes, 9 layers. So when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me check the computation of Layer 9 again because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So starting from the innermost, each layer is one more. So 1+3 is the innermost, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So 9 layers in total. So I think my computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So if I let L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on. So each layer Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's see. The recursive formula is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Let's see if this is a geometric sequence or something else. Let's compute the first few terms:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, same as before. So the recursive formula is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. Let's plug n=1: L1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for Layer 9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3*(L9) =3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the earlier computations. Let's go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric progression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that the solution is correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using a derived formula, the final result is found to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers.

So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or formula. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4. Wait, actually, L_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, correct. So, the general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let me try to find the particular solution. Assume L_n = C. Then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as starting with 3*(...), and each inner part is 1 + 3*(...), so maybe I can model the entire expression as a geometric series or something similar. But since I've already solved it step by step and confirmed with the recurrence relation, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.

So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer wraps around. Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, the first 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, moving out, each 1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let me write it out:\n\n3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3(\n1+3)))))))))))\n\nWait, so each time, it's 1+3(...), and each time, the number of layers increases by one. So starting from the innermost, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent ( is a new layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3. Each 1+3 is followed by a (, except the innermost one. Wait, let's see: The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then inside is 1+3(...). Each time, the inner expression is 1+3(...). So, each time, it's a new layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3 is followed by a (.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3(\nLayer 2: 1+3(\nLayer 3: 1+3(\nLayer 4: 1+3(\nLayer 5: 1+3(\nLayer 6: 1+3(\nLayer 7: 1+3(\nLayer 8: 1+3(\nLayer 9: 1+3\nThen, starting from Layer 9, it's 1+3, then Layer 8 is 1+3*(Layer 9), and so on up to Layer 1.\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers, each corresponding to each 1+3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the computation again because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication or addition.\n\nLet me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 29524 * 3 in another way. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nGiven that, we can see that this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has nine layers, it's probably faster to compute them step by step as I did earlier. But just for practice, let's see if we can find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nP = 1 + 3*P\n\nSolving for P:\n\nP - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test it with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both methods: computing step by step and using the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, resulting in the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nFinal result: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. How many layers are there in total? Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the first 3. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 has a closing parenthesis. Let me count the number of closing parentheses: Let's parse it step by step. Starting from the first 3, then (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.

Because each layer adds one closing parenthesis. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to count the number of layers.\n\nEach time I have a 1+3 followed by a (, that's a new layer. Let me parse the expression step by step:\n\nStart with 3(\n\nThen inside: 1 + 3(\n\nThen inside that: 1 + 3(\n\nThen: 1 + 3(\n\nThen: 1 + 3(\n\nThen: 1 + 3(\n\nThen: 1 + 3(\n\nThen: 1 + 3(\n\nThen: 1 + 3(\n\nThen: 1 + 3)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

How many? Let me see:\n\nFrom the expression, after 3(, there are 9 instances of 1+3( before the innermost 1+3. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first ( is after 3, then each 1+3 has another (.\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses is 1 (for the first 3()) plus 9 (for each 1+3(...)), but that might not be accurate because each 1+3(...) adds one more. Wait, actually, each time you have a 1+3(, that's an opening parenthesis. So, starting from the first 3(, that's one. Then each 1+3( adds another. Let me count:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, that's one.\n\nThen, each 1+3( is another.

But wait, the innermost part is 1+3), so that's the ninth opening parenthesis. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and the innermost is 1+3, which is the ninth layer.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Each time you have a 1+3(...), that's one layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then, the next layer is 1+3(layer1), that's layer2, and so on, up to layer9, which is the outermost one before the initial 3.\n\nSo, in total, there are 9 layers. That makes sense because the problem is structured as 3*(layer9), where layer9 is 1+3*(layer8), and so on down to layer1=1+3.\n\nSo, when I computed up to layer9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be the correct answer.

Yes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because 29524 * 3 is a big number, and I want to be absolutely sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, all the layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Starting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1. Then each subsequent \"(\" adds a layer. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each next is 1+3(...). So, the first is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3(Layer1). Layer3:1+3(Layer2), and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the entire expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the innermost is Layer1:1+3. Then Layer2:1+3(Layer1). Layer3:1+3(Layer2). Layer4:1+3(Layer3). Layer5:1+3(Layer4). Layer6:1+3(Layer5). Layer7:1+3(Layer6). Layer8:1+3(Layer7). Layer9:1+3(Layer8). And then the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, that's 9 layers. So, my previous computation was correct, going up to Layer9. So, the final computation is correct: 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Hmm, but wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times ...), so maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost: Each 1+3 is a separate layer. Let's count the opening parentheses. From the innermost, there are 9 opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to parse the expression properly. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3*(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1 + 3*(...) appears. Let's count: Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). So, the first innermost is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many 1 + 3*(...) are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(...). The first is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on until the ninth layer.

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. That's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + (a_0)*(r)^n, but wait, actually, that's for a geometric series, but here each term is defined based on the previous one. Wait, actually, the homogeneous solution and particular solution. Let me recall the formula. For a recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*( (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) ). Wait, let me check that. Yes, if we have a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation of the first order, the solution is given by a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*( (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) ). In our case, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. Wait, but in our case, the first term is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, here, r = 3, c = 1. The general solution would be a_n = (1/(1 - 3))*(3^{n} - 1) + a_0*3^{n}. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again. The standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. The solution is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*( (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) ). So, in our case, a_0 would be the initial term. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost term is a_1 = 4, so maybe a_0 is undefined? Alternatively, perhaps I should adjust the indices. Let me define a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is correct. So, using the formula: a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*( (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) ). Here, r = 3, c = 1, a_0 = 1. So, a_n = 3^{n}*1 + 1*( (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) ) = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Simplifying: Let's combine the terms. 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth term is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now that I've double-checked each step and even used the recurrence relation formula to confirm.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let's go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems to be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might help. Let me try to find a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's better to solve it using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula. That might have saved time, especially if the number of layers was larger, but for nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad, just a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 more than three times the previous layer, leading to the same recurrence relation. Either way, the answer comes out to 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the two methods agree.

Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step isn't too bad. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as n=1. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For each subsequent layer, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but perhaps for this problem, since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. However, just to check, maybe I can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence relation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer by Layer Calculation:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

That matches the earlier computation. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started from the innermost parentheses, which was 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed each layer step by step up to Layer 9, which gave me 29,524. Then I multiplied that by 3 to get 88,572. To be thorough, maybe I should check one or two layers to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's check Layer 3: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I've got the correct answer here. It's a bit tedious with all those layers, but taking it one step at a time worked well. I didn't see any shortcuts or formulas that could simplify this process because each layer depends on the previous one, so it really needed to be computed step by step. But breaking it down made it manageable. I guess another way to think about it is that each layer is a term in a geometric sequence or something, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about that for a moment. Suppose we have a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what we have here. So, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is known. In this case, k=3 and c=1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the linear recurrence. That's pretty cool. It shows how recognizing patterns and using recurrence relations can simplify the problem, especially when dealing with nested expressions. But even without knowing the formula, computing each layer step by step works fine, although it's a bit time-consuming. Either way, I arrive at the same answer, so I'm confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).

But just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let's think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This looks similar to a geometric series, but not exactly because each term is being multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Maybe it's a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I did before. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + (a_1)*(r)^{n-1}. Wait, actually, the standard solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + a_0*r^n, but in our case, the recurrence starts at a_1. Let me check the formula again. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*r^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = r*B + c => B - r*B = c => B*(1 - r) = c => B = c/(1 - r). So, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r). Applying initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*r^1 + c/(1 - r) = A*3 + 1/(1 - 3) = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n + (-1/2). Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Now, let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572. Which matches the result I obtained earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

So yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.

I think that's right, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's say, for example, if the expression was only two layers deep: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute that. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, computing step by step: 3(1 + 3(4)) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. So, using the same method, I get 39, which is correct. So, the method works on a smaller scale. Therefore, I can be confident that applying it to nine layers will give the correct result. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, but wait a minute, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) is the innermost, then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let's count how many layers there are. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then, each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous term. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. Let me recall the formula for such a recurrence. The recurrence is: a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r = 3 and c = 1 in this case. The general solution for such a recurrence is: a_n = A*r^n + (c/(r - 1)). Where A is a constant determined by the initial condition. Let's check that. So, for our case, r = 3, c = 1. So, the general solution would be: a_n = A*3^n + (1/(3 - 1)) = A*3^n + 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=0 corresponds to the innermost term, which is a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, no. Actually, when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the initial condition is a_1 = 4. Let me plug that into the general solution to find A. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + 1/2 = 3A + 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2. So, A = (7/2)/3 = 7/6. Therefore, the general formula is: a_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2. Let me simplify that: (7/6)*3^n = 7*(3^n)/6 = 7*(3^{n-1})/2. So, a_n = (7/2)*3^{n-1} + 1/2. Alternatively, combining the terms: a_n = (7*3^{n-1} + 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (7*3^{0} + 1)/2 = (7*1 + 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, that's our initial condition. Now, let's check n=2: a_2 = (7*3^{1} + 1)/2 = (21 + 1)/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier, when I computed Layer 2, I got 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, that can't be right. So, either my general formula is wrong, or I made a mistake in applying it. Let me check. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the initial condition. Because in the problem, the innermost term is a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, perhaps n=1 corresponds to the innermost, and the outermost layer is n=9. Let me see: If n=1, a_1 = 4. Using the formula, a_n = (7*3^{n-1} + 1)/2. For n=1: (7*3^{0} +1)/2 = (7 +1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (7*3^{1} +1)/2 = (21 +1)/2=22/2=11. But earlier, when I computed Layer 2, I got 13. So, something's wrong here. Wait, perhaps the formula isn't applicable here, or I made a mistake in deriving it. Let me go back. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms manually and see if I can find a pattern or derive the formula correctly. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so when n=2, a_2=13, but according to my formula, it's 11. That's a problem. So, my general solution must be incorrect. Let me try to derive it again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, matches my earlier computation.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct because both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result. To be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. 3^1=3\n3^2=9\n3^3=27\n3^4=81\n3^5=243\n3^6=729\n3^7=2187\n3^8=6561\n3^9=19683\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, 3^10 is indeed 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right.

It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me think about that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) => C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D => Simplify the right side: 3*C*3^{n-1} = C*3^n, and 3D. So, right side becomes 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Therefore, equation is: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose I define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw. Then, each subsequent term is built using the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer. Let's see if this recurrence relation can be solved. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We can find another equation by considering the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's substitute the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate the left and right sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: 3A + B = 4. Substitute B = -1/2: 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10} = 59049, so 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So the final result is 88572. Wait, but hold on. Let me check my earlier steps because I feel like maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and make sure each layer was computed correctly.

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the computation.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplying by 3 each time, which might give me a pattern or formula to compute it without calculating each layer step by step. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). There are nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me denote each layer as follows: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a3=1 +3*a2=1+39=40, and so on, up to a9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might help. Let's see if there's a pattern or a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. Let's write out the first few terms: a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. Hmm, I notice that each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The associated homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods, step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula, give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: The innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1+3(...), and the number of such layers is 9, as I initially thought. So, Layer 1: 1+3(1+3(...)) Wait, no, actually, when I started, I considered Layer 1 as the innermost 1+3, but perhaps each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, if I have 9 layers, then Layer 9 is the outermost one, which is multiplied by the initial 3. So, the computation is correct as above, leading to 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (since the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4). So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same answer, using the closed-form formula. That's probably more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for 9 layers, computing step by step isn't too bad. Alternatively, I could have recognized this as a geometric series. Each a_n can be expressed as a sum of a geometric progression. Let me see: Starting from a_1 =4, a_2=13=4*3 +1, a_3=13*3 +1=40, and so on. So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then an additional 1 is added. The formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, is actually the sum of a geometric series where the first term is 4 and the ratio is 3, but adjusted for the recurrence. Alternatively, the sum can be expressed as a_n = 3^n + 3^{n-1} + ... + 3^1 + something, but I think the formula we have is sufficient. In any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer to the problem.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it step by step. The homogeneous solution: The equation L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. From Layer 1: L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For Layer 1: n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: n=2, L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: n=3, L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. Layer 4: n=4, L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might help confirm the answer. Looking at each layer, the numbers are growing quite rapidly. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))), which is similar to a geometric series but nested. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the result. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049; 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is solid because I've computed it step by step, then used a recurrence relation approach to find a formula, and both methods led me to the same answer.

So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} - c/(1 - k), provided that k \u2260 1. Wait, let me check that formula. Alternatively, maybe it's better to solve it using iteration. Let me try to express a_n in terms of a_{n-1}, and so on. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\na_{n-1} = 1 + 3*a_{n-2}\nSubstituting, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 9*a_{n-2}\nSimilarly, a_{n-2} = 1 + 3*a_{n-3}\nSubstituting again, a_n = 1 + 3 + 9*(1 + 3*a_{n-3}) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27*a_{n-3}\nI see a pattern here. Each time, the coefficients are powers of 3, and the constants are the sum of powers of 3 up to a certain point.\n\nSo, in general, for a_n, after expanding, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n} * a_1\n\nWait, but a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, maybe I can express a_n as a sum of a geometric series plus some multiple of 3^n.\n\nLet me try to write out the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4 = 1 + 3\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27\nWait, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 is 40. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81.\n\nSo, it seems that a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k} + 3^{n+1} * a_1 ?\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nWait, for a_1, n=1: sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1.\n\nFor a_2, sum_{k=0}^{2} 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is a_2.\n\nFor a_3, sum_{k=0}^{3} 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is a_3.\n\nSo, it seems that a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k} = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3 is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nSo, yes, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, I can compute each layer directly without having to compute all the previous layers. That's a more efficient method, especially if there are many layers.\n\nIn this problem, since there are nine layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, and then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can efficiently compute the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This forms a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let a_n represent the value of the nth layer. The relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The recurrence can be solved using the formula for a geometric series. The sum of the series up to n terms is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Innermost Layer**: Starting from the innermost layer (n=1), each subsequent layer builds on the previous one.\n\n5. **Calculate the Outermost Layer**: For the outermost layer (n=9), compute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n6. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer, resulting in 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"
