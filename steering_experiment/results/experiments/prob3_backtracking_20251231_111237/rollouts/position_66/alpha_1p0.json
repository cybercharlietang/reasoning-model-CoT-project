Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct.

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then the final step: 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yeah, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here. Hmm, this looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Let me write down the recursive relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*c, but perhaps I can find the pattern. Alternatively, I can recognize that each a_n is of the form (3^n - 1)/2, but let me check that. Let me compute a_1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. But a_1 is 4, so that's not matching. Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute the values I have so far:\n\nn | a_n\n1 | 4\n2 | 13\n3 | 40\n4 | 121\n5 | 364\n6 | 1093\n7 | 3280\n8 | 9841\n9 | 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that can express a_n in terms of n. Let me see:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 13 = 4*3 + 1\na_3 = 40 = 13*3 + 1\na_4 = 121 = 40*3 + 1\na_5 = 364 = 121*3 + 1\na_6 = 1093 = 364*3 + 1\na_7 = 3280 = 1093*3 + 1\na_8 = 9841 = 3280*3 + 1\na_9 = 29524 = 9841*3 + 1\n\nSo, each a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Wait, but that's the same as the original recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, that's consistent. Now, to solve this recurrence relation, we can find the closed-form solution. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both by computing each layer step by step and by finding the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(previous), etc.\n\n3. After computing up to the ninth layer, multiply by 3 as per the original expression.\n\n4. To verify, recognize the recurrence relation and solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\n5. Confirm that the closed-form formula gives the same result as step-by-step computation.\n\n6. Multiply the final layer result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nThroughout this process, I made sure to double-check each computation, especially when dealing with large numbers, to avoid arithmetic errors. It's easy to make a mistake when multiplying large numbers, so breaking it down digit by digit helps prevent errors. Additionally, recognizing the recurrence relation provided a way to verify the result without manually computing each layer, which is especially useful if the problem had more layers.\n\nIn summary, the key steps were:\n\n- Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n- Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation.\n\n- Solving the recurrence to find a closed-form expression.\n\n- Verifying the result using both step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula.\n\n- Multiplying the final result by 3 as required by the original expression.\n\nThis methodical approach ensures that I don't overlook any steps and that the final answer is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to find the result efficiently. The final computation involves multiplying the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the nested structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). We compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Recognize the recurrence relation**: Each layer follows the relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Apply the formula for n=9**: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, but let me verify each layer step by step again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} for n >= 2, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\nFor n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\nFor n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\nFor n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\nFor n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed as a recurrence relation, leading to a formula for the nth layer. Using this approach, the final result is computed as follows:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) = 88572$\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer computation because if any layer was wrong, the whole thing would be off. So, let's go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost as Layer 1 up to Layer 9. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, I got 88,572. So, that should be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88,572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Hmm, so where did I go wrong? Let me try the multiplication again. 29524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

So, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again. Layer 6 was 1093, so Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. That's correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something that can be expressed in a closed-form formula. Let me explore that.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check with n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula works. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is Layer 1, n=1: a_1=4. Each subsequent layer increases n by 1, up to Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, since the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, because a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Then, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result as before. So, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but I think the recurrence approach was more straightforward here.\n\nSo, to sum up, by computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, I arrived at the final result of 88572. I also verified it using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, which gave me the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each subsequent layer's value. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer's value by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step:**  \n    Multiply Layer 9 by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous. Let me denote L1=1+3=4, L2=1+3*L1=1+12=13, L3=1+3*L2=40, etc. It looks like each term is 3 times the previous term minus 2? Let me check: L2=13, which is 3*4 +1=13. Wait, no, 3*4=12, plus 1 is 13. Similarly, L3=1 + 3*13=40, which is 3*13 +1=40. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is that it's a geometric series. Let me see. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 +1. The homogeneous solution is Ln^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume Ln^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the equation: C = 3*C +1 => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1: L1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, Ln= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, Ln= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so 3^{10} -1 over 2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. I think this method is more efficient because it uses the formula instead of computing each layer step by step, especially when dealing with many layers. It's good to recognize the pattern and apply the formula to save time. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, yes, 88572. So, putting it all together, each layer was computed by taking the previous layer's result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and so on. So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1 was 4, then Layer 2 was 13, Layer 3 was 40, Layer 4 was 121, Layer 5 was 364, Layer 6 was 1093, Layer 7 was 3280, Layer 8 was 9841, Layer 9 was 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. Let me verify this because the numbers are getting large, and it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3: Layer 1\n\nThen, moving out, each 1+3(...) is a new layer.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, which is 9 times. So, 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is the outermost one, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nCompute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows a geometric progression. Since each term is 1 + 3*previous term, it's similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but with an added constant each time. The formula I derived earlier accounts for that.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by expanding all the terms, but that seems messy. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series might help, but since each term depends on the previous one multiplied by 3 and adding 1, the recurrence relation seems the right approach.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in computing the layers, let me recompute a few:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, multiplying the final layer by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we find the outermost layer and multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my steps because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long calculation. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that all checks out. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substitute back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer n is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, which is the outermost layer: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Wait, that's different from 87572. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in my earlier multiplication. Let me try again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

So, the correct multiplication is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial digit-by-digit calculation, I thought the digits were 2,9,5,2,4, but actually, 29524 is:\n\n- 2 (ten thousands)\n- 9 (thousands)\n- 5 (hundreds)\n- 2 (tens)\n- 4 (units)\n\nSo, when I did the multiplication:\n\n- Units: 4 *3 =12, write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten thousands:2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units).

But let me double-check my layers because perhaps I made a mistake in computing one of the layers.\n\nWait, let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, yes, Layer 9 is the one we need to compute, and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but when I first started, I thought the innermost was 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous part: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. Its characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula, let me check n=10, even though it's not needed here.\n\na_10=(3^11 -1)/2=(177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573. Hmm, interesting, that's one more than our final answer, which makes sense because a_10 would be the next layer.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we only go up to a_9, so 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3\\) times the result of Layer 9:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me write it out properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    x        3\n    ------------\n      8 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, no, that's not right because 29524 * 3: Let me compute it step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. Hmm, but wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then subtract (30,000 - 29,524) which is 476, so 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Wait, that's different. So I must have made a mistake in my digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check again:\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, so write 2, carry 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the number would be 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87,572. But when I did the alternative method, I got 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88,572, which means I must have made a mistake in my digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write 29524 as:\n\nDigit positions: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nMultiplying each by 3:\n\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, writing from the last multiplication to the first: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,572. So, my initial digit-by-digit calculation was correct, but when I wrote it out, I might have misaligned the digits. So, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I added 29524 three times, I got 88,572, which matches this. So, I must have made a mistake in my first digit-by-digit calculation by misplacing the digits. So, the correct final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back to the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me recount each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe this forms a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me consider the expression as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, and then a particular solution is found.\n\nAlternatively, since the recurrence is linear and has constant coefficients, we can solve it using iteration.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n^{(h)} = 3*a_{n-1}^{(h)}.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolve for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Good.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing from the top: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, but that's 88,572, which is correct. So, yes, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the answer is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nTo verify, we use the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\).

Correct.\n\nMultiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially since this might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about it.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as n=1 up to n=9. Then, the recurrence relation would be:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, for n >= 2.\n\nWith a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me check that.\n\nActually, the recurrence is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. In our case, c=3, d=1. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula confirms that the result is indeed 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward, computing each layer by substituting the result of the previous layer into the next one. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result of the previous layer)}\\). After computing the innermost layer, we proceed outward until we reach the outermost layer.

Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's more of a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let's denote a_n as the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the next inner term.

So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without doing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me represent each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, that seems correct? Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 can be broken down as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that's different. Wait, 30000 \u00d7 3 = 90000. 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 90000 - (476 \u00d7 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. But earlier, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572. There's a discrepancy here. So, which one is correct? Let me add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add 29524 + 29524 first:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\nAdding units: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nTens: 2 + 2 = 4\n\nHundreds: 5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carryover 1\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carryover 1\n\nTen-thousands: 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\nNow, add another 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from units: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carryover 1\n\nTens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nHundreds: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carryover 1\n\nTen-thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. So, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong. I must have messed up the digits somewhere. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, when I did the digit-by-digit:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result should be 87572. But when adding, it's 88572. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing down. Let me write it properly:\n\n       2 9 5 2 4\n     \u00d7        3\n     ------------\n       ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 units place: 2, carryover 1\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7 \u2192 tens place: 7, carryover 0\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place: 5, carryover 1\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28 \u2192 thousands place: 8, carryover 2\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8 \u2192 ten-thousands place: 8\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88572, not 87572. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous step when I thought the digits were 87572. So, actually, it's 88572. So, my initial digit-by-digit was correct when I thought it was 87572, but then I confused the digits when I was trying to write it out. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if Layer 9 is incorrect, then the final answer would be wrong. So, let's go back step by step and verify each layer.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88572, as verified by both multiplication and addition. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try to compute it another way. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something similar. Because this expression seems to be a geometric progression.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, if I let x = 1 + 3x, that would be a recursive formula, but in this case, it's finite, with nine layers. So, maybe it's a finite geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9 = 1 + 3*L8. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a9.\n\nSo, let's compute the terms:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as before, a9 = 29524, and the expression is 3*a9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a1 = 4. So, when n=1, a1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9: a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. All steps check out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThen, moving out: 1 +3*(4)=13.\n\nEach time, it's 1 +3 times the previous term.\n\nSo, the sequence is 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of each term as a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, then the expression is 3*a9, where a9=29524.\n\nBut I think I've verified this enough times. The answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make absolutely sure, I'll compute 29524*3 using another method. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the calculations multiple times, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 87572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct total is 88572, not 87572. Let me check my digit-by-digit multiplication again: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. That matches the sum of the parts. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because if I messed up any of the layers, the final answer will be wrong. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that formula for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\na_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4. Then Layer 2 is a_2 = 13, and so on up to Layer 9, which is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, both methods agree. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've got it right. The key was to recognize the recurrence relation and compute each layer step by step, then verify using the formula. It's a bit tedious, but breaking it down made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find the solution step by step.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, but when I did 29524 * 3 earlier, I thought of it as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, but that's not correct. Actually, 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1. So, 29524 * 3 = (2*10000)*3 + (9*1000)*3 + (5*100)*3 + (2*10)*3 + (4*1)*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.

So, 88572. Wait, that's different from the 87572 I thought earlier. So, which one is correct?

So, my initial digit-by-digit calculation was correct, but I must have miscounted the digits earlier. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I computed each layer correctly. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought of the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought 29524*3 was 88572, but when I broke it down into place values, I got 88572 as well. So, that seems consistent.\n\nLet me just double-check the multiplication once more to be absolutely sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula, but given the time constraints, I think the step-by-step computation is the most straightforward method here.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me try to find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have an expression like x = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...))). If there are n layers, then x can be expressed recursively as x = 1 + 3*x, which is a linear recurrence relation. Solving this, we can find x = (1)/(1 - 3) but wait, that would be for an infinite series, but here we have a finite number of layers. Alternatively, for a finite number of terms, the expression can be represented as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to express Layer k in terms of Layer k-1. Let's denote L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as I computed earlier. So, each layer is 1 plus three times the previous layer. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve for A and B. We have L_k = 3*L_{k-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_k^h = A*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_k^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For k=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer k is (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which is much faster. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as \\( L_k = 1 + 3L_{k-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\). Using the formula \\( L_k = \\frac{3^{k+1} - 1}{2} \\), we find \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but given that each layer is just 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a linear recurrence. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to this recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is small (only nine), computing each step manually is feasible. However, for a larger number of layers, we might want to find a closed-form expression. Let me see if I can derive a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88,572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Subtract (30,000 - 29524) = 476, so 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me verify my earlier steps because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount each layer to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

But wait, let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: Each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers? Let me count the opening parentheses. Each \"1+3(\" introduces a new layer. Let's see: The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of layers: Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting after the first \"3(\", there are 9 sets of \"1 + 3(\", each nested inside the previous. So, that means there are 9 layers, right? So, my earlier calculation up to Layer 9 is correct. So, each step is correct, so Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, for n >= 2, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Which matches my earlier calculation of a_2=13. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we have n=9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this, it's a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to write it out. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) If I expand this, each term inside is 3^k for k from 0 to 9, but I need to think carefully. Wait, actually, each time you have 1 + 3*(...), so when you expand, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)). So, each layer adds another term. Let me try to see the pattern. Let's start with the innermost term: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous. So, in terms of powers of 3, let's see:\n\nAt layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\nWait, 3^1 +1=4, yes.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 1 + 3^1? Wait, 3^2=9, 9 + 3 +1=13. Yes, that's correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 +1? Wait, 27 +9 +3 +1=40. Yes.\n\nWait, so each layer is the sum of 3^k from k=0 to k=n, where n is the layer number. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is layer 1: 3^1 +1=4. Then layer 2: 3^2 +3^1 +1=13. Layer 3: 3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1=40. So, in general, layer n: sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Wait, but sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9: sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))), with nine layers, then expanding E would give me a sum of 3^{10} + 3^9 + ... + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0, but multiplied by 3? Wait, no. Let me think carefully.\n\nWait, actually, each time you have E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, expanding E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) which is 3*1 + 3*(3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3 + 9*(1 + 3*(...)), and so on. But perhaps it's more straightforward to recognize that each layer is a sum of powers of 3, as we saw earlier.\n\nIn any case, since we've already computed it step by step and confirmed with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so 29524 * 3 = 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems right, but let me check if there's a pattern here or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. I recall that expressions like this can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9, since the outermost 3 is multiplied by the ninth layer.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then,\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtracting A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check if the closed-form formula is correctly applied. Since a_1 is the first layer, which is 4, and according to the formula, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Similarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Which matches layer 2. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see: Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this way, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. Wait, but a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so perhaps a_0 would be 1? Let me check.\n\nIf I set a_0 =1, then a_1 =1 +3*a_0=1 +3*1=4. Correct. Then, a_2=1 +3*a_1=1 +3*4=13. So, the general formula would be a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_0=1.\n\nSo, expanding this, a_n=1 +3*(1 +3*a_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2*a_{n-2}.\n\nContinuing, a_n=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3*a_{n-3}.\n\nThis pattern continues until a_n=1 +3 +3^2 +... +3^{n} +3^{n+1}*a_0.\n\nBut a_0=1, so a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as before. So, same result.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step and then applying the outermost multiplication by 3, we find the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. There are nine layers, starting from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer to make sure I didn't skip a step or miscalculate. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can think of the expression as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3, so perhaps the sum can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me explore that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me denote the innermost part as S. Then, each layer adds another 1 + 3*S, but this might not directly form a geometric series because each layer is nested within the previous one. However, using the recurrence approach seems more straightforward in this case. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, I find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find the value step by step. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\), repeated nine times, and then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me write it properly: 29524 multiplied by 3.\n\nBreaking down 29524:\n- 2 (ten thousands place)\n- 9 (thousands place)\n- 5 (hundreds place)\n- 2 (tens place)\n- 4 (units place)\n\nMultiplying each by 3:\n\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- Thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n- Ten thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it from the top: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,752? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because 29524 is 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3: Let me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then subtract (476 * 3) because 30,000 - 29,524 = 476. So, 476 * 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I multiplied digit by digit, I got 87,572, which is different. So, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. So, units place is 2, carryover 1.\n- Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place is 7, carryover 0.\n- Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.\n- Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place is 8, carryover 2.\n- Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten thousands place is 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,752, but that's not matching the previous method. Wait, but 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048; 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. So, 88,572 is correct. Therefore, my digit-by-digit multiplication must have been wrong earlier. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write 29,524 as:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nSo, each digit:\n\n- 4 (units)\n- 2 (tens)\n- 5 (hundreds)\n- 9 (thousands)\n- 2 (ten thousands)\n\nSo, when multiplying by 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, the digits from right to left are: 2,7,5,8,8. So, writing them as a number: 8 8 7 5 2, which is 88,752. But that contradicts the earlier result of 88,572. So, I must have made a mistake in my previous calculation. Wait, let me compute 29,524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Total so far: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 Total: 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 Total: 88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 Total: 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nAh, there we go. So, the correct result is 88,572. So, my digit-by-digit method was wrong earlier because I misaligned the digits. The correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but according to my layer-by-layer computation, Layer 9 was 29,524, and 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nLet me recap the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is correctly computed.\n\nThen, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1)\n3. 1 + 3*(2)\n...\nWait, no, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I have nine layers, then Layer 9 is the outermost. So, my earlier computation is correct.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1 + 3(\n2. Then another ( after that: 1 + 3(\n3. And so on, until the last one is 1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1 + 3(...) occurs. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, each layer is wrapped in another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 9. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, that would mean there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my earlier computation of 9 layers is correct, ending at Layer 9 = 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just verify that with a smaller example to make sure my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) Let's compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, let's compute it step by step:\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nThen, outermost: 3*(40) = 120\n\nWhich is correct because 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem should be correct.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by breaking down the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's say we have a function f(n) where each layer adds another 3*(f(n-1)). Wait, but in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I did earlier. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume f_p(n) = B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, f(1)=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: f(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: f(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, f(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*f(9)=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Wait, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost parentheses, I computed each layer step by step up to the ninth layer, which gave me 29524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get 88572. Additionally, I used a formula for the recurrence relation to confirm that the ninth layer is indeed 29524, which matched my step-by-step computation. Then, multiplying by 3 gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step and then multiplying the final result by 3, we find the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next layer})\\). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the final layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

It looks like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4  \na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1  \na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2  \n...  \na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8  \n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1  \nC - 3C = 1  \n-2C = 1  \nC = -1/2  \n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)  \n4 = 3A - 1/2  \n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2  \n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using both methods, I get the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. But wait, let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series, but given that each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's more of a recursive sequence. Let me think if there's a formula for such a sequence. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, then this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a first-order linear recurrence, the solution can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which confirms that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, computing each layer step by step as I did initially is also a valid approach, though more time-consuming. Either way, the answer is the same. So, I feel confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572, not 87572. Wait, but 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572 because 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. So I must have made a mistake in my initial digit-by-digit calculation. Probably, I misaligned the digits. So, the correct multiplication is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*(29524) = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524.\n\nSo Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help compute this without having to calculate each layer individually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then the expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see if the sequence a_n follows a particular pattern.\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 13\n\na_3 = 40\n\na_4 = 121\n\na_5 = 364\n\na_6 = 1093\n\na_7 = 3280\n\na_8 = 9841\n\na_9 = 29524\n\nHmm, let me see if each term is related to powers of 3. Let's compute 3^n for n from 1 to 9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nNow, let's see if a_n is related to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute (3^{n+1} -1)/2 for n=1 to 9:\n\nn=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. That's a_1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. That's a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. That's a_3=40.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. That's a_4=121.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. That's a_5=364.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. That's a_6=1093.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. That's a_7=3280.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. That's a_8=9841.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's a_9=29524.\n\nWow, so it seems that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. That's a neat formula! So, in general, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nThat's a useful pattern. So, if I can express a_n in terms of 3^{n+1}, I can compute it more quickly without having to go through each layer step by step. But since in this problem, we only have 9 layers, it's manageable to compute each step, but it's good to know the formula for future reference.\n\nGiven that, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So that's another way to compute it using the formula.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me verify each step again.\n\nFirst, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 holds for each layer. So, for n=1 to 9, a_n is as computed. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the entire expression: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nBoth methods give the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward and verifying with a closed-form formula, I arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the pattern a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2. Applying this formula up to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is defined as a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting with a\u2081 = 4.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - a\u2081 = 4\n   - a\u2082 = 13\n   - a\u2083 = 40\n   - a\u2084 = 121\n   - a\u2085 = 364\n   - a\u2086 = 1093\n   - a\u2087 = 3280\n   - a\u2088 = 9841\n   - a\u2089 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the formula**: a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 87572. Wait, let me verify that. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6.

So, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 87572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 87572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's recursive, where each term is defined as 1 + 3*term. That seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for the nth term. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier results to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=87572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Wait, that's different from the 87572 I got earlier. Hmm, that's a problem. There must be a mistake here. Wait, hold on. Let me check this. If the expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is indeed 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144 divided by 2 is 88572. But earlier, I computed 3*29524=87572, which is different. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check the formula again. The general solution was a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Correct. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=87572. But according to the formula, 3*a_9 should be (3^{11} -3)/2=88572. So, which one is correct? There must be an error in the formula approach. Let me see. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Because the expression is 3*a_9, but a_9 itself is already computed as 1 + 3*a_8, so maybe the formula needs to account for the fact that the outermost 3 is multiplying the entire expression. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but the initial approach of computing each layer step by step is wrong. Let me check that again. Wait, when I computed 3*29524, I got 87572, but according to the formula, it should be 88572. So, I must have made a mistake in either the step-by-step computation or in the formula. Let me recompute 3*29524. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Oh! I see where I messed up earlier. When I computed 29524*3, I thought it was 87572, but actually, it's 88572. So, my initial step-by-step computation was wrong because I miscalculated 29524*3. So, the correct final answer should be 88572, which aligns with the formula approach. Therefore, I must have made an arithmetic error when I first multiplied 29524 by 3. Let me correct that. So, going back, the step-by-step layers are correct up to Layer 9 being 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the correct final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, both methods agree now. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. I must have made a mistake in my initial multiplication, probably due to a calculation error. It's a good reminder to always double-check my work, especially when dealing with large numbers. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I arrived at the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Final Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Let's break down 29,524 into parts:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nNow, multiply each part by 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscount them. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses. I computed up to Layer 9, so that's correct. Each layer was computed correctly, as I checked each step. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find the value of each layer step by step. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   Compute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost Layer):**  \n   1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\n10. **Final Step:**  \n    Multiply the outermost result by 3:  \n    3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."
