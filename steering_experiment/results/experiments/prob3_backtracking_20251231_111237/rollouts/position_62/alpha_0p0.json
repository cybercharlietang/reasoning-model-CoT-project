    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears inside each other. Each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(...), so each layer adds one. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, so each step adds another layer. From the expression, it's 3(1 + 3(...)), and inside each 3(...) there's another 1 + 3(...), so each time we go one layer deeper. So, if I have 3(1 + 3(...)), and inside that 3(...), there's another 3(1 + 3(...)), so each layer is one more. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, we have another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). And so on, until Layer 9. Wait, because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Wait, let me check the original problem again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. It's 9 opening parentheses, each followed by 1+3(...). So, that would mean 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but when I counted the layers, I thought each layer was a 1 + 3*(...), so the first layer is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, if there are 9 layers, then the final result is 3*(Layer9). So, I think my calculation is correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can try computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's say I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this using my method. Innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, the expression is 3*40 = 120. Let me compute it manually: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, my method works for a smaller version. Therefore, I can be confident that my calculation for the original problem is correct, resulting in 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, perhaps using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is linear and has constant coefficients, so we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 87572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. So, I think I did it right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. I wonder if this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that works. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula also gives the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048.

But let me double-check my earlier computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That sounds like a geometric series or something similar. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 ... Up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern in the layers without computing each one step by step. Let me see the values I got for each layer: L1:4, L2:13, L3:40, L4:121, L5:364, L6:1093, L7:3280, L8:9841, L9:29524. I can see that each L_n is 3*L_{n-1} +1. So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, starting from 4, each term is 3*prev +1. So, the formula I derived earlier, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, fits this. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me denote the innermost expression as x, then each layer is 1 + 3x, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3x), and so on. But perhaps expanding it would be too time-consuming. Alternatively, since each layer is a linear function of the previous, the closed-form formula is the most efficient way. So, with L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's another way to look at it. So, 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572. That's consistent with the earlier calculations. So, regardless of the method, the answer seems to be 88572.

Wait, let me check that again. Let me write it out: 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.

Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n= (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20,000 \u00d7 3 + 9,000 \u00d7 3 + 500 \u00d7 3 + 20 \u00d7 3 + 4 \u00d7 3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I'm a bit confused. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. But let me make sure I computed each layer correctly.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.

Correct.\n\nSo, yes, Layer 9 is 29,524, and 3 times that is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer manually. Let's think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n as the value at the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nWe can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, expanding it all the way, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is a_9, which we've computed as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAnother way to verify is to compute the expression step by step using a calculator, but since I'm doing it manually, I think I've double-checked enough to be certain.\n\nSo, in summary, by computing each nested layer step by step and then using a closed-form formula to verify, I've determined that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of parentheses. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this, we determine the value of the outermost expression and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested form where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. But let me check Layer 7 again because 3*1093 is 3279, right? 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3280 *3=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 9841*3=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might make the computation faster. Each layer seems to follow the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1=4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. If I can find a general formula for Layer n, that might help. Let me think about it. This is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard form is a_n + c1*a_{n-1} + ... = f(n). In this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's rearrange it: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the general formula, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the general formula, I arrive at the same answer.

So, writing it all together, we get 88572.

Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer because sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might save time. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be written as: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9). So, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. First, 3^{10} is 59049. So, 3^{10} = 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, we can compute 3*a_9 as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that it's correct. So, I think I've solved the problem correctly.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then I multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Let me just double-check my earlier computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that looks correct. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, yes, nine layers in total. So, Layer 9 is the outermost one, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula to make sure.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=4, correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, correct.\n\nSo, all layers match the formula. Therefore, the final computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern initially, I could have kept computing each layer step by step as I did before, which also led me to the correct result. It's reassuring to see that both methods converge to the same answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series. The formula we derived earlier is a concise way to represent the nth term without having to compute each layer individually, which is especially useful for larger n.\n\nIn summary, by either iteratively computing each layer or by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, we arrive at the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4.

Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, all layers seem correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Sometimes, when you have a nested expression like this, you can model it as a geometric series or find a pattern that allows you to compute it without expanding each layer. Let me see if that's possible here. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, let's see if there's a pattern or a formula for a_n. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since n is small (only 9), it's easier to compute each term step by step as I did earlier. So, the approach I took initially is valid. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572. Just to make sure, I'll compute 3*29524 again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. 5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. 6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. 7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. 8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. 9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. 10. Finally, multiplied by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Each layer is computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Each time, I multiplied by 3 and added 1, which seems consistent. Let me check one of the layers again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's pick Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121. So Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That looks right. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. I think I've done this correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing all together, we have 8,8,7,5,7,2. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, the number is 29524, so digits are 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each by 3:\n\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check with another method: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nAdding 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check my earlier computations because I might have made a mistake in calculating the layers. Let me go back step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct, and then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There's one after the first 3, then each subsequent layer adds another. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen each layer wraps around that, so each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1 + 3(...) repeats. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nI think I can count the number of 3(...) sections. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to how many?\n\nLooking at the original expression, after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). Wait, no. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on until the innermost.\n\nI think there are 9 layers because each time you have 1 + 3(...), and the innermost is 1 + 3, so that's 9 layers. Wait, let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 1 + 3.\n\nSo, my earlier computation up to Layer 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again because when I computed Layer 7 as 3280, that's 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas.\n\nLet me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nWe can write this as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's substitute into the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the equation:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n-2B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1:\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the recursive pattern, I could have computed each layer step by step as I did initially, and it still gives the same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result now.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, let me check that again because 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12.

Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093 as Layer 6, but that's correct. 3*364 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. So 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 7: 3,280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000, 280*3=840. So 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.

So, after carefully checking each layer, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations because each step built upon the previous one correctly.

So putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, let me check that again: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, so 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, so 7, carry 0. Next: 5*3=15, so 5, carry 1.

Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.

Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*next_layer. So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 =1 +3=4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. I can also check the number of layers. Since each set of parentheses adds another layer, and the original expression has 9 sets, so n=9. Therefore, the formula gives a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and 3*a_9=88572. Yep, that seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes here, as both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next term)}\\).

So yes, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check each layer computation to make sure I didn't make any errors earlier on.

Another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula for expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...))). But in this case, since it's only nine layers, computing each step is feasible. So, to recap, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Wait, but let me go back to the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me recast the problem as a series of nested expressions and compute each step again to verify. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let me assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Now, equate coefficients: For 3^n: C = C, which is always true. For constants: D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually. Let's see, when n=1: a1=4, as we saw. n=2: a2=1 + 3*4=13, correct. n=3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. n=4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. n=5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. n=6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. n=7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. n=8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. n=9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that's a lot of steps, and I might have made an error in one of the layers.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer step by step. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem is correctly interpreted. The original problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, it's 3*(...), where the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 3*(...). So, with nine layers, each time adding 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I think my computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed as a geometric series or using a formula. Let me think about that.\n\nIn general, if you have an expression like x = 1 + 3x, then solving for x gives x = (1)/(1 - 3) = -1/2, but that's for an infinite series. However, in our case, the expression is finite, with nine layers. So, perhaps we can model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1\n\nSo, L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. To ensure, maybe I can compute it another way or check the number of layers again.\n\nWait, the original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer, and the last one ends with \"1 + 3)))))\", so how many layers?\n\nStarting from the innermost: Each time you see a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each adding another \"1 + 3(\" until the 9th layer, which is the outermost. So, yes, L_9 is the correct layer to compute, and then multiply by 3.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of terms where each term is 1 + 3 times the next nested term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait a minute, these numbers look familiar. 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524... I think these are related to the powers of 3 or something similar. Let me see: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. Hmm, but the layers are 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524. These numbers are each one more than a multiple of 3^n. For example, L_1=4=1+3^1. L_2=13=1+3*4=1+3*(1+3)=1+3+9=13. Alternatively, 13=3^3 - 2^3 + something? Wait, maybe another approach. Let me see if L_n satisfies a recurrence relation. From the way it's built, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, that's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values we have. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's correct, which matches our earlier computation. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(...), etc. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there?

Layer8 is 9841. So Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: 29524 * 3.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that.\n\nIn general, if you have a term like x = 1 + 3x', where x' is the next layer, and this repeats n times, then each layer is x_k = 1 + 3x_{k-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for x_k = 1 + 3x_{k-1} with x_0 = 1 (if we start counting from the innermost layer) would be x_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, let's see. Let's model the recurrence relation: x_k = 1 + 3x_{k-1}, with x_0 = 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is x^{(h)}_k = C * 3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say x^{(p)}_k = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is x_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition x_0 = 1:\n\nx_0 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 1 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nThus, x_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer k, x_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers. Let's see if this formula works for the layers we computed.\n\nFor example, Layer 1: k=1, x_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: k=2, x_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: k=3, x_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: k=4, x_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: k=5, x_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: k=6, x_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: k=7, x_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: k=8, x_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: k=9, x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula checks out. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 times x_9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3 * x_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's another way to compute it, which confirms the result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for such a recurrence, we determine that the outermost expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))). There are nine layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1) and moving outward, each layer is computed as:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3(4) = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3(13) = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3(40) = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3(121) = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3(364) = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, writing it all together: 8 (from the first digit), then 8, 7, 5, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572.

Wait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3 occur? Let's count the number of closing parentheses. Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1+3 appears. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. So, Layer 1: innermost 1+3=4 Layer 2: next 1+3*(Layer1)=13 Layer3: 1+3*(Layer2)=40 Layer4: 1+3*(Layer3)=121 Layer5: 1+3*(Layer4)=364 Layer6: 1+3*(Layer5)=1093 Layer7: 1+3*(Layer6)=3280 Layer8: 1+3*(Layer7)=9841 Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8)=29524 Then, 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after double-checking each step, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which would have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such nested expressions.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and it might give a direct formula to compute a_n without having to compute each layer step by step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the first few layers to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nThis method is much faster and reduces the chance of calculation errors, especially for larger n. But since I already computed each layer step by step and arrived at the same result, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've considered all possible angles here. I broke down the problem, solved it step by step, checked each layer, derived a general formula to confirm the result, and even tested the formula against known values. Everything adds up correctly. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. In general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c), but maybe it's easier to recognize the pattern. Let me compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, the terms are growing exponentially, which makes sense since each term is multiplied by 3 each time. So, the general formula for a_n can be expressed as a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me test this for n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that's not matching. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me see: Let's consider the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since in this problem, there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. However, it's good to know that there's a formula here to save time in case of a larger expression. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, we found that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the layers step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in the computation. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, if I consider the entire expression as 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me cross-verify to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Maybe I miscalculated one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the number of layers again because I might have miscounted. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. So starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time there's a 1+3(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, from the innermost, the layers are: Layer 1: 1+3 Layer 2: 1+3(...) Layer 3: 1+3(...) ... Up to Layer 9, as I did earlier. So, yes, 9 layers. So, my calculation is correct, leading to 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way. Let me consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as I did before. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, we can compute a_2, a_3, ..., a_9, and then the final result is 3*a_9. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. In this case, c = 3, d = 1. So, the general formula would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) * 1. But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so perhaps a_0 would be 1? Let me see: If n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. So, 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. So, using the formula: a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2 * 1. Therefore, a_n = 3^n * 1 + (3^n -1)/2 = 3^n + (3^n -1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n -1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I have: For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Because computing each layer step by step is time-consuming and prone to error, especially with nine layers. Maybe there's a geometric series or something here. Let me think about it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me denote the entire expression as E. But in this case, the expression isn't exactly E = 3*(1 + E), because the innermost term is just 1 + 3, not 1 + 3*E. So, perhaps it's a finite geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*... So, perhaps each layer can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that would be helpful. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the result I obtained by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach corroborates the step-by-step computation.

Because starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers. So, maybe there's a general formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me recall that for such expressions, each layer can be represented recursively. Let's define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and then a_{k+1} = 1 + 3*a_k. So, the recurrence relation is a_{k+1} = 3*a_k + 1. That's a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_k^h = A*3^{k}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_k^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_k = A*3^{k} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When k = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer k, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For k=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For k=4: a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for layer k=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, it's equivalent to 3*a_9, which we've computed as 88572. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this, maybe by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series or something else. Hmm, each layer is 1 + 3*previous, which is similar to a geometric series but with an added constant each time. But since I've already found the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation, and it checks out with the step-by-step computation, I think I'm confident that the answer is correct. So, to recap: Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, I found the innermost layer to be 4, then 13, then 40, and so on, up to the 9th layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value before multiplying by 3 is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So writing it all together, starting from the top: 8 (from the last digit), then 8, then 7, then 5, then 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 *3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes: 1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. 3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. 4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. 5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. 6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. 7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. 8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. 9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. 10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Each step seems logical, and the computations check out. I don't think I made any arithmetic errors, but let me verify a couple of layers to be sure. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've solved it correctly. Each layer builds on the previous one, and the numbers get quite large as we go outward, which is why the final result is so big. It's interesting how each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which seems to follow a pattern similar to a geometric series, but because it's nested, it's a bit more involved. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Maybe something like a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, solving this recurrence relation could give a closed-form solution, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. However, for a larger number of layers, it would be more efficient to find a general formula. But that's beyond the scope of this problem. For now, I'm confident that my step-by-step computation is correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, yes, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we saw earlier. Now, to find a closed-form expression, let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have n=9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Compute the innermost expression:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Work outward layer by layer:**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 1} & : 1 + 3 = 4 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 2} & : 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3} & : 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4} & : 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5} & : 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6} & : 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7} & : 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8} & : 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9} & : 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me make sure that I correctly computed each layer. Let me recheck each step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially since it's a nested expression with the same structure. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something that can be modeled recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, such that f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the outermost expression would be 3*f(9). So, let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for f(n). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 1. Wait, no, actually, the recurrence is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), whose solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form f_p(n) = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as we saw earlier. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524=88572, which matches what I computed earlier. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to go through each layer. That's much more efficient, especially for larger n. But since in this problem, n=9, it's manageable either way. So, to recap, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer can be represented as f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, f(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive formula, we find that each layer can be expressed as f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, f(9)=29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that would be 88572? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in computation. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, when I compute Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's correct. Each time, I'm substituting the innermost expression with its value. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the outermost layer is a_9, and the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, I can compute a_2, a_3, ..., a_9 using this recurrence. Let me compute them again to confirm: a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that's the same as before. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it's a non-homogeneous one because of the constant term 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, or use the recurrence relation, or the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So putting it all together, starting from the right: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, that gives 88572. Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Wait, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(...), so maybe I need to check whether I correctly accounted for all the layers. Let me count the number of layers. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of (1+3(...)), each nested within the previous one. So, I think I correctly computed up to Layer 9, then multiplied by 3. Alternatively, perhaps the expression is structured differently. Wait, let me parse the expression more carefully. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, yes, I think I did nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but I feel like 88572 is a big number, but given the multiple layers, it might be correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, expanding this, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to express E in terms of itself. Wait, but since each layer is similar, perhaps I can find a pattern. Let me see: Let me define E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4=12. Wait, but in our problem, we have nine layers, so E_9. Alternatively, perhaps I can model E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), with E_1=3*(1+3)=12. Wait, but in our earlier approach, a_n was the inner expression before multiplying by 3. So, perhaps E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), starting with E_1=3*(1 +3)=12. Wait, but in our initial calculation, Layer 1 was 4, then Layer 2 was 13, etc., up to Layer 9 being 29524, and then E = 3*Layer9=88572. Alternatively, if I model E_n as 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), starting from E_1=3*(1+3)=12, then E_2=3*(1 + E_1)=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39. Wait, but in our earlier approach, Layer2 was 13, which is E_2=39, but Layer2 in the earlier approach was 13, which is before the final multiplication. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the definitions here. Maybe it's better to stick with the earlier approach where each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, leading to a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=29524, and E=3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each layer adds another power of 3. Let me see: Let me consider that each time I add another layer, I'm effectively adding 3^{n} where n increases by 1 each time. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, (1 +3)=4=3^1 +1. Then, the next layer is 1 +3*(4)=1 +12=13=3^2 + 3 +1. Next, 1 +3*13=40=3^3 +3^2 +3 +1. Hmm, so each layer seems to be the sum of a geometric series up to 3^{n}. Indeed, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found earlier. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Then, E=3*a_9=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3, multiplied by 3. Let me try that. Since each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then E=3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2=(3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, E=(3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result as before. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've confirmed it multiple ways now, so I'm confident that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different approaches all lead to the same result.

Wait, but let me check my earlier steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, which also gave me 88572. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to layer 9, which is 29524, multiply by 3 to get 88572. Yep, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this until the ninth layer, which is 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1,093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1,093 = 3,280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3,280 = 9,841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9,841 = 29,524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the digits. Let's write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems high, but let me confirm by another method.

So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the calculations.

But just to be thorough, let me check each multiplication:\n\nLayer 2: 3*4=12, 1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 3*13=39, 1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 3*40=120, 1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 3*121=363, 1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 3*364=1092, 1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 3*1093=3279, 1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280=9840, 1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841=29523, 1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nWait, but wait: The innermost layer is layer 1, so the outermost layer is layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can see that each layer a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and for n=9, it's 29524, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Therefore, I can conclude that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward.

Let's add 29524 +29524: 29524 +29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 +29524. Let's add 59048 +20000=79048, then +9524=79048 +9524=88572. Yes, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or formula, perhaps using geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 +3, L2=1 +3*L1, L3=1 +3*L2, and so on up to L9. Then, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Suppose L_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, L_n = A*3^{n} + (1 + 3B). Comparing this to our assumed form L_n = A*3^{n} + B, we have B = 1 + 3B, which implies that -2B =1, so B = -1/2. Therefore, L_n = A*3^{n} -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L1 =4. L1 = A*3^{1} -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4. So, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2. Therefore, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have Layer9, that would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is 3 times the previous plus 1, it's a geometric series with ratio 3. The formula I used earlier is a standard approach for such linear recursions. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).
