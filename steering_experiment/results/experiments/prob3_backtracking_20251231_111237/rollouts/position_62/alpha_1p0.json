    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me go back through the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me recast each layer step by step again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since each term is built upon the previous one, computing each layer step by step seems straightforward and manageable.

Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems to be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, this seems like each term is following a pattern. Let's see if we can find a general formula for L_n. Let's compute a few more terms to see the pattern: L_1 = 4 = (3^1) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4? Wait, no, 3^1 + 1 = 4, yes. L_2 = 13 = 3^2 + 1 + something? Wait, 3^2 = 9, 9 + 4 = 13. Hmm, maybe. Let's see: L_1 = 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1^1? Not sure. L_2 = 13 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 1? 9 + 3 +1 = 13. Yes, that works. L_3 = 40. Let's see: 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1? 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40. Yes, that's correct. So, it seems that L_n = 3^n + 3^(n-1) + ... + 3^1 + 1. So, L_n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Wait, because 3^0 is 1, 3^1 is 3, up to 3^n. So, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. That's a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from k=0 to k=n. The sum of a geometric series is (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). So, for r=3, sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula holds for the layers I've already computed. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. So, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression. Let me think. The entire expression is 3*(L_9). But L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the geometric series. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that seems off. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000. 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out.

So 88572? Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524\n+29524\n+29524\n---------\nFirst, add 29524 + 29524:\n29524 + 29524:\n4 + 4 = 8\n2 + 2 = 4\n5 + 5 = 10, carry over 1\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, carry over 1\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\nSo, 59048.\n\nNow, add 59048 + 29524:\n59048 + 29524:\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry over 1\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n0 + 5 = 5\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry over 1\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\nSo, 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, but I thought earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, so 3 * 29524 is 88572. But let me check if I computed Layer 9 correctly because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers.\n\nWait, let's go back and check each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but that seems like a very large number. Let me check if I've counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3(...). So the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, which matches my earlier computation. So each layer is correctly computed, so the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication when computing Layer 9. Let me compute 3*9841 again.\n\n3*9841:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n9000 *3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 +3=29523\n\nSo 3*9841=29523, then 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524*3 again using another method.\n\n29524*3:\n\nBreak it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4)*3\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the number seems so large. Let me check if I've counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen, each next layer is 1 +3*(...). So how many times does \"1 +3(\" occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nAfter the first 3, the expression is (1 + 3(...)), so each time there's an opening parenthesis, it's a new layer.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After first 3: (1 + 3(\n2. Then another ( after 3: (1 + 3(\n3. And so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+\" occurs. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer.\n\nIn the original expression, how many \"1+\" are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen, each next layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, each \"1+\" is a new layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of \"1+\" in the entire expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by a \"3(\" except the innermost one. So, let's see:\n\n- The first \"1+\" is inside the first 3(...), then each subsequent \"1+\" is inside another 3(...).

Let me check that: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...), so the first 3 is outside all the layers. So, the way I computed it, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the sequence would be a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. So, the expression is 3*a_9. Now, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Substituting the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Now, let's subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for a_9. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, especially since this could be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 And so on. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers: For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to write this without computing each layer, I could use the formula for L_n and then multiply by 3. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step layer computation and the formula using the recurrence relation lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Let me think. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 =1 +3, a_2=1 +3a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe there's a pattern or a recursive formula here. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. Since each a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's solve for A and B. When n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + B=3A + B. When n=2, a_2=13= A*3^2 + B=9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B =4, 9A + B=13. Subtract the first equation from the second: 6A=9 => A= 9/6= 3/2. Now, plug A= 3/2 into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B=4 => 9/2 + B=4 => B=4 - 9/2= -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, I think I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me double-check because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and I thought there were nine layers, but let me count again. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+\" sections. Each \"1+\" is followed by another layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the inside, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+\" appears. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's one. Then each time it's 1+3(...). Let's see: Each opening parenthesis adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers because each time you go out, you add another layer. Wait, let me count the number of \"1+\" sections. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Therefore, there are 9 layers. So, I computed up to layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Alternatively, maybe I should compute each layer step by step, writing down each computation to ensure accuracy. Let me try that again, more carefully. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check my calculations for each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let's see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I still get the same result. That's reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and saved some time, but computing each layer step by step also works. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. Let me check that calculation again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry 1, write 2. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carry 1, write 5. 9*3=27+1=28, carry 2, write 8. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for L_9, which is the outermost layer, we can compute it as L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allows for a more straightforward solution. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, I found that each layer L_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step layer computation and using the recurrence formula\u2014lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus three times the previous layer.

Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Let's write 29524 as 2 9 5 2 4.

Okay, that matches. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Starting from the innermost layer, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution. This method is more efficient and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the general method in case the problem scales up. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, which took me from layer 1 up to layer 9, each time substituting the previous result into the next layer. 3. After computing layer 9, multiply by 3 to get the final result. 4. As a check, I modeled the problem using a recurrence relation, found a closed-form solution, and confirmed that the result was the same. 5. Cross-verified the multiplication step to ensure that 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, after all these steps, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 is:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me confirm that 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. Yes, because 30000 * 3 = 90000, and 29524 is 30000 - 476, so 90000 - (476*3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That checks out.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840.

Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524, and that's 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. Then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series, but each term is 1 + 3*previous. Wait, actually, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nIf I can find a closed-form formula for L_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and the solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWait, actually, more accurately, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So when n=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can also think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me try that approach. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and so on, it's a geometric series with ratio 3.\n\nBut actually, when I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nIf I expand it, each term would be 3^k for k from 0 to 9, but I need to be careful because the nesting adds a 1 at each level.\n\nWait, perhaps the total expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1)...)).\n\nBut actually, when I expand it, each level adds another 3^something.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to stick with the recurrence relation solution I found earlier.\n\nIn any case, since I already have the answer as 88572, and I verified each step, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So yes, 3^10 is 59049, so L9 is (59049 -1)/2=29524, and 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\) where each layer is defined as:\n\n\\[ L_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_{n-1} \\]\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\cdot L_9 \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, let me verify that. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation of each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, both by computing each layer step by step and by using the recurrence relation formula. So, yeah, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation formula, we find that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check that: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in computation. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me see if this forms a geometric series or something. Let me denote the layers as a sequence. Let me define a recursive sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By breaking down each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we can compute the value step by step. Using a recursive approach and verifying with a general formula for the sequence, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually. Let's denote L(n) as the value of layer n. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous part is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1. Wait, no, actually, the recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: L(1) = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer 9 would be L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is essentially a geometric series. Let me explore that angle. The expression 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be seen as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let's see: Let me denote S as the sum of the series inside the expression. So, S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is similar to S = 1 + 3*S. Wait, that seems recursive. Solving for S: S = 1 + 3*S => S - 3*S = 1 => -2*S =1 => S= -1/2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because all the terms are positive. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't directly applicable because the series is finite, not infinite. That's why the earlier approach of using the recursive formula and solving it step by step or using the closed-form expression was more appropriate. So, in this case, since the expression is finite with nine layers, using the closed-form formula L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2 for n=9 gives us the correct value. Then, multiplying by 3 gives the final result. Another way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, it's a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but each term is being added in a specific way. However, since it's finite, the closed-form approach is the most straightforward. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything. 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. 3. After computing Layer 9, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. 4. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation and apply it to find Layer 9, then multiply by 3. Both methods led me to the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I've covered all the necessary steps and verified my work through multiple methods. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 30000 * 3 = 90000. Then subtract (30000 - 29524) = 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, which is similar to a geometric series or something. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, this looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can express a_n in terms of a_(n-1). So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_(n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can look for a pattern or find a closed-form formula. Let's see if we can find a pattern by computing a few more terms, but we've already computed up to a_9. Alternatively, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_(n-1), with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I even double-checked using a general formula for the recurrence relation, which gave me the same result as computing each layer step by step. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which simplifies the computation. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term.

Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check if I did all the layers correctly because that seems like a big number. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursion. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula here. Let's define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive relation where each layer depends on the previous one. To solve this recursion, we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions and C is a particular solution. Let me find C first. Assume that L_n approaches a constant C as n increases, so C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the particular solution is -1/2. Then, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recursive pattern, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially. But recognizing the pattern and using the formula definitely speeds things up and reduces the chance of error. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, that would be 88572. Let me check that again because when I did the earlier step-by-step, I thought of 29524 as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, but that's not accurate. Let me correct that. Let me compute 29524 * 3 properly: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, so units place is 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, tens place is 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.

Let me verify: 29524 * 3: Let me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. But 29524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 29524 * 3 = 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) terms. From the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time it's 1+3(...). Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, that's 9 layers because each 3(...) is a layer. Wait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I ended up with 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But I'm wondering if I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. Let me write the expression with each layer labeled:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo yes, that's 9 layers inside the 3(...). So, the calculation seems correct. Each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, using the formula, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we can compute each layer without manually calculating each step. That's a huge time-saver. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Alternatively, we can express the entire original expression as 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. That's another way to see it, which confirms our previous result. So, the final answer is 88,572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} to confirm it's 177,147. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Yes, that's correct. So, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Perfect, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me verify if I computed each layer correctly. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I feel like maybe I missed something because the numbers are getting quite large. Let me check each step again to be sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think that's the correct result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me recast the problem: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...). So, it's like a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, we can see that a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the problem reduces to finding a_9 and then multiplying by 3. Now, perhaps there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check by computing a few more layers to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake earlier. Let's compute up to Layer 5 again using the formula: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364. Using the formula: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So, the formula seems solid. Therefore, I can trust that a_9 is indeed 29524, and 3 times that is 88572. So, I think I've solved the problem correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By working from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step. Recognizing the pattern, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the 9th layer efficiently.

So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9.

Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.

By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Alternatively, this resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nCompute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\na_1 = 4 = 1 + 3\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\nWait, that seems like each a_n is 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^{n} ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40\n\nYes, so in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the multiplication step, let me recompute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the standard multiplication method:\n\n    29524\n  x     3\n  --------\n    88572\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nAlright, so after carefully computing each step and verifying my work, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

First, write the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Compute\" and the solution is 88572. So, I think that's the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4 * 3 = 12. So, units place is 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, hold on. Earlier, I wrote 1093, but that's 1,093. So, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093. 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. So, Layer 7 is 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Let's compute 3*3,280. 3,000*3=9,000, 280*3=840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 3*9,841. 9,000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Hmm, but wait, when I computed Layer 7, I wrote 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280, which is correct. Then Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841. Correct. Then Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which would have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The recurrence is: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation because of the constant term 1. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution, L_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution. Let's assume L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence relation: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, substituting n=1 into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. We can factor out 1/2: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2,187; 3^8 = 6,561; 3^9 = 19,683; 3^10 = 59,049. So, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. That confirms the result again. So, using the formula, we can compute it more efficiently without having to compute each layer manually, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable, albeit a bit time-consuming. So, to recap, the process was: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting with Layer 1 and moving up to Layer 9. 3. Verify each computation to ensure accuracy. 4. After computing Layer 9, multiply by 3 to get the final result. 5. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using recurrence relations to compute the result more efficiently. Both methods led to the same final answer: 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value at the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093.

Wait, let me verify that multiplication. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 4*3=12, carry 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carry 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because if any layer is wrong, the final answer will be off. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more quickly, but given that there are only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. But just to explore, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. That's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. The solution is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c = 3, d = 1. So, the general solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, our initial condition is a_1 = 4, not a_0. Let me adjust the indices. Let me define a_0 = 1 (the innermost 1 + 3 would be a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, where a_0 = 1). So, a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches our earlier computation. Then, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_0 = 1. So, using the formula for such a recurrence: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify that. For n=0, a_0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. Correct. For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct, as we had before. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. So, that's a quicker way to compute it. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572. So, I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So yes, that seems accurate. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >=2. So, L_1 = 4, L_2=13, L_3=40, and so on, up to L_9=29524. So, in general, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This kind of recurrence relation can be solved using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find A and B. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and L_1=4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression using the formula. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(L_9), where L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2:177144/2=88572. So that's another way to compute it, using the formula. Either way, I get the same result:88572.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 30000 * 3 is 90000, so 29524 * 3 should be just under 90000, which 88572 is. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, let me check with another method: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back to the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if Layer 9 is wrong, then everything after that is wrong. Let's recompute the layers step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me check: The original expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, does that correspond to n=9? Let me see: If Layer 1 is 1 + 3, then a_1 = 4. Layer 2 is 1 + 3*a_1, so a_2 = 13, and so on up to a_9 = 29524. So, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms the answer is correct. So, I think I've arrived at the correct solution by both iterative computation and by using the recurrence relation formula. It's always good to check using different methods to make sure the answer is consistent. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, but let me verify that with another method to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result would be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't miscalculate any of them. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression using another approach, like recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me see. The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I let a_n be the nth term, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9, which we found to be 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + D => 3C + D = 4. Now, let's find the steady-state solution. If we set a_n = a_{n-1} = D, then D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Hmm, but that seems a bit messy, and perhaps unnecessary for this problem since n is small (n=9). Alternatively, I can compute each term iteratively, which is what I did earlier. So, perhaps the step-by-step approach is the most straightforward here. Alternatively, I can write out the terms more formally. Let me try to express the entire expression step by step, layer by layer, to ensure I haven't missed anything. Let me write each layer again with their computed values:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it as:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, we get 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can verify using another multiplication method, such as splitting the number:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nThen, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the multiplication, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or a formula. The expression is a nested multiplication where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous term. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, the expression can be represented as a geometric series. Let me try to see if that's possible. Let's consider the innermost term first. Starting from the innermost layer: Let me define the expression as follows: Let\u2019s denote E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to E_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9. So, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for E_n. The recurrence relation is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say E_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition E_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: E_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: E_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: E_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so E_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer. So, the problem is solved, and the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation approach, we find that each layer follows a pattern, leading to a closed-form solution. The final result after computing all layers and multiplying by 3 is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSince we have 9 layers, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the general formula approach. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe found the general solution as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTesting for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, for n=9: (3^{10}-1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. So, correct.\n\nThus, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), assuming k \u2260 1. In our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, k = 3, c = 1. The initial term a_1 is 4, as we computed earlier. Wait, but actually, let me see. If we consider the innermost layer as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, etc. So, the general formula would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2, where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, actually, let me derive it properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a geometric progression or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting with 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, etc. Maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me see: If I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Correct. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that it's correct.

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 *3=88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because the number seems so large, and sometimes with these nested expressions, there's a pattern or formula that can simplify the computation without having to calculate each layer manually. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this more efficiently. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1=4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. Plugging in n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B =13. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) =13 -4 =>6A=9 =>A=9/6=3/2=1.5. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B=4 =>9/2 + B=4 =>B=4 -9/2=8/2 -9/2= -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: L_1=(3^{2})/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9=(3^{10})/2 -1/2. Because n=9, so 3^{9+1}=3^{10}. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=59049/2 -1/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9=3*(59048/2)=3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, then the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, I can see that this is a recurrence relation. Let me write it down: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. So, I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the closed-form formula give the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the value of the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
