    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Looking at the structure: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as before. So the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. So, that's consistent.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I've got it. The key was recognizing the pattern and then using the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, which made it much easier than computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. It's also a good idea to verify the result using two different methods to ensure that there are no mistakes. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 8 (from the 2*3+2), 8 (from 9*3+1), 5 (from 5*3), 7 (from 2*3+1), 2 (from 4*3). So the number is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then 3*29524 = 88572 (correct). Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use to compute this without calculating each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers (from Layer 1 to Layer 9), the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding all the layers, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) Let's denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) Let me see if I can express this recursively. Let me define E_n as the expression with n layers. Then, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. Wait, no, actually, in our problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Wait, perhaps E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), with E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, maybe E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, that's similar to what I did before. So, for n layers, E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting with E_1 = 4. So, for n=9, E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8, and so on. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9. Alternatively, using the formula I found earlier, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as before. Then, 3*E_9 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Another way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively adding another power of 3. So, the total expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 Wait, but 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121? Let's check: 1 + 3 = 4; 4 +9=13; 13+27=40; 40+81=121. Yes, correct. So, each layer adds another term which is 3^{k} where k increases by 1 each time. So, Layer n: 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}. Wait, but that's a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to m is (3^{m+1} - 1)/ (3 - 1) ) = (3^{m+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in Layer 1, we have 1 + 3 = 4, which is (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 +27=40, which is (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. So, indeed, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to make sure, let me compute each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3:40 Layer4:121 Layer5:364 Layer6:1093 Layer7:3280 Layer8:9841 Layer9:29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that all checks out. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).

So, writing it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the layers earlier. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first 3, then each (1 + 3(...)). So, after the initial 3, there are 9 more layers? Wait, no, let me count the number of times (1 + 3(...) appears. Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent (1 + 3(...) is another layer. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the first ( is layer 1: (1+3). Then each subsequent ( is another layer. Let's count: 3(1+3(...)) => layer 1: 1+3(...). Then inside that is another (1+3(...)), which is layer 2, and so on until the last one. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of (1+3(...) segments. From the expression, after the initial 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the first (1+3(...) is layer 1, then each subsequent is another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that: (1+3(...))\n3. Inside that: (1+3(...))\n...\nHow many times does (1+3(...) occur? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the initial 3 is followed by 9 opening parentheses? Wait, no, each (1+3(...) is a separate layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3 is followed by another parenthesis. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then inside it, there's a (1+3(...)), which is layer 1. Then inside that, another (1+3(...)), layer 2, and so on until layer 9, which is the innermost (1+3). Wait, no, the innermost is (1+3), without another layer inside. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is (1+3). Then each layer above that adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of (1+3(...) segments, which is 9. Because the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is layer 1, and each layer above adds another 1+3(...). So, layer 1: (1+3) = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me write down each layer with its computation: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Let me just verify one more time by computing each layer again to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct).

Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So, yes, 87572. Hmm, but let me double-check my multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000. Then subtract 476 * 3 because 30000 - 476 = 29524. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that's different from my previous result. So which one is correct? Did I make a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication? Let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 87572. But when I broke it down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. Clearly, I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check the digit-by-digit multiplication again. Wait, perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let's write it out properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x      3\n   ----------\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87572.\n\nBut when I broke it down, I had:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that's 88572, which is different from 87572. There's a mistake here. Let me check the breakdown again. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524. So that's correct. Now, multiplying each by 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them step by step:\n\nStart with 60000 (from 20000*3)\n\nAdd 27000: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\nAdd 1500: 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\nAdd 60: 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\nAdd 12: 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nHmm, so this gives 88572, but the digit-by-digit multiplication gave me 87572. There must be a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check the digit-by-digit multiplication again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out with proper alignment:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x      3\n   ----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Units place is 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 (tens place) * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Tens place is 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 (hundreds place) * 3 = 15. Hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 (thousands place) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place is 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 (ten-thousands place) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands place is 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 8 (ten-thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 87572.\n\nBut when I broke it down, I got 88572. So where is the mistake? Let me add 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 again:\n\n20000*3 = 60,000\n\n9000*3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500*3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n20*3 = 60 \u2192 88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nWait, so this gives 88,572, but the digit-by-digit method gave me 87,572. There's a 1000 difference here. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check the digit-by-digit multiplication again, perhaps I misaligned the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: positions are ten-thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, units.\n\nSo:\n\nDigit 1: 4 (units)\n\nDigit 2: 2 (tens)\n\nDigit 3: 5 (hundreds)\n\nDigit 4: 9 (thousands)\n\nDigit 5: 2 (ten-thousands)\n\nSo when multiplying by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo the result is 8 (ten-thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units), which is 87,572.\n\nBut when I broke it down into parts, I got 88,572. That suggests that I made a mistake in the breakdown method. Wait, perhaps I added incorrectly. Let me check the breakdown again:\n\n20000*3 = 60,000\n\n9000*3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500*3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n20*3 = 60 \u2192 88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, which is correct. So, 20000*3 is 60,000; 9000*3 is 27,000; 500*3 is 1,500; 20*3 is 60; 4*3 is 12. Adding these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, that's correct. Then why does the digit-by-digit method give me 87,572? I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit calculation. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the thousands place. Let me check:\n\nAfter multiplying each digit:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n- Hundreds: 5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n- Thousands: 9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n- Ten-thousands: 2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 8\n\nSo the result is 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units) \u2192 88,572.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So I think I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method earlier by misplacing the thousands digit. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, when I have 9*3=27 +1=28, I write down 8 in the thousands place and carryover 2 to the ten-thousands place.\n\nThen, 2*3=6 +2=8 in the ten-thousands place.\n\nSo the number is 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units) \u2192 88,572.\n\nSo that matches the breakdown method. Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 87,572. So I must have miscounted the digits. Therefore, the correct final result is 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check by another method. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another approach. 29524 is close to 30,000. 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. But 29524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 29524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - (476 * 3). Now, 476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200 + 210 = 1410 + 18 = 1428. Therefore, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that confirms it. So the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the digit-by-digit method gave me 87,572, but that was a mistake. The correct digit-by-digit method gives 88,572, which matches the other methods. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut let me go back to the layers to make sure I computed each layer correctly because if any layer was wrong, the final result would be off.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer was computed correctly, so the final result is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just verify one more time, perhaps by computing from the inside out again.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one until we reach the outermost layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses (Layer 1):**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    - Multiply the result by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 87572. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, so 2 with carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, so 5 with carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 87572. Therefore, the final result is 87572. But wait, let me confirm that each layer was computed correctly because if I made a mistake in one layer, it would propagate through all the subsequent layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As computed earlier, that's 87572. So I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step. The expression resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The closed-form solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_0*r^n)/(1 - r), but wait, actually, the standard solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n-1}*a_1 + c*(r^{n-1} - 1)/(r - 1). Let me check that formula. Yes, for a recurrence a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the closed-form is a_n = a_1*r^{n-1} + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - r))*(r)^{n} + c/(1 - r). Let me verify that. Let's take n=1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Using the formula: a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n} + c/(1 - r). Plugging in n=1: a_1 = (4 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{1} + 1/(1 - 3). Compute 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, a_1 = (4 - (-1/2)) * 3 + (-1/2) = (4 + 1/2)*3 - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Wait, but a_1 is 4, not 13. Hmm, maybe I have the formula wrong. Let me try deriving it properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we saw earlier, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous. To find a closed-form, we can write the general solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. The outermost layer is a_9, since there are nine layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, using the closed-form formula also leads us to the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 87572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 87572\\)\n\n\\boxed{87572}"

Let me verify this multiplication using another method to be sure. 29524 \u00d7 3: Let's break it down as 29524 \u00d7 (3) = (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 30000\u00d73 - 476\u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So the final result is 88572. But wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier layers, let me go back and check each computation step by step. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. But when I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, when I computed Layer 9, that's the innermost part, right? Wait, no, actually, in the original expression, the innermost is the first 1+3, which is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, when I computed Layer 9, that's the outermost expression before multiplying by the initial 3. So, yes, then the total expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me think about it. The general form is: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1 to 9, a_9 would be the value we computed as 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f. Yep, the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f. So that's consistent with what I computed earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) =88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire original expression in terms of the formula, it would be 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572 \u2714\ufe0f. So that's another way to see it. But since the problem asks to compute the expression, and we've arrived at 88572 through multiple methods, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. This looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n =3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, and both give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to double-check.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a formula for L_n. The general solution for L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4 is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1 each time. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Wait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but given the structure, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward. Another way to see it is that each time you're adding 1 and then scaling by 3, which is exactly what the recurrence does. So, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we can directly compute a_9 without having to compute each layer manually, which would be especially useful if n were larger. But since n is 9 here, computing each layer step by step isn't too bad, but it's good to know the general formula for future reference. So, in summary, the problem required computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, I was able to find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that, ultimately leading to the final result of 88572 after multiplying the outermost layer by 3. It was a bit tedious to compute each layer manually, but using the formula derived from the recurrence relation made it much more efficient. I feel confident now that the answer is correct because both methods yielded the same result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5 *3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9 *3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2 *3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. That confirms it. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have miscalculated one of them. Let me go through each layer again to ensure there are no errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, the calculations seem correct. Alternatively, I could notice a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. Then, L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, L4 = 121, L5 = 364, L6 = 1093, L7 = 3280, L8 = 9841, L9 = 29524. Each term can be represented as Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, where n starts from 1, and L1 = 4. Alternatively, this can be seen as a geometric series. Let me think about that. The recursion is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the formula for Layer n, which is (3^(n+1)-1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*(3^(10)-1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same final answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is correct. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern allowed me to find a formula, which makes the computation much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, even though there are nine layers, computing each step by step isn't too bad, especially since each step is straightforward multiplication and addition. I think I might have made a mistake if I tried to compute multiple layers at once without writing them down, but by taking it one step at a time, I avoided errors. So, in summary, by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outward, computing each layer step by step, and then multiplying the final layer by 3, I arrived at the solution of 88572. Additionally, verifying the result using the formula derived from the recurrence relation confirmed that the answer is correct. It's a good exercise in recognizing patterns and applying recursive thinking to solve nested expressions.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check again. Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds:5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten thousands:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.

Yes, because 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is building up a number in base 3. Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating it. Let me check: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) is similar to expanding digits in base 3. But perhaps that's not necessary here since I've already solved it using two methods: step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation. Both led me to the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Let me see if I can model it as such. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me write down the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Which matches what I computed earlier. Now, to find a closed-form expression for a_n, I can solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with a_1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have a_9, since we have nine layers.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, so the total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nEither way, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by computing each layer step by step and by finding a closed-form solution using the recurrence relation. Both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

Correct.\n\nSo, yes, Layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check the multiplication again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake there. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15.

Alternatively, I can break down 29524 as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me confirm that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recursive relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. We have L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Assuming L_n = A*3^n + B, substitute into the equation: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) = A*3^n, and 3*B + 1. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is tripling and adding one, leading to a geometric progression. But I think the step-by-step approach was thorough and the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, the result is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm using another method. 29524 * 3: 30000 * 3 = 90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476, so 90000 - (476 * 3). 476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18, so 1200+210=1410 +18=1428. So 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to model this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1=4\na_2=1 + 3*4=13\na_3=1 + 3*13=40\na_4=1 + 3*40=121\na_5=1 + 3*121=364\na_6=1 + 3*364=1093\na_7=1 + 3*1093=3280\na_8=1 + 3*3280=9841\na_9=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nSo, each term is indeed following the pattern. Now, to find a formula for a_n, I can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K =1 +3K => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations because I double-checked each layer and also derived a formula to confirm the result. It's always good to verify using a different method to ensure accuracy, especially with such a nested and repetitive structure.

Let me check that: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through the layers again to verify each step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the problem is only nine layers deep, it's manageable to compute each one. I wonder if this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time you add 1 and then three times the previous result. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote the layers as a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the problem reduces to finding a_9 and then multiplying by 3. Now, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me write out the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as before, a_9 is 29524, and then the total is 3*a_9 = 88572. Now, to see if there's a pattern or formula for a_n, let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we need a_9, let's compute that: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation. That might have saved some time instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, both methods work. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, each layer's value is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.

So yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the recurrence approach, let me check with n=4: a_4 should be 121. Using the formula: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct).

Alternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct result. Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if that's applicable here. Since each term is multiplied by 3, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a sum of a geometric progression. Let me try expanding the expression step by step to see if that's possible. Starting from the innermost: Let\u2019s denote E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try expanding E step by step, but this might get too messy. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have 9 layers, maybe the entire expression can be represented as 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). Wait, let me think. Each layer adds another 3^k term. Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly, because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me try to express E in terms of a geometric series. Let\u2019s denote E as 3*(L_9), where L_9 is the 9th layer. As we found earlier, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. So, E = 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, E = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result as before. So, using the geometric series approach, I also get 88572. Therefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series\u2014I consistently arrive at the same answer of 88572. I think that solidifies the conclusion that the computed value is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by a geometric series. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine the value of the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a linear recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let L_n be the value of the nth layer. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4.\n\n3. **General Solution**: Solving the recurrence, we find L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute Layer 9**: For n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, yes, it's 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers, let me go through the layers again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write it down: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 =13 a3=1 +3*a2=1+39=40 a4=1+3*a3=1+120=121 a5=1+3*a4=1+363=364 a6=1+3*a5=1+1092=1093 a7=1+3*a6=1+3279=3280 a8=1+3*a7=1+9840=9841 a9=1+3*a8=1+29523=29524 So, indeed, each term is defined by the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps it can be solved in a closed-form. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula. In this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 =4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check if I applied the formula correctly. Since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each term is 3 times the previous plus 1, so the entire expression is a sum of a geometric series multiplied by some factor. But in this case, since we've already found a closed-form solution, I think that's sufficient.\n\nSo, to recap: I broke down the problem into layers, computed each layer step by step, verified each step, then used the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, which gave me the same result. Then, multiplied by 3 to get the final answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression.

Wait, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 + 120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524=88572. All steps check out. So, I think I did this correctly. It was a bit tedious, but by breaking it down layer by layer, I could manage the computation without getting lost. I was worried I might make an arithmetic mistake, especially with such large numbers, but by carefully computing each step and verifying as I went, I feel confident in my answer. I remember that sometimes when expressions are nested like this, there's a formula or a pattern that can simplify the computation, especially if it's a geometric series or something similar. But in this case, since each layer is 1 plus three times the previous layer, it's a linear recurrence, and computing each term step by step is manageable. I wonder if there's a general formula for such expressions. Let me think. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I computed. This is a linear recurrence relation, and such relations can often be solved using methods from discrete mathematics. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let me recall the formula. For a recurrence relation a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k - 1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k - 1). Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*k^n, and the particular solution is a constant if c is a constant. So, let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Wait, actually, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n^{(h)} - 3*a_{n-1}^{(h)} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, our first term is a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer increases n by 1. Since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrived at the same result without computing each layer step by step. That was a good exercise in recurrence relations. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern can lead to a more efficient solution. I think I'll stick with the step-by-step computation for now since it's straightforward, but knowing the formula could save time in the future, especially with more layers. So, in conclusion, after carefully computing each nested layer and verifying with a general formula for such recurrence relations, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive relation, right? So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each a_n is defined in terms of a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, if I didn't realize the recurrence relation, computing each layer step by step would have worked, but it's more time-consuming. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula and see if they match. For example, Layer 4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches. Layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, I can be sure that my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Wait, but let me double-check all my steps because that's a lot of layers, and I don't want to make a mistake. Let me recount the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. The general formula for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4 (since a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4), we can find C: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the first few layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let's see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). If I expand the entire expression, it might resemble a geometric series. Let me try expanding it step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, with n=9, gives a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, so 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This recurrence can be expanded as a geometric series:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))).\n\nExpanding this, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} + 3^{n}*a_1.\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not quite accurate. Let me try expanding it properly.\n\nLet me write a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*a_{n-2}\n\nSo, substituting back, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this way, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1}*a_1\n\nBut since a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3, so a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit messy. Maybe using the formula I found earlier is better.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the entire expression as S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Let me denote S as the entire expression, so S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 8 layers inside.\n\nWait, but that might not help because the layers are finite. So, maybe it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation or the formula.\n\nIn any case, both methods have led me to the same result: 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident enough that this is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I think I'm done.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using the formula for such a recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Each step seems correct. Let me check one of the layers again to be sure. Let's say Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer4. Layer4 is 121, so 3*121=363, then 1+363=364. Correct. Layer6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364=1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093=3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think I did each step correctly. I don't see any errors in my calculations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute. Let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous computations. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then 3*29524: Let's compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3. Break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable. If it were more layers, I might look for a pattern or formula, but here, step-by-step computation works fine. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, putting it all together: 8,8,7,5,2. So, 88752. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing from top to bottom: 8,8,7,5,2. So the result is 88,752. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nAdding units: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nTens: 2 + 2 = 4\n\nHundreds: 5 + 5 = 10, carry over 1\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, carry over 1\n\nTen-thousands: 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88,572? Wait, that doesn't match my previous result. Wait, did I make a mistake? Wait, 29524 + 29524 is 59048.

But earlier, I thought it was 88,752. That's conflicting. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another approach. Let's break down 29524:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 3 * 20000 = 60,000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27,000\n\n3 * 500 = 1,500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nOkay, so that confirms it. The correct result is 88,572, not 88,752 as I initially thought when I multiplied digit by digit. So, I must have made a mistake in my digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Let me see where I went wrong. When I did the digit-by-digit:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it as 88,752. Wait, but the correct answer is 88,572. So, I think I messed up the digit positions when writing down the result. Let me write it again properly, keeping track of each digit's place.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from top to bottom: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,752. But that contradicts the other method which gave me 88,572. There must be a mistake in my digit alignment.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write down the number 29524 properly with commas for clarity: 29,524. So, the digits are:\n\n- 2 (ten-thousands place)\n- 9 (thousands place)\n- 5 (hundreds place)\n- 2 (tens place)\n- 4 (units place)\n\nSo, when multiplying each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 (units) * 3 = 12 \u2192 units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 (tens) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens digit is 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 (hundreds) * 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 (thousands) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands digit is 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 (ten-thousands) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten-thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from left to right: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 88,752. But when I added 29,524 three times, I got 88,572. So, where is the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition earlier. Let me re-add 29,524 three times.\n\nFirst, 29,524 + 29,524:\n\nAdding the units: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nTens: 2 + 2 = 4\n\nHundreds: 5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 write down 0, carryover 1\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 write down 9, carryover 1\n\nTen-thousands: 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048.\n\nNow, adding another 29,524 to 59,048:\n\n59,048 + 29,524:\n\nUnits: 8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\nTens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nHundreds: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 1\n\nTen-thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that's different from the digit-by-digit multiplication which gave me 88,752. So, I must have messed up the digit positions when writing the multiplication result. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought the digits were:\n\n- 2 (units)\n- 7 (tens)\n- 5 (hundreds)\n- 8 (thousands)\n- 8 (ten-thousands)\n\nBut that would be 88,752. However, the correct sum is 88,572. So, I must have miscounted the digits. Let me write the multiplication step by step, ensuring that each digit is in the correct place.\n\nMultiplying 29,524 by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- 4 (units) * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 (tens) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0.\n- 5 (hundreds) * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 (thousands) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 (ten-thousands) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the digits are:\n\n- Units: 2\n- Tens: 7\n- Hundreds: 5\n- Thousands: 8\n- Ten-thousands: 8\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 88,752. But the addition gave me 88,572. I'm confused now.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the addition. Let me try adding 29,524 three times again.\n\nFirst, 29,524 + 29,524:\n\n- 29,524 + 29,524:\n\nUnits: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nTens: 2 + 2 = 4\n\nHundreds: 5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 0, carryover 1\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 9, carryover 1\n\nTen-thousands: 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, sum is 59,048.\n\nNow, 59,048 + 29,524:\n\n- Units: 8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n- Tens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- Hundreds: 0 + 5 = 5\n\n- Thousands: 9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1\n\n- Ten-thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, total is 88,572.\n\nBut according to the digit-by-digit multiplication, it's 88,752. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in either the multiplication or the addition. Let me check the digit-by-digit multiplication again, carefully.\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the digits are:\n\nFrom right to left: 2 (units), 7 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 8 (thousands), 8 (ten-thousands).\n\nWait, that's correct, right? So, the number would be 88,752. But when I added 29,524 three times, I got 88,572. That suggests that one of the methods is wrong. Let me check the addition again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when adding. Let me write it down vertically:\n\n  29,524\n\n+ 29,524\n\n+ 29,524\n\n------------\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\nFirst, add the first two numbers:\n\n  29,524\n\n+ 29,524\n\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 write 0, carryover 1\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 write 9, carryover 1\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, the sum is 59,048.\n\nNow, add 59,048 + 29,524:\n\n  59,048\n\n+ 29,524\n\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n0 + 5 = 5\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 write 8, carryover 1\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, the sum is 88,572.\n\nBut according to the digit-by-digit multiplication, it's 88,752. There's a conflict here. I must have made a mistake in either the multiplication or the addition. Let me check the multiplication once more.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write 29,524 as:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nMultiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n- Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n- Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n- Thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n- Ten-thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from left to right: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 88,752. But the addition gave me 88,572. I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write the multiplication result properly:\n\nWhen multiplying, each digit's result is written in its place, so:\n\n- Units place: 2\n\n- Tens place: 7\n\n- Hundreds place: 5\n\n- Thousands place: 8\n\n- Ten-thousands place: 8\n\nSo, the number is 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units), which is 88,752.\n\nBut when I added 29,524 three times, I got 88,572. So, there must be a mistake in the addition. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I added 59,048 + 29,524 incorrectly. Let me add them digit by digit:\n\n59,048\n\n+29,524\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n0 + 5 = 5\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, the sum is 88,572.\n\nBut according to the multiplication, it's 88,752. I'm getting two different results, which suggests that I made a mistake somewhere. Let me try another approach: compute 29,524 * 3 using expanded form.\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 3 * 20,000 = 60,000\n\n3 * 9,000 = 27,000\n\n3 * 500 = 1,500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, that confirms the addition result. Therefore, the correct answer should be 88,572, not 88,752. So, where did I go wrong in the digit-by-digit multiplication?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits when writing the result. Let me write it again carefully:\n\nMultiplying 29,524 by 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the digits are:\n\nFrom right to left: 2 (units), 7 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 8 (thousands), 8 (ten-thousands).\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units) \u2192 88,752.\n\nBut according to the expanded form, it's 88,572. There's a contradiction here. I must have made a mistake in the digit placement. Wait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing them down. Let me think: when you multiply, each digit's result is placed in its respective place. So, starting from the right:\n\n- The first digit (units) is 2.\n\n- The second digit (tens) is 7.\n\n- The third digit (hundreds) is 5.\n\n- The fourth digit (thousands) is 8.\n\n- The fifth digit (ten-thousands) is 8.\n\nSo, writing it as 88,752. But according to the expanded multiplication, it's 88,572. I'm getting confused because two methods are giving me different results. Let me check with a calculator to resolve this.\n\nWait, I don't have a calculator, but perhaps I can compute it another way. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 by breaking it down differently. 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Ah, that matches the addition and expanded multiplication results. So, the correct answer is 88,572, and I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication by misplacing the digits. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 88,752. So, why is there a discrepancy? Let me check that again. Maybe I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out step by step:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n------------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n1. Units place: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2. Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n3. Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n4. Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n5. Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from left to right (ten-thousands to units):\n\n8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 88,752. But according to the other methods, it's 88,572. I must have made a mistake in the digit positions. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the places. Let me write the number with placeholders:\n\n   _ _ _ _ _\n\n*        3\n\n------------\n\nDigits:\n\n- Ten-thousands: 2\n\n- Thousands: 9\n\n- Hundreds: 5\n\n- Tens: 2\n\n- Units: 4\n\nSo, when multiplying, each digit's result is placed in its respective column:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n- Hundreds: 5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n- Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n- Ten-thousands:2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n- Ten-thousands:8\n\n- Thousands:8\n\n- Hundreds:7\n\n- Tens:5\n\n- Units:2\n\nWait, that's 88,752. But according to the other method, it's 88,572. I'm really confused now. There must be a mistake in my digit placement. Wait, perhaps I mixed up the hundreds and thousands places. Let me think: when writing the result, the digits should be in the correct place values. So, after multiplying:\n\n- Units:2\n\n- Tens:7\n\n- Hundreds:5\n\n- Thousands:8\n\n- Ten-thousands:8\n\nSo, the number is 88,752. But when I broke it down as (30,000 - 476) *3, I got 88,572. Let me check that again: 30,000 *3=90,000. 476*3=1,428. So, 90,000 -1,428=88,572. That seems correct. So, where is the mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication? I must have miscounted the places. Let me write the multiplication again, carefully:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1. 4 (units) *3=12 \u2192 units digit:2, carryover1.\n\n2. 2 (tens) *3=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens digit:7, carryover0.\n\n3. 5 (hundreds) *3=15 \u2192 hundreds digit:5, carryover1.\n\n4. 9 (thousands) *3=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands digit:8, carryover2.\n\n5. 2 (ten-thousands) *3=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten-thousands digit:8.\n\nSo, the digits are:\n\n- Units:2\n\n- Tens:7\n\n- Hundreds:5\n\n- Thousands:8\n\n- Ten-thousands:8\n\nSo, the number is 88,752.\n\nBut according to the expanded form, it's 88,572. I'm stuck. Both methods can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expanded form. Let me check:\n\n29,524 *3= (20,000 +9,000 +500 +20 +4)*3=60,000 +27,000 +1,500 +60 +12=60,000+27,000=87,000+1,500=88,500+60=88,560+12=88,572.\n\nThat's correct. So, the digit-by-digit multiplication must have an error. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of digits. Let me count the digits in 29,524: it's a 5-digit number. So, when I multiply, I should have 5 digits in the result, but 88,752 is a 5-digit number, as is 88,572. But they are different numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the thousands place. Let me check the thousands place again:\n\nIn 29,524, the thousands digit is 9. 9*3=27 +1 (carryover from hundreds place)=28. So, thousands digit is 8, carryover 2 to the ten-thousands place.\n\nThen, ten-thousands digit:2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the digits are:\n\n- Ten-thousands:8\n\n- Thousands:8\n\n- Hundreds:7\n\n- Tens:5\n\n- Units:2\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The hundreds digit comes from 5*3=15, which is 5 in the hundreds place, carryover1.\n\nWait, no, 5*3=15, so hundreds digit is 5, carryover1.\n\nThen, thousands digit:9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands digit is8, carryover2.\n\nThen, ten-thousands digit:2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the digits are:\n\n- Units:2\n\n- Tens:7\n\n- Hundreds:5\n\n- Thousands:8\n\n- Ten-thousands:8\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units) \u2192 88,752.\n\nBut according to the expanded form, it's 88,572. I'm really stuck here. Let me try to compute 29,524 *3 using another method: doubling.\n\n29,524 *3 = 29,524 * (2 +1) = 29,524*2 +29,524.\n\n29,524*2=59,048.\n\n59,048 +29,524=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the correct answer is 88,572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication by misplacing the digits. Probably, I wrote down the hundreds digit as 7 instead of 5. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, in the digit-by-digit multiplication:\n\nAfter units:2\n\nTens:7\n\nHundreds:5\n\nThousands:8\n\nTen-thousands:8\n\nSo, the number is 88,752. But according to the other methods, it's 88,572. I must have mixed up the hundreds and thousands digits. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 5, thousands digit is8. So, the number should be 88,752. But the other methods say 88,572. I'm really confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial layers. Let me go back to the beginning. Maybe I computed one of the layers incorrectly, leading to an incorrect final result. Let me recompute the layers step by step to see if I made a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting over:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*(Layer1)=1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(Layer2)=1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*(Layer3)=1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*(Layer4)=1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*(Layer5)=1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*(Layer6)=1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*(Layer7)=1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*(Layer8)=1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, so according to this, Layer9 is 29,524, and 3*29,524=88,572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the earlier digit-by-digit multiplication must have been wrong because I miscounted the digits or made a placement error. So, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the digits when writing down the multiplication result. It's easy to make a mistake with so many digits. So, to avoid confusion, it's better to compute the layers step by step and then multiply the final layer by 3, as I did here. This way, I get the correct result without getting tangled in digit placement errors.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.\n\n2. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n3. Compute each layer step by step:\n\n   - Layer1:4\n\n   - Layer2:13\n\n   - Layer3:40\n\n   - Layer4:121\n\n   - Layer5:364\n\n   - Layer6:1093\n\n   - Layer7:3280\n\n   - Layer8:9841\n\n   - Layer9:29524\n\n4. Multiply Layer9 by 3:3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step: Multiply Layer 9 by 3:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, putting it all together, starting from the right: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, but let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me write down the terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, it's clear that each term is generated by multiplying the previous term by 3 and adding 1. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its general solution can be found. The homogeneous solution is when the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. I think this confirms that the step-by-step computation is correct, and the formula approach also leads to the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus three times the previous layer. This pattern continues until the outermost layer is reached. Using a recurrence relation, the solution can be found efficiently, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, so the final answer would be 88572. Let me verify that my step-by-step computation of each layer was correct, because if I made a mistake in one of those layers, the final answer will be off.

Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. First, write the homogeneous solution and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution L_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L(1) = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since I only had nine layers, both methods worked fine. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident about this answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, recognizing a recursive pattern. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using the recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula to compute the value efficiently.

Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, but let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, yes, each layer is computed correctly. Then, multiplying the outermost 3 by 29524 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's more of a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value at each layer, starting from n=1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can compute each a_n up to a_9, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Let me compute these terms again to verify:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this as a sum of a geometric series, but I'm not sure if that applies directly here because each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term, which doesn't immediately look like a geometric progression. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form expression, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked each step, verified the computations, and even derived a general formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the value at each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value at the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but that seems too high because when I did the earlier layers, the numbers were increasing, but let me confirm each step because maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40.

Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. So, 29524 is correct for Layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. a_2 =1 +3*a1=1 +12=13. a3=1+3*a2=1+39=40. a4=1+3*a3=1+120=121. a5=1+3*a4=1+363=364. a6=1+3*a5=1+1092=1093. a7=1+3*a6=1+3279=3280. a8=1+3*a7=1+9840=9841. a9=1+3*a8=1+29523=29524. So, a9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let me find B. Setting a_n = B, then B = 1 + 3B => B -3B=1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1=4. When n=1, a1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the values we computed. For n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outer expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a9=29524, then 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let me see: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Let me just confirm all steps once more to ensure I didn't make a mistake. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1+3(...). Each layer was computed step by step, starting from the innermost, giving a9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. The formula approach also confirmed this. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, and I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, it's manageable to compute each step. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern in the layers. Let me list the layers and their values: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Looking at these numbers, is there a pattern or a recurrence relation? Each layer n is 1 + 3*(layer n-1). So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for layer n. The recurrence is: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L(4)=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524=88572. So, both by computing each layer step by step and by finding a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nested expression. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nI know that for such a recurrence, the solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrived at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the expression as repeatedly applying the operation 1 + 3*(previous result), which is exactly what I did step by step.\n\nAnother way to see it is that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, so each time, the value is increasing exponentially because of the multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, yeah, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with the recurrence relation, I'm pretty confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, leading to the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Let me check that again. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write it down step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, it's 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88,572. Hmm, but let me verify that with another method. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then subtract 476 * 3 because 30,000 - 476 = 29,524. Wait, 30,000 - 476 is 29,524. So, 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88,572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093.\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280.\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841.\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524.\n10. Multiply by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I thought Layer 6 was 1,093, but when I got to Layer 9, I had 29,524. Let me double-check each layer to ensure there were no arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the steps check out. So, I think I've computed it correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.
