When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works.

Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, let me check: The original expression is 3*(...), and inside, the innermost is 1+3, which is a_1. Then each layer adds another, so the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as starting with 3*(a_9), and since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.

Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form expression, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divide by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the previous layer's result. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a pattern, leading to a closed-form solution. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is layer 9, which would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Alternatively, if I had more layers, this formula would be super helpful, but for 9 layers, either method works. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(previous result), and so on, up to 9 layers. 3. After computing the 9th layer, multiply by 3 to get the final result. 4. Alternatively, model the problem using a recurrence relation, find a closed-form solution, and compute the 9th term, then multiply by 3. 5. Both methods led to the same result, so I'm confident in the answer. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to double-check, let me verify the multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, writing from top to bottom: 88572. Yep, that's correct.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the outermost layer by 3. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the outermost layer is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
