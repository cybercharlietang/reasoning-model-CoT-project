Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so 3^{9+1}=3^10. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 to a_9, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.

So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3A => A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, as we computed. Then layer 2 is a_2, and so on, up to layer 9, which would be a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of each layer as tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each time it's 3*previous + 1. But in this case, since we have a closed-form, it's easier to compute directly. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I might have just computed each layer step by step, which I did earlier, and arrived at the same answer. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, and then multiplying the outermost layer by 3, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.
