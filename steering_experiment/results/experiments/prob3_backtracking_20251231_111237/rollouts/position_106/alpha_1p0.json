So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 Yes, that's correct. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

    "text": ". So, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, but our initial terms are integers, so maybe this approach isn't directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is better. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me rearrange it: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the RHS is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it gives the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked both by computing each layer and by solving the recurrence relation, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. Then each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the closed-form formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just check if I applied the closed-form correctly. Since a_n is defined as starting from n=1, and we have 9 layers, so a_9 would be the 9th term, which is correct. So, 3*a_9 is indeed 3*(29524) = 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each time you have 1 + 3*(...), it's similar to building a base-3 number or something, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.

Hmm, but that seems fractional, and our initial terms are integers. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is correct, but let's try to find the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Then, plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.

    "text": " Let's equate coefficients: For 3^n: A = 3A => A - 3A = 0 => -2A = 0 => A = 0. Wait, that can't be right because our initial terms are growing. Maybe the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me try that again. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 1, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.

Let me compute this multiplication again to be thorough. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down7. 5*3=15, write down5, carryover1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down8, carryover2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down8. So, 88572. Correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Therefore, the constants must satisfy B = 1 + 2B, which implies -B = 1, so B = -1. Thus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1 = 3A - 1 = 4. So, 3A = 5, A = 5/3. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (5/3)*3^n - 1 = 5*3^{n-1} - 1. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = 5*3^{0} -1 = 5*1 -1 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = 5*3^{1} -1 = 15 -1=14. Wait, but earlier I computed a_2 as 13. Hmm, discrepancy here. That means my assumption is wrong somewhere. Wait, let me check. The initial condition: I used a_1 = 4, but in the recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 is indeed 4, a_2 is 1 + 3*4=13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc. But according to the closed-form formula, a_2 should be 5*3^{1} -1=15-1=14, which is not matching. So, my approach must be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the recurrence starts at a different index. Let me think again. The first term is a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. So, let's try to model the recurrence correctly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's compute a few terms: a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524, as before. Now, the homogeneous solution for the recurrence a_n -3a_{n-1} =1 is different. The homogeneous part is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, characteristic equation r=3, so homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K =1 +3*K => K=1 +3K => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2. Let's test this: For n=1: (3^{2}/2) -1/2= (9/2)-1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3/2)-1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4/2)-1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the general solution is a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods lead to the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

But in our case, all a_n are integers, so maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I need to adjust. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. So homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant, say K. Plug into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

So in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1 =4, then layer 2 is a_2=13, and so on up to layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute a_9: 3^10 is 59049.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, but our initial terms are integers, so maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, maybe I should use the homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the RHS is constant, let's try a constant solution a_n = K. Plug into the equation: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.

I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Innermost layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me write both sides: LHS: A*3^n + B RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B So, equate LHS and RHS: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, as a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as a_2=13. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to see this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3 and adds 1. So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then adds 1. But since we're dealing with a finite number of layers (9 layers), it's easier to compute each step or use the closed-form formula I derived. Either way, the result is 88572. So, I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. Starting from the inside: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). I computed each layer up to the 9th, which gave me 29524. Then I multiplied that by 3 to get the final answer, 88572. Yes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.
