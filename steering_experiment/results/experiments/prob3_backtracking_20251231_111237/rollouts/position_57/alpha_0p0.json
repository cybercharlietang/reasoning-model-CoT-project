Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 *3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a geometric progression. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. Wait, but actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let me solve it: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, matches Layer 2. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, matches Layer 3. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, if I consider that the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer. The innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the value of the ninth layer. Using the recurrence relation formula, we determine that the ninth layer is (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a formula, perhaps related to geometric series or recursion.\n\nLet me think: Let\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nIn general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recursive relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + something, but I might be misremembering. Alternatively, since each term is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let's test this formula with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * L_9, which is 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that matches.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which gives the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I went through each layer step by step, double-checked with a formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Okay, so that's consistent. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Did I compute Layer 9 correctly? Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and after 9 layers, we multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, it was 29524, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is correct. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: Starting from the first 3, we have:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, so starting from the first 3, each (1 + 3(...) is a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n10. 3(...)\n\nWait, actually, the first 3 is outside the first layer, which is 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1), and so on, up to Layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after verifying through both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula or pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, but let's check: when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nNow, the expression has 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, so the total expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me see: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation.\n\nBut whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. Each step checks out, both by direct computation and by using the recurrence formula. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find each layer's value. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which confirms our step-by-step computation. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back and check each step again, because sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an error in one step that propagates outward. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572 (correct). So, each layer seems to be correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone than trying to find a general formula. Another way to approach this might be to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous term. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has nine terms, it's probably faster to compute each step as I did before. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to compute a_n without calculating each step. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence relation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which also matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the result I got earlier when computing each layer manually. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, as before. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Yes, that checks out.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier when computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute the entire expression using a different approach, maybe recognizing a pattern or formula. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple linear recurrence, perhaps I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me write out the terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. So, the value of a_9 is indeed 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach a_n can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier terms.\n\nFor n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn = 5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn = 6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn = 7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn = 8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn = 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2:\n\nFirst, compute 3^{10} = 59049.\n\nSo, 3^{10} - 1 = 59049 - 1 = 59048.\n\nThen, 59048 / 2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it sufficiently through both iterative computation and using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number, starting from the innermost layer.\n\n1.

But let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = 243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the formula for the general solution of such a recurrence, we find \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the outermost layer \\( n = 9 \\), we compute \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each \"1 + 3(...)\" adds a layer. Let's count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time we have \"1 + 3(\", so each \"(\" after \"1 + 3\" starts a new layer. Let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) (Layer 3)\n...\nContinuing until we reach the outermost layer, which is Layer 9.\n\nSo, there are 9 layers in total. I think I accounted for all 9 layers when I computed up to Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another \"1 + 3(...)\". Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers, so yes, Layer 9 is the outermost one, which I multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing one or two layers again to see if I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\n3*29524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and they all seem accurate. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this problem as a geometric series or a recursive sequence, but given that it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually is feasible. If it were more layers, perhaps a formula would be better, but for 9 layers, step-by-step is manageable.\n\nAnother way to approach it might be to recognize that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can compute a_1 through a_9 and then multiply a_9 by 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method also leads to the same result, confirming that the answer is correct.\n\nI could also explore whether there's a closed-form formula for a_n in this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1\n\n-2*a_p = 1\n\na_p = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method using the closed-form formula also confirms that the answer is 88572. It's reassuring to see that both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the entire expression as a geometric series, but given the structure, the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer step by step, verifying each multiplication, and even deriving a closed-form formula, I've arrived at the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88572. I feel confident that this is the correct answer after multiple methods of verification.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the outermost result by 3. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I see that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for Ln. Let me try to find a pattern or a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Let's see if this is a geometric series or something else. Let's compute a few terms: L1 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous part is solving Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has a solution of the form A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say Ln = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So when n=1, L1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's a more efficient way to compute it without having to go through each layer manually. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, so a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = A*r^{n} + (c/(1 - r)), where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. So, the solution would be a_n = A*3^{n} + (1/(1 - 3)) = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a way to express the entire expression in terms of 3^k. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've found that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(...), and inside, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, when I computed up to a_9, that's correct because each 1+3(...) is a layer, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_9 is the value of the innermost 9 layers, and then multiplied by 3. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, then the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as computed. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a formula. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we compute the innermost layer and work our way outward, ultimately multiplying the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Recognizing the pattern, the nth layer can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Compute the Final Result**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go back through the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute, I'm a bit confused because when I look at the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing a few layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLet's go through Layers 1 to 3 again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWait, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093:\n\n1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280:\n\n3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841:\n\nLet me break this down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.\n\nSo, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again. Maybe I should compute it more carefully.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3 as:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression using another approach. Since each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L1. So:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n...\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nSo, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution can be found using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - b*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - b = 0, so r = b. So, the homogeneous solution is C*b^n.\n\nThen, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say P.\n\nSo, substituting into the recurrence: P = a + b*P\nSolving for P: P - b*P = a => P*(1 - b) = a => P = a / (1 - b)\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = 3.\n\nSo, the particular solution is P = 1 / (1 - 3) = 1 / (-2) = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost expression is 3*L9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, this method also gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think I've double-checked it enough times, both by computing each layer step by step and by finding a general formula for the layers and applying it. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm pretty sure that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost. Each layer is computed as:\n\\[ L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\]\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n- Layer 1: \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe final step is to multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Therefore, I think 88572 is the right answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a geometric sequence, but each term is multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1\n\n-2*a_p = 1\n\na_p = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for all layers. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me verify the multiplication 29524 * 3 once again:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by breaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYep, same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the problem into layers, computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation formula, and double-checking the multiplication, I've arrived at the solution. It's a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. I think I understand this problem better now!\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

That's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.

Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is built upon the previous one. This is a recursive sequence.\n\nIn general, for such a linear recurrence relation, we can solve it using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost layer was Layer 1, which is a_1=4, then Layer 2 is a_2=13, up to Layer 9, which would be a_9.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent. 3^10 is indeed 59049, because 3^5 is 243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the approach was to recognize the nested pattern, compute each layer step by step, and then use a formula derived from the recurrence relation to confirm the result. Both methods led to the same answer, so I'm confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find the value of the ninth layer and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(next term). Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer depends on the previous one.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Recurrence Formula**: Recognize that each layer follows a recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Solving this, we find a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For Layer 9 (n=9), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Final Multiplication**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, it's manageable to compute each step manually. I don't recall a specific formula for such expressions, but perhaps recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar could help. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. It's a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + (b/(1 - a)), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Let's check that. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p =1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3 =4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: L_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the recurrence relation and formula. That might have been faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, either method works. I think I've double-checked enough to be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression, so I can verify it another way. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution would be a_n = C*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check with our earlier calculations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recursive approach and verifying with a formula, the final result is computed as 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently, but since it's only nine layers, manually computing each step is manageable. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved time. Each layer seems to follow the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive formula, where each term depends on the previous one. If I can find a closed-form expression for Layer n, that might be faster. Let's see: The recursive relation is Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. We know that Layer 1 = 4. Plugging n=1 into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, let's compute Layer 2 using the general solution: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*Layer 1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Plugging n=2 into the general solution: 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we have a system of equations:\n1) 3A + B = 4\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5\n\nNow, plug A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values we have:\n\nFor n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works! So, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Use this result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4.

    "text": " ----------------- 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, reading the digits from bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, let me check that again because that seems a bit off. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, no carryover. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8. So the result is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Let's recompute each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12 \u2192 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, total 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: Break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3. Compute each part: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but when I computed Layer 9, I added 1 to 3*(Layer 8). So, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. To solve such a recurrence, we can find a closed-form formula. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B = 1 + 3B \u2192 0 = 1 + 2B \u2192 B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. Good. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches a_2=13. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer's value grows exponentially. Using the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps because when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure that each Layer computation was correct. Let me go back step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step. The original expression is 3*(...). So I computed the innermost layer as 4, then each subsequent layer up to 29524, then multiplied by 3. So yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, which matches my earlier computation. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...): Starting from the innermost, there are nine layers. So n=9. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9= 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So 3^{11}=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144 /2=88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, using the formula, I get 88572, which matches my step-by-step computation. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a formula for a linear recurrence relation.

Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. That's correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but I feel like that might not be the correct answer because I've seen similar problems before where the result is different. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nWait, I see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1\n\nSubstituting the general solution:\n\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Therefore, L_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I thought the answer might be different. Maybe I should check my calculations again. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expression step by step without using the formula to cross-verify.\n\nLet me compute each layer again manually:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I got before. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember a similar problem where the answer was different. Maybe I misremembered. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this expression as a geometric series.\n\nLooking back, each L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as 3*(L_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the recurrence relation and a derived formula, we confirm that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify using another method. 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me go back step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Wait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then each layer wraps around that.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is the first layer.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(first layer).\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(second layer), etc., until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. Then another 3( inside that.\n3. Continuing until the end.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3( terms. Let me see:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, there are eight more 3( terms before the last (1 + 3). So, perhaps there are nine layers in total. So, my initial calculation was correct with nine layers, from Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nSo, if I compute each layer correctly, then the final result is 88572. Hmm, but that seems like a very large number. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the layers.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me write that down.\n\nLet a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if this recursive formula is correct. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since this is a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general form of a linear recurrence relation is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c and d are constants.\n\nIn this case, c = 3 and d = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_0 - d/(1 - c)) * c^n + d/(1 - c), but since c \u2260 1.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula. For a recurrence relation a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1)\n\nWait, actually, let me make sure. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*c^n, and the particular solution is a constant since d is a constant. Let me assume a particular solution a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = c*K + d\n\nK - c*K = d\n\nK*(1 - c) = d\n\nK = d/(1 - c)\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*c^n + d/(1 - c)\n\nUsing the initial condition a_0, which in our case, a_1 = 4. Wait, but in the problem, a_1 is the first term after the innermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3 = 4. So, perhaps n starts at 1. Let me adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nSo, for n >= 1, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, the initial condition is a_1 = 4.\n\nTo find the closed-form, we can write:\n\na_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) * 1\n\nWait, but wait, I think I might be mixing up the indices. Let me set n=1 as the first term.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is:\n\na_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n} + d/(1 - c)\n\nWait, let's compute that.\n\nHere, c = 3, d = 1.\n\nSo, a_n = (a_1 - (1)/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n} + (1)/(1 - 3)\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (4 - (1)/(-2)) * 3^{n} + (1)/(-2)\n\nWhich is:\n\na_n = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n} - 1/2\n\nSo, a_n = (9/2) * 3^{n} - 1/2\n\nLet me check if this works for n=1:\n\na_1 = (9/2)*3^1 - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Wait, but a_1 is supposed to be 4. Hmm, that's not matching. So, I must have made a mistake in setting up the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should adjust the formula. Let me try again.\n\nThe general solution for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1).\n\nBut in our case, the initial term is a_1 = 4, so n starts at 1. Let me adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to set n=0 as the first term.\n\nLet me redefine: Let a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, for n >= 1, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, using the formula:\n\na_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1)\n\nHere, c=3, d=1, a_0=4.\n\nSo, a_n = 3^{n}*4 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1)*1\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = 4*3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nCombine terms:\n\na_n = (8*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (9*3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let's check for n=0: a_0 = (9*3^{0} - 1)/2 = (9*1 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (9*3^1 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (9*3^2 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n layers, a_n = (9*3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (9*3^9 -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our earlier step-by-step calculation, we found a_9 =29524.\n\nLet me compute using the formula: a_9 = (9*3^9 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, 9*19683 = 177147.\n\nThen, 177147 -1 = 177146.\n\nDivide by 2: 177146 / 2 = 88573.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed a_9 step by step, I got 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut according to this formula, a_9 = 88573, which would make the total expression 3*a_9 = 265719, which is way larger than before.\n\nWait, that's a problem. There must be a mistake here because my step-by-step calculation gave me a_9 =29524, and the formula is giving me a different result.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the formula, a_n = (9*3^{n} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers starting from a_0=4.\n\nWait, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1=4 up to a_9.\n\nSo, n=9 in the formula would correspond to a_9 = (9*3^9 -1)/2 = (9*19683 -1)/2 = (177147 -1)/2 = 177146/2=88573.\n\nBut in my step-by-step calculation, I had a_9=29524, which is way smaller than 88573. So, clearly, there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the step-by-step. Let me go back and check each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 =4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, a_9=29524.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9 should be 88573. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for n layers starting from a_0, but in our problem, we have 9 layers starting from a_1. So, perhaps n=9 in the formula corresponds to a_9, which would be (9*3^9 -1)/2=88573. But according to our step-by-step, a_9=29524, which is much smaller. So, clearly, I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm miscounting the layers. Let me see: the problem has 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine layers. Wait, no, let me count the number of times 3( occurs after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent 3( adds another layer. Let's count the number of 3( after the initial one:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3( inside that.\n3. Continuing until the last (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many 3( are there? Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3(, there are eight more 3( terms. So, total layers would be nine, from Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9 = (9*3^9 -1)/2=88573, but according to step-by-step, a_9=29524.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is wrong. Let me try to compute a_9 using the formula.\n\nWait, 3^9 is 19683.\n\nSo, 9*19683=177147.\n\n177147 -1=177146.\n\n177146/2=88573.\n\nBut according to step-by-step, a_9=29524.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but the step-by-step is wrong. Let me check the step-by-step again.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4.\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524.\n\nWait, 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9=88573, which is way larger.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula because the formula starts from n=0, whereas our problem starts from n=1.\n\nWait, let me adjust the formula.\n\nIf a_0=4, then a_1=(9*3^1 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which is correct.\n\na_2=(9*3^2 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\na_3=(9*3^3 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\na_4=(9*3^4 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\na_5=(9*3^5 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\na_6=(9*3^6 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\na_7=(9*3^7 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\na_8=(9*3^8 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\na_9=(9*3^9 -1)/2=(177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have only 9 layers, starting from a_1=4 up to a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9=88573, which would make the total expression 3*88573=265719, which is way too large.\n\nWait, this is confusing. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for a different indexing. Let me check the formula again.\n\nI think the confusion is that in the formula, a_n corresponds to n layers starting from a_0=4, but in our problem, we have 9 layers starting from a_1=4. So, perhaps in the formula, a_9 corresponds to 10 layers, which is not the case here.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nWait, in the formula, a_n is defined as the nth term, starting from a_0=4.\n\nSo, a_1 corresponds to 1 layer, a_2 to 2 layers, etc.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 would be the 9th term, which is (9*3^9 -1)/2=88573.\n\nBut according to our step-by-step, a_9=29524, which is actually a_8 in the formula.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer adds one more, so after 9 layers, it's a_9 in the formula.\n\nBut in our step-by-step, we have a_9=29524, which according to the formula should be a_8=29524, because a_8=(9*3^8 -1)/2=(9*6561 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nSo, a_8=29524, which is our a_9 in the problem. Therefore, the problem's a_9 corresponds to the formula's a_8.\n\nTherefore, the formula's a_8=29524, which matches our step-by-step.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*a_9, but in the formula, a_9=88573, which would be the value after 9 layers, but in our problem, we have only 8 layers beyond the initial 3*(...).\n\nWait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(layer), where layer has 8 layers inside. Wait, let me recount the layers in the problem.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds another 3*(...). Let's count the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(2)\n...\nUp to the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...).\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of such occurrences.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3*(1)\n3. 1 + 3*(2)\n...\nUp to the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3(, there are eight more 3( terms. So, total layers would be nine, from Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9=88573, but in our step-by-step, a_9=29524, which is a_8 in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that in the problem, the expression is 3*(layer), where layer is a_9, but according to the formula, a_9=88573, so the total would be 3*88573=265719.\n\nBut that contradicts our step-by-step, where we have a_9=29524 and total=88572.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I miscounted the layers in the problem.\n\nWait, let me try to see: if the formula's a_8=29524, then 3*a_8=88572, which matches our step-by-step.\n\nSo, perhaps in the problem, we have 8 layers inside the initial 3*(...), making the total layers 9 when including the initial one.\n\nWait, but according to the expression, the number of layers is 9, each starting with 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconcile this.\n\nWait, in the formula, a_n corresponds to n layers starting from a_0=4.\n\nSo, if our problem has 9 layers, then a_9=88573, and the total expression would be 3*a_9=265719.\n\nBut that contradicts our step-by-step.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem has 8 layers inside the initial 3*(...), then the total layers would be 9, but the innermost layer would be a_8=29524, so 3*a_8=88572.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has 9 layers, but the formula counts the initial 3*(... as layer 1, which would make the innermost layer a_9=29524.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the formula's a_1=4, which is the innermost.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nLet me consider that each time I compute a layer, I'm adding another 3*(...), so the number of layers corresponds to the number of times I can expand the expression.\n\nIn the problem, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write the expression with indices:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, Layer 9 is the innermost in terms of the formula, but in the problem, it's the outermost.\n\nWait, no, in the problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is the outermost layer, which is built from the innermost Layer 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the layers as being built from the inside out. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 2 wraps around Layer 1, etc., up to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression inside the initial 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is built from Layer 8, and so on.\n\nSo, according to the formula, a_n corresponds to n layers starting from a_1=4.\n\nThus, Layer 9 would be a_9=88573, and the total expression would be 3*a_9=265719.\n\nBut according to our step-by-step, a_9=29524, which is a_8 in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that in the formula, a_1=4, which is Layer 1, and each subsequent a_n adds another layer.\n\nSo, if we have 9 layers, then a_9=88573, and the total expression is 3*a_9=265719.\n\nBut in our step-by-step, we have only 9 layers, but the result is a_9=29524, which is a_8 in the formula. Therefore, perhaps the formula is misapplied.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me rederive it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that's different from what I had before. Let me check for n=1:\n\na_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nWait, so the correct formula is a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524, which matches our step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, which is the answer I got earlier.\n\nWait, so earlier, I thought that a_9=88573, but that was a mistake because I misapplied the formula. The correct formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThus, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me confirm once again by computing 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully working through the problem, checking each layer, and verifying with the closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed until the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result into the next layer.\n3. After computing all nine layers, the ninth layer is 29524.\n4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": "  \n________  \nMultiply each digit by 3 starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry over 0  \n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1  \n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8  \nSo, putting it together, we get 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3. Let's do it another way: 29524 * 3. 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. I can also notice that each layer is growing exponentially, which makes sense because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's similar to a geometric series, but nested. Alternatively, if I think of this as a recursive sequence, where each term is defined by a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), starting from a(1) = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. So, a(1) = 4  \na(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13  \na(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40  \na(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121  \na(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364  \na(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \na(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \na(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \na(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \nAnd then, the total expression is 3*a(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this as a base-3 number or something, but I don't think that's necessary here. Another way to verify is to compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error. Let's double-check a few layers: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f  \nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f  \nSo, each step checks out. Therefore, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check with another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n= 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that matches. So 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I computed Layer 9 correctly as 29,524. Let me go back through each layer to check for any calculation errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Therefore, 3*29524 = 88,572 is the final answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(...\" is a layer. Let me count: Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n... Up to 9 layers. So yes, Layer 9 is the outermost, and then we multiply by 3. So, yes, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nThis expression seems to follow a recursive pattern. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nI can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but let's check the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Good.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"(\" after the first 3 is a new layer. Let's count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, a_9 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I had used the formula, I could have computed a_9 directly as (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to compute the nested expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems to be correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's growing exponentially. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate coefficients: Coefficient of 3^n: A = A, which is always true. Constant term: B = 1 + 3B. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for a_n to compute a_9 directly, but since I was unsure at first, computing each layer step by step was a good way to verify. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break it down by evaluating each nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nThen, 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nThen, 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nThen, 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nThen, 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,7,5,2. So, 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3 is 88572? Let me confirm with another method. Let's compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nAdding 29524 + 29524: Let's compute 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1\n\n9 + 9 = 18 +1=19, write down 9, carry over 1\n\n2 + 2 = 4 +1=5\n\nSo, 29524 +29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, add another 29524: 59048 + 29524.\n\n59048 +29524:\n\n8 +4=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n4 +2=6 +1=7\n\n0 +5=5\n\n9 +9=18, write down 8, carry over 1\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8\n\nSo, the sum is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 *3=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, is that the final answer? Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers.\n\nLet me go back and check each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*(4)=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correctly computed. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the computation, though it seems correct.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1= A*3^1 + (-1/2) =3A -1/2=4.\n\nSolve for A: 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Let's think about it.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression, starting from the innermost, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If I expand all the parentheses, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nBut in this case, since it's nested nine times, it's a finite geometric series. Wait, but actually, the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the ninth term of the recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3))...)) with nine 1s.\n\nBut I think the recurrence approach was sufficient.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that each layer adds a power of 3. Since the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nSo, after verifying through multiple methods and checking each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me go back to the layers and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct up to Layer 9 being 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (Layer 9). So, yes, that would be 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = C*3^n + D\n\nWhere C and D are constants to be determined.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1\n\nSo, D = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 + D = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to see if that's correct.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 =9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nYes, correct. So, 3^{10} is 59049. Therefore, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThus, a_9=29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step again, just to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3:29524*3=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, since I found a general formula, I could have directly computed a_9 using the formula and then multiplied by 3, which would have saved time, but since I was verifying each step, it's better to compute each layer to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\nIn conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find each layer's value. Using the general formula derived, each layer a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, 3*364 is 1,092? Let me check: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1,080 +12=1,092. So, 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 1,093 * 3: 1,000*3=3,000; 90*3=270; 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3,280 *3: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 9,841 *3: 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 +3=29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions, maybe a geometric series or something. Let me explore that for a moment. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. That's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. That matches what I got earlier. So, then the total expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, the sum can be represented as a geometric series. But in this case, since each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term, it's a bit different. However, the recurrence approach worked well. Let me just verify the computation of 3^10 to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. 3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2,187\n\n3^8 = 6,561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59,049. Therefore, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. So, everything checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer until we reach the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation approach confirms the result. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses and work outward.\n2. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer.\n3. After computing each layer up to the ninth layer, multiply the result by 3.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " ___________ 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 *3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone. I could also represent this recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*f(9). Let's compute f(n) for n=1 to 9:\n\nf(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So each layer is one more than the previous, starting from 1 + 3, then each time adding another layer. So, yes, 9 layers, which I labeled as Layer 1 through Layer 9.\n\nSo, the computation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in this case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on up to a_9, which would be the value inside the outermost parentheses, then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), so the total is 3*a_9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve it step by step. Let's compute the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as we can see, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nBut in our case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} =177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form expression, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me recompute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from left to right: 8,8,5,7,2.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, breaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recursive formula, and then applying a closed-form expression, I conclude that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2.

Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Wait, that's 88572? Wait, let me verify. 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo reading from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2 \u2192 88572. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048.\n\n79048 + 9524: 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have nested expressions, you might have to consider whether each layer is correctly computed. Let me make sure I didn't skip any layers. Let's count the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a \"3(...)\", so each layer is one more set. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer, since the expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, but when I did the layers, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula to compute it without expanding each layer. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nWait, let me see the pattern between layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented as:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nWith L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for L(n). Let's try that.\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p(n) = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I have:\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works for each layer.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is the entire expression 3 times Layer 9? Because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(Layer 9). So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*L(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Exactly the same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without expanding each layer, which is much more efficient.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} to confirm:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nYes, correct. So, 3^{11} =177147, then 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(L(n) = 1 + 3L(n-1)\\) with \\(L(1) = 4\\). Solving this recurrence, we find a general formula for the \\(n\\)-th layer as \\(L(n) = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives \\(L(9) = 29524\\). Multiplying by 3, the final result is \\(88572\\).\n\n\\boxed{88572}"
