    "text": " = Let's compute each digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: Let me compute it step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, so digit is 2, carryover 1.\n- Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, so digit is 7, carryover 0.\n- Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, digit is 5, carryover 1.\n- Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, digit is 8, carryover 2.\n- Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, digit is 8.\n\nSo, writing it from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. So the result is 88572. Let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n88548 + 24 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait a minute, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure that I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3=363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840 + 0 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed earlier. Hmm, seems consistent. I think I did this correctly, but just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. It seems like each layer is following the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. In this case, c = 1, r = 3. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (c*r^{n} - r)/(r - 1). Wait, let me make sure. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^n, and the particular solution can be found using the method for linear recurrences. Alternatively, for the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the solution can be expressed as a_n = 3^{n} + something. Let me try to compute the first few terms to see the pattern.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nI notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Wait, actually, in our case, it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is the same as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the general solution for this recurrence relation is known. The standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r \u2260 1. The solution is a_n = (c/(r - 1)) * (r^{n} - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but in our case, a_1 is given as 4. Let me adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nWait, actually, the standard solution for a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nBut in our case, the recurrence starts at n=1, with a_1 = 4. So, perhaps it's better to adjust the indices. Let me let n = 1 correspond to a_1 = 4, and n = 9 correspond to a_9 = 29524.\n\nSo, using the formula:\n\na_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nBut in our case, a_1 = 4, so a_0 would be a_{-1}? Hmm, maybe this approach is complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the solution as a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, left-hand side: A*3^{n} + B\n\nSet equal: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's take n=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, this confirms the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nI think this is solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach also leads to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Yep, same result. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me go back through my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that should be the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Perhaps this expression is a geometric series or follows some pattern that can be expressed in a formula, which might save time instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nBut maybe there's a formula for a_n in terms of a geometric progression. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and then finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for a_9, which is the outermost layer, n=9.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the original expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer, which might be faster for larger numbers of layers.\n\nBut since in this problem there are only nine layers, computing each step was manageable. However, knowing the formula could be helpful if there were more layers or if I needed a general solution.\n\nIn summary, the problem required expanding a deeply nested expression by working from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each layer step by step, and then multiplying the outermost result by 3. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to derive a formula for the nth term, which could then be used to compute the result more efficiently, especially for larger n.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by expanding the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each layer step by step, and then multiplying the final result by 3. Each layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. After computing each layer up to a_9, we find a_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, let me find the particular solution.\n\nAssume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = r*K + c => K = r*K + c => K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r).\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + K.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*r^1 + K => 4 = A*3 + K.\n\nBut K = c/(1 - r) = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, 4 = 3*A - 1/2 => 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it without going through each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this problem, since there are only nine layers, computing step by step is manageable, though a bit time-consuming.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, we can compute each layer or even find a closed-form expression to jump directly to the result.\n\nIn conclusion, the final answer after computing all the layers and multiplying by the outermost 3 is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find each layer's value step by step. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 2 first: 29524 * 2 = 59048. Then add 29524 to that: 59048 + 29524.\n\nAdding 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n88548 + 24 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until the 9th layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me see: Each time we have a (1+3(...)), so how many times does this occur?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3.\n\nThen, Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer 1).\n\nLayer 3 is 1+3*(Layer 2).\n\nContinuing up to Layer 9, which would be the outermost before the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the structure is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I have 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), then the final result is 3*(Layer 9). So, with each layer correctly computed as above, ending at Layer 9 = 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in one of the layers. Let me verify each step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute Layer 9 again:\n\nLayer 8: 9841.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute that.\n\n9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: As before, 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, a_1 is 4, a_2 is 13, a_3 is 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nNow, set equal to left side:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, as before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistake in the formula, let me check a_5.\n\nUsing the formula: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the formula is correct.\n\nThus, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer and applying the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(inner expression), repeated nine times, with an outer multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check that again. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, so digit is 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15, digit 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, digit 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the number is 88572.

Let's add them:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add step by step.\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 24 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nOkay, so Layer 9 is indeed 29524, so 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake because the numbers get so large so quickly. Let me try computing a few layers again to verify.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(something). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, no, in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*(3)^n. The particular solution can be found as a constant. Let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. So, then the original expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, we arrive at the same result, confirming that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expressed as a geometric progression. The total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the 9th term in this sequence.\n\nSo, after verifying through both step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought, each time we're doing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So maybe I should have started with the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 2 is the next one out, etc., up to Layer 9 being the innermost. Wait, no, in the problem, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that, so when I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, that's correct. So the steps are correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: It's a geometric series or something similar. Let's see.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, a_1 is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the recurrence. Let me verify for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, it's 3^{10}=59049, so (59049 -1)/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThus, 3*29524=88572. So yes, that's the correct answer.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading to the final value of 29524 before multiplying by 3. The result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{another similar term})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Parentheses**: Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Work Outward Layer by Layer**:\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\).\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\).\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\).\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\).\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\).\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\).\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ". Let's compute each digit:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo reading from top to bottom, it's 8,8,7,5,2. Wait, that seems off. Wait, let's do it step by step:\n\nStart with the units digit: 4 * 3 = 12. So, units place is 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 (tens place) * 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 is 7. So, tens place is 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 (hundreds place) * 3 = 15. So, hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 (thousands place) * 3 = 27, plus carryover 1 is 28. So, thousands place is 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 (ten-thousands place) * 3 = 6, plus carryover 2 is 8. So, ten-thousands place is 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo putting it all together, from ten-thousands to units: 8,8,7,5,2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 would be 88572. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up:\n\n29524\n+29524\n=59048\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572\n\nYes, so 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check that computation because that seems high. Let me go back step by step to see if I made an error in computing the layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check again each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a pattern here that could have been recognized earlier, maybe a geometric series or something? Because computing each layer step by step seems tedious, but perhaps there's a formula that could have been applied. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the structure: each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nAt n=1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that formula works. So, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*L_9, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nThis confirms that the result is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors when using the formula approach. So, 3^11 is 177147, right? Let's compute 3^11:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, 3^11 - 3 = 177147 - 3 = 177144\n\nDivide by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by working from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe start by computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Therefore, we compute:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly computed Layer 9 as 29524. Because each layer is built by computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous computations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correctly computed. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572, which should be the final answer. Wait, but let me just make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)) with nine layers, right? Let me count the opening parentheses in the original expression to confirm.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.

So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. Therefore, my computation seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but I might be misremembering. Wait, let me think again. The standard form for a linear recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. In this case, r = 3 and c = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(r - 1))*(r^{n} - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with the initial condition. Here, a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, as we computed earlier. Wait, no, actually, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, so perhaps a_0 would be 1? Wait, maybe I should index the layers differently. Let me define a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. The general solution for this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nIf a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2, then for n=0, a_0 = (1 - 1)/2 = 0, which doesn't match our a_0 = 1. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach. Alternatively, the solution to a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found by iterating the recurrence.\n\nLet's write out the first few terms:\n\na_0 = 1\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, a_9 is 29524, as we computed earlier. Now, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might help in computing it without iterating each layer. Let's try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_0 = 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_0 = 1.\n\na_0 = A*3^0 + (-1/2) = A - 1/2 = 1.\n\nThus, A = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=0: a_0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. Correct.\n\nn=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have a_9, which is the 9th term, so n=9.\n\nCompute a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked each step and even found a formula to confirm the result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, 88,572 is the correct result.\n\nWait, but in my earlier digit-by-digit calculation, I had 88572, which is 88,572. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine layers of 1+3(...), right?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each opening parenthesis is part of a new layer. Let's see: Starting with 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) adds a new layer. Let's count the number of layers:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 1\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 2\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2192 3\n4. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 4\n5. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 5\n6. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 6\n7. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 7\n8. 3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 8\n9. 3(1+3)))))) \u2192 9\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers. So, I computed up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with n layers. It seems like each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me denote the value of the k-th layer as a_k, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on, up to a_9, then the total expression is 3a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_{k} = 1 + 3a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_k.\n\nThe recurrence is a_k = 3a_{k-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_k - 3a_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3A + 1 \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, that confirms that the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I used both iterative computation and a closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, and both gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 \u00d73 again, just to be thorough.\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d73 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d73 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d73 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d73 = 60\n\n4 \u00d73 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps the way I computed it is correct because I started from the innermost and worked my way out, each time computing the next layer. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous recurrence: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 \u21d2 r = 3.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

But let me check each multiplication step to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo writing it out: 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 * 3 another way. Maybe using another method to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So each layer n can be expressed as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_{n-1} is the result of the previous layer. This seems like a recursive sequence.\n\nIn fact, this is a geometric series or perhaps can be modeled using a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + initial term.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for such a recurrence. If we have a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, then the solution is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). But in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nWait, but let me check: Our initial term is a_1 = 4, right? Because the innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, using the formula for a linear recurrence:\n\na_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nBut in our case, a_1 = 4, and the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 for n >= 2.\n\nWait, so the general formula would be:\n\na_n = 3^{n-1} * a_1 + 1*(3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1)\n\nBecause the standard formula is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), but in our case, a_1 is the starting point, so perhaps we need to adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the recurrence starting from a_0.\n\nLet me redefine the sequence:\n\nLet a_0 = 1 (the innermost 1 before any multiplication by 3). Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculations.\n\nSo, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nTo find A and B, we can use the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_0 = 1:\n\na_0 = C*3^{0} - 1/2 = C - 1/2 = 1\n\nSo C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, since we have 9 layers from a_0 to a_9, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation of Layer 9 being 29524. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we found before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, by recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, I was able to derive a formula that gives the value of each layer without computing each step manually. This formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, allowed me to compute a_9 directly, which saved time and reduced the chance of error. Then, multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't recognize the pattern, computing each layer step by step would have worked, but it's more time-consuming and error-prone, especially with more layers. So, it's good to identify such patterns when possible.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying using a recurrence relation, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize it as a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication by 3:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: Each time I see a (1 + 3(...)), that's a layer. Let me count the number of layers in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3)\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nContinuing this way, each time adding another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3\n\nThen Layer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1+3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 1+3(Layer8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers inside, then multiplied by 3. So, my computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 13\n\nLayer3: 40\n\nLayer4: 121\n\nLayer5: 364\n\nLayer6: 1093\n\nLayer7: 3280\n\nLayer8: 9841\n\nLayer9: 29524\n\nI can see that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1.\n\nThis is similar to a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 3, but with an added constant. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it as follows.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) =3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and saved time, but since the problem wasn't too long, computing each layer step by step was manageable.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods (step-by-step and closed-form) gave me the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by repeatedly substituting from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value at each stage until reaching the outermost layer, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. There are nine such layers inside the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the result is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Each layer's result is correct, and the final multiplication is correct. So, I think the answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem from a different angle, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern that could simplify the computation. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form: 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. The recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works for the first few layers. So, using this formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but the structure is a bit different because each term is built by multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is more like a geometric progression with a constant addition. But since I already have a closed-form solution, I think that's sufficient.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By working from the innermost layer outward, either by iterative computation or by finding a closed-form formula, I determined that the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number. The recurrence relation is:\n\n\\[ a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\]\n\nwith the initial condition \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Each layer's computation seems to follow logically, and each step checks out. So, I think 88572 is the right answer. I was a bit worried because the numbers get large quickly, but since each step is just multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it makes sense that the numbers would grow exponentially. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I recall that expressions of the form a + a(a + a(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nLooking at the innermost expression, it's 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. Specifically, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and such relations can often be solved using closed-form expressions. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = C*a^{n} + d, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions, and d is the particular solution when L_n is constant.\n\nIn this case, a = 3 and b = 1. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution, which is the solution to L_n = 3*L_{n-1}. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (b=1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say d. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nd = 3*d + 1\n\nSolving for d:\n\nd - 3d = 1 => -2d =1 => d = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works for the first few layers. So, for Layer 9, which is L_9, we can compute:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572, as previously calculated. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. It's interesting to see how the recurrence relation approach confirms the step-by-step computation. I think this problem is a good example of how recognizing patterns and using recurrence relations can simplify what initially looks like a complex nested expression. It also shows the power of mathematical induction and formula derivation in solving such problems efficiently, especially if the number of layers were much larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually was manageable, though time-consuming. I wonder if there's another way to think about this problem, maybe using binary or another base, but I don't see an immediate connection. Alternatively, perhaps using exponentiation by squaring or another exponentiation technique, but given that each layer is just a simple multiplication and addition, the step-by-step approach seems the most straightforward.

Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So adding up the products: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that matches. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a geometric progression or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 As we saw earlier. Now, let's see if we can model this with a formula. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2 = 81/2 -1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinal result: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together: 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, the step-by-step approach is manageable. Alternatively, noticing that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my previous calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem and see if the formula works. Let's say, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, using the formula: The number of layers here is 3. So, L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Then, 3*L_3 = 120. Which matches. So, the formula works for a smaller case. Therefore, confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each of the nine layers. Using the formula derived from the linear recurrence relation, the value of the ninth layer is found to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nSo each layer seems correct. Then, 3\u00d729524=88572. So that's the final answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is 3(1+3(...)), so after computing the innermost parentheses, each layer is built upon the previous one, and the final result is 3 times the outermost layer. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nLayer4:121\n\nLayer5:364\n\nLayer6:1093\n\nLayer7:3280\n\nLayer8:9841\n\nLayer9:29524\n\nI can see that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each term can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost layer is Layer9, which is a_9. So a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step, which is much faster and less error-prone.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Let me test it again with n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, as I had earlier.\n\nSimilarly, n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula seems solid.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10} and compute it as 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo that's another way to look at it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

So the number is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 30000 * 3 = 90000. But 29524 is 30000 - 476. So 30000*3 = 90000, then subtract 476*3 = 1428. So 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Maybe there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nThen, the sequence goes: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, etc.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B \u2192 B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check that for n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nYes, that works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to see this pattern. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to a geometric series, but with a twist because each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1.\n\nWait, but the closed-form formula seems to have worked, so maybe that's the most efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as starting with the innermost term and working outward, but since we've already computed it step by step, perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nWait, another thought: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. So, if I think of it as a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's another way to look at it.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by using the closed-form formula, so I'm confident that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5.

Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then subtract 476 * 3, because 30,000 - 476 = 29,524. So, 90,000 - (476 * 3). 476 * 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but hold on.

Yes, because 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048, and adding another 29,524 gives 88,572. So that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me explore that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier computation of Layer 9.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form solution from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. Each step checks out, and the closed-form solution confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a geometric progression. Using a recurrence relation, we find the closed-form solution for each layer and then compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from the innermost (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see the pattern.\n\nFrom L1 to L2: 4 to 13, which is 4*3 +1=13\n\nFrom L2 to L3: 13*3 +1=40\n\nFrom L3 to L4: 40*3 +1=121\n\nYes, so each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1=4.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^(h) = C*3^{n}\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution L_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. At n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier values:\n\nFor n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, L9=29524.\n\nThen, the final answer is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3^{n+1} for n=9 to make sure.\n\n3^{10}=59049, so L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm it's 59049.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, L9=29524.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the layer values. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is computed step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. The final result after computing all layers and multiplying by 3 is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I let x be the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*x, where x is the next layer. But in this case, since it's a finite number of layers, maybe 9 layers, it's a finite geometric series. Alternatively, I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since it's a simple recurrence, we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume the particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have computed each layer step by step as I did earlier, and I got the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying using a closed-form solution, I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4.

So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine layers, right? Let me count the number of times I've computed each layer. I started with Layer 1 as the innermost, and went up to Layer 9, each time computing the next layer. So, that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. That seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors.\n\n- Recognized the nested structure and decided to compute from the innermost layer.\n\n- Computed each layer step by step, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time using the previous layer's result.\n\n- Then, after computing Layer 9, multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n- To verify, I derived a general formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations, which confirmed that Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\n- Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nAdding units: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carryover 1\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n0 + 5 = 5\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carryover 1\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\nSo, 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me check the layers again because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, but perhaps I made an error in computing the layers.\n\nWait, let's go back step by step to ensure each layer is correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers or the steps. Let me recount the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nYes, that's nine layers, each correctly computed. So, the outermost layer is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. The expression inside each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, and going up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1 into the general solution:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we're dealing with a_9, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed before. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check the computation again. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each layer again step by step to confirm.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). If I expand the entire expression, maybe it's a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let's think about it. Let me try to represent the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E. So, E = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) up to nine layers. Wait, but maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, since we've already solved it using the step-by-step method and verified with the recurrence relation, perhaps it's best to stick with the answer we have.\n\nWait, but let me just check the multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again, in case I made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Correct.\n\nOkay, I think I've double-checked each step, and everything seems consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, especially with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers or make an arithmetic error. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe for a small number of terms, it's easier to compute each step as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express L_n in terms of L_{n-1} and find a closed-form formula. Let's try that.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found as a constant, say L_p.\n\nAssume L_p is a constant, so L_p = 1 + 3*L_p \u21d2 L_p - 3*L_p = 1 \u21d2 -2*L_p = 1 \u21d2 L_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3A \u21d2 A - 3A =1 \u21d2 -2A=1 \u21d2 A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Wait, but in our earlier computation, Layer 1 was a_1=4, which corresponds to n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nSo, for a_9, which is Layer 9, we have a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3^10 is indeed 59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThus, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3^10 again just to be sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result as computing each layer step by step. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer adds another factor of 3, so the total expression is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. But since the expression is nested, it's a bit different, but the closed-form approach worked well.\n\nI think I've double-checked my work enough times. Each step seems consistent, both by direct computation and by using the recurrence relation formula. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to Layer 9, we get 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute each nested layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, just to confirm. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_{n-1} is the previous layer. So, if I denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We need another equation, but since the recurrence is non-homogeneous with a constant term, the particular solution is a constant. Let's assume B is a constant. Let me solve for A and B. From the recurrence relation, a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Using the general solution a_n = A*3^n + B, substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + B - 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1. Simplify: A*3^n + B - 3A*3^{n-1} - 3B = 1. The term A*3^n - 3A*3^{n-1} simplifies to A*3^{n-1}(3 - 3) = 0. So, we're left with B - 3B = -2B = 1. Therefore, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer up to a_9=29524. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} to see if that's correct. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. That's the same result as before. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier when computing each layer. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which resembles a geometric progression. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, substituting the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, we have: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that this is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let's go through each layer again to confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for such nested expressions. Sometimes, these kinds of problems can be represented as geometric series or use a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. But just for knowledge, the recurrence relation L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let's see: The homogeneous solution would be L(n) = A*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9, L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer again. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 plus three times the previous layer. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute each digit:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nWait, that would give us 88572. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n- Next digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7 \u2192 write 7\n- Next digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n- Next digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n- Next digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because the numbers seem to be growing very rapidly, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer to confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, each layer is correctly calculated, and the final multiplication by 3 is accurate. Therefore, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series, perhaps? Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n \u2265 2.\n\nSo, we have a recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nAt n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that formula works perfectly. So, each layer L_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute the final answer without calculating each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually is feasible, though time-consuming. It's good to know the general formula for future reference.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations when applying the formula. For n=9, 3^{10} is 59049, right? Because 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, yes, 3^{10}=59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the entire expression: since the expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=3*59049=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is correct. It's always good to cross-verify using different methods to avoid any mistakes, especially with such a nested and repetitive expression.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 =40. Hmm, this looks familiar. Wait, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me assume a particular solution is a constant A. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A =1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, after 9 layers, we have a term a_9, and the total expression is 3*a_9. As we saw, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the total is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step checks out, and the formula approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Calculating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost and then applying the final multiplication by 3 yields the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Final Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification Using Recurrence Relation:**\n   Recognizing the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), the general solution is \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n = 9\\):\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n   Then, the total expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, but let me check if my layers were correctly computed because that seems like a large number, and maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nLet me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo each layer is correct, so 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting big, and I might have missed a step. Let me try computing the layers again but perhaps using a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, then the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire inner expression, which is a_9. So, yes, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me substitute into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nThen, a_{n} = A*3^{n} + B\n\na_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2192 correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for a_9, which is Layer 9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2192 which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to Layer 9, which gives 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that, resulting in 88572.\n\nI also used a formula approach by recognizing the recurrence relation, which led me to the same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing the nested pattern in the expression and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a moment. Let me verify my earlier steps because I feel like I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again, just to be sure.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me think again. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This recursive structure suggests that each layer can be represented as a geometric series or perhaps using a formula for such a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps it can help us compute a_9 more efficiently.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression without breaking it down into layers, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if there's a telescoping effect or another pattern, but given that the layers are straightforward, I think the step-by-step approach is the most reliable.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to recognize that each layer is essentially a geometric series. For example, if we consider the innermost term, it's 1 + 3. The next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is 1 + 3 + 3*3. The next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3*3), which is 1 + 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3, and so on. So, each layer adds another term in the geometric series with ratio 3. Therefore, after n layers, the expression would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nBut wait, in our case, each layer is multiplied by 3 before adding 1, so it's not exactly a straightforward geometric series. However, the formula we derived earlier using the recurrence relation is more accurate.\n\nIn any case, since both methods\u2014direct computation and using the recurrence formula\u2014lead us to the same result, I feel confident that the final answer is correct.\n\nWait, just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step without using the formula, just to cross-verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with everything else. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing one of the layers again, say Layer 5.\n\nLayer 4 was 121, so Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, everything checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've gone through this problem thoroughly, checking each step and even using a different method (the recurrence relation) to confirm the result. It seems solid, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

But let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake earlier when computing each layer.\n\nLet me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let's break it down:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nSo 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 +3=29523\n\nSo 3*9841=29523\n\nThen Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo the total inside the parentheses is 29524, then multiplied by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm 29524*3 once again because sometimes when I do it quickly, I might make a mistake.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\n5 * 3 =15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 =27 +1=28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 =6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is built upon the previous. So in the given expression, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9, which is the outermost, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers inside the 3 multiplier. So, each step up to Layer 9, and then 3 times that.\n\nSo, yes, I think my calculations are correct. Each layer's value was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression seems to be of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such a structure. Let me see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, yes, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence relation, we find that \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make an error in calculation.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the multiplication. 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the expression starts with 3*(...), so the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. Let me confirm that I correctly accounted for all layers. Each time, I computed each layer as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous). So after nine layers, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9, which is then multiplied by 3. So, yes, the process is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, then L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe recurrence relation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging in the recurrence:\n\nL(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1\n\nSubstitute the general solution:\n\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nBring terms together:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\nL(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9 (since we have 9 layers), L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the final answer is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^11:\n\n3^10 = 59049, so 3^11 = 59049 * 3 = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it directly using the formula, which gives the same result.\n\nSo, either way, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. After computing all layers, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times, with the entire expression multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The outermost operation is multiplying Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**:  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"
