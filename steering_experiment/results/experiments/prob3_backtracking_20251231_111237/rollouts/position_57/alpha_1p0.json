Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them:\n\n29524\n+29524\n=59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which could save me time in the future. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from n=3, each layer is 1 + 3n. Maybe this is a geometric series or something else.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, where a1 = 1 + 3 = 4,\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13,\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40,\n\nand so on up to a9.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_{k+1} = 1 + 3*a_k, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_{k+1} = 3*a_k + 1, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_{k+1} = 3*a_k, whose solution is a_k = C*3^{k}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nAssume a_p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_k = C*3^{k} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When k=1, a1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, starting from a1 to a9, let's compute a9.\n\na9 = (3^{9+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. The closed-form approach using the recurrence relation confirms that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work to ensure accuracy. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13  \n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40  \n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121  \n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364  \n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093  \n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280  \n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841  \n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the result:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's a formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4.\n\nWait, actually, starting from the innermost, which is a_1=1+3=4.\n\nThen a_2=1+3*a_1=1+12=13.\n\na_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40.\n\nYes, so it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C -3C =1 \u21d2 -2C=1 \u21d2 C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nWait, but let's check: when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula seems correct.\n\nSo, for layer 9, which is a_9, n=9.\n\na_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, yes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly, which would have saved time. But since I was computing step by step, it worked out.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is building up a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, it's a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nBut in this case, since the expression is finite (nine layers), using the formula for a_n was helpful.\n\nI think I've got it. The answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Started by computing each layer from the inside out.\n- Each layer was computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n- Did this nine times, starting from 4, then 13, 40, etc., up to 29524.\n- Then multiplied the final layer by 3 to get 88572.\n- Verified using a recurrence relation formula that the ninth layer is indeed 29524.\n- Thus, the final result is 88572.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe label each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or some recursive pattern. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, let's compute the terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this method also leads to the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I might consider if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, in our case, a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. Let me adjust the indices properly. Sometimes, it's easier to index starting at n=0, but in this case, let's stick with n=1.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nThis method also confirms the result. Therefore, I can be absolutely sure that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the problem as repeatedly applying the operation 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to building a number in base 3 or something, but I think the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method are sufficient.\n\nJust to recap, the process was:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation.\n\n3. Realize that each layer follows a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved with a formula.\n\n4. Use the formula to compute the 9th layer directly, then multiply by 3.\n\n5. Verify the result through multiple methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. It also reinforced the importance of checking work through alternative methods to avoid errors.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Recognizing the recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer and compute the 9th layer, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinal result: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3.

Earlier, I thought Layer 6 was 1093, but when I computed Layer 6 as 1 + 3*364, that's 1 + 1092, which is 1093, correct. Then Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093 \u00d7 3: 1000 \u00d7 3 = 3000, 93 \u00d73=279, so total is 3279. Then 3279 +1=3280, correct. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280 \u00d73: 3000\u00d73=9000, 280\u00d73=840, so total 9840. Then 9840 +1=9841, correct. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841 \u00d73: 9000\u00d73=27,000, 800\u00d73=2,400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 +120=29,520; 29,520 +3=29,523. Then, 29,523 +1=29,524, correct.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I computed Layer 9 correctly. Because if I messed up any of the layers, the final answer would be wrong. Let me go back and check each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(...), and the innermost part is 1+3, which is 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I have nine layers, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved using the formula for a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth term.\n\nLet's define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recursions.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence. The general solution can be found using the formula:\n\na_n = (a_1 - c/(b-1)) * b^{n-1} + c/(b-1)\n\nwhere the recurrence is of the form a_n = b*a_{n-1} + c.\n\nIn this case, b = 3 and c = 1.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\na_n = (4 - 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(3-1)\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2\n\na_n = (7/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2\n\nSo, for n = 9:\n\na_9 = (7/2)*3^{8} + 1/2\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (7/2)*6561 + 1/2\n\nCompute (7/2)*6561:\n\nFirst, 7 * 6561 = ?\n\nCompute 7 * 6000 = 42000\n\n7 * 500 = 3500\n\n7 * 61 = 427\n\nWait, 6561 is 6000 + 500 + 61.\n\nSo, 7 * 6000 = 42000\n\n7 * 500 = 3500\n\n7 * 61 = 427\n\nAdding them up: 42000 + 3500 = 45500; 45500 + 427 = 45927.\n\nSo, 7 * 6561 = 45927.\n\nThen, (7/2)*6561 = 45927 / 2 = 22963.5\n\nThen, add 1/2: 22963.5 + 0.5 = 22964.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed layer by layer, I got a_9 = 29524. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's check the formula again. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nThe general solution for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is indeed a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find B, set a_n = B, then B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThen, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nAh, there we go! So, using the correct formula, a_9 = 29524, which matches the step-by-step computation I did earlier. So, my initial formula was incorrect because I might have misapplied the general solution. But now, using the correct method, I get a_9 = 29524, which is consistent with the step-by-step approach.\n\nTherefore, the final computation is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that 3^10 is indeed 59049. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3 * 29524 manually.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I double-checked each step, made sure the formula was applied correctly, and even cross-verified the multiplication. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer and then multiplying the outermost result by 3, we arrive at the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, if I have nine layers, does that mean I have nine sets of 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost? Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is another 1 + 3(...).

So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression, each 1 + 3(...) is nested inside another, and I think there are nine such layers, as I numbered them from 1 to 9. So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9, which is then multiplied by 3.

So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each layer, and the final multiplication. It all adds up correctly.

So, putting it together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's see what the homogeneous solution is. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as repeatedly multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series. Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each time, we're adding another layer of 1 + 3*(...). This is similar to building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Anyway, the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach both give me the same result, so I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 88572. Let me just verify the multiplication one more time to be absolutely sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

There's a discrepancy here. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method.\n\nLet's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88,572. So my initial digit-by-digit multiplication had an error. I think I misplaced the digits when writing them down.\n\nWait, let me correct that. When I did the digit-by-digit, I think I wrote the digits in the wrong order. Let me do it again carefully:\n\nMultiplying 29524 by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, no carryover.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo writing the digits from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8.\n\nWait, that would be 88,572, right? Because the first digit is 2 (units place), then 7 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 8 (thousands), 8 (ten-thousands). So the number is 88,572.\n\nYes, that matches the breakdown method. So I must have made a mistake in the initial digit-by-digit by not correctly placing the digits. So the correct result is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that all the layers were computed correctly before that. Let me go back through each layer to check for any possible errors.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*(Layer 9) again. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000. So, 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500. So, 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60. So, 88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n4 * 3 = 12. So, 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29,524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nEach multiplied by 3:\n\n20,000 *3=60,000\n\n9,000 *3=27,000\n\n500 *3=1,500\n\n20 *3=60\n\n4 *3=12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYep, same result.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Maybe there's a geometric series or something here. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the expression: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form for such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which in this case is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. Alternatively, since it's a first-order recurrence, I can solve it iteratively.\n\nLet me try expanding a few terms to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nHmm, these numbers look familiar. Let me see if they match any known sequence. Alternatively, maybe I can express L_n in terms of powers of 3.\n\nLooking at the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is similar to a geometric series. Let's try to express L_n in terms of L_1.\n\nExpanding:\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_1) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*L_1\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2*L_1) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*L_1\n\nContinuing this pattern, it seems that:\n\nL_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + (3^{n})*L_1 /3^{n-1}\n\nWait, perhaps that's more complicated than it needs to be. Alternatively, since L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can write it as:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n\n-2*A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier values.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nL_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since it's only 9 layers, both methods work. It's good to know that there's a formula here, though, because it can save time in the future.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n2. Compute each layer step by step, which gives L_9 =29524.\n3. Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 88572.\n4. Alternatively, derive a formula for L_n using recurrence relations, confirming that L_9 =29524, leading to the same final result.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each step and verifying with both iterative computation and a derived formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a recursive sequence. By calculating each layer step by step, we find the innermost value and work our way outward. Finally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to obtain the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check my calculations again because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, but that's not the correct way to break it down because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, so 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, in case I made a mistake in the repetitive computation. Let's see, each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4. This looks like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Layer n. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is: a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let me substitute the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Now, set the left and right sides equal: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4, let's find A. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is: a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, this confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. If I expand this expression, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to express it that way. Starting from the innermost term: Let me denote the innermost as S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. S_3 = 1 + 3*S_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to S_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*S_9. As I found earlier, S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. So, 3*S_9 = 88572. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression as a sum, each multiplication by 3 adds another term. Let me see: The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1))). Wait, but in the original problem, the innermost is 1 + 3, not 1 + 3*1. Hmm, maybe that approach isn't directly applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a sum where each term is 3^k, but I'm not sure. Let me think: Each time we have a 1 added and then multiplied by 3. So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand this, it would be 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to 9 terms, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Wait, let's try expanding it step by step. Let me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me compute E step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Let me assign each nested expression to a variable:\n\nLet me define:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nE = 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier computation. Alternatively, since each En = 1 + 3*E(n-1), starting from E1 = 4, and this is a linear recurrence, as I solved earlier, leading to En = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and E = 3*E9 = 88572. So, all methods point to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the result:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that would be 88,572? Wait, no, the digits are 8 (from the first carry), then 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me do it step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, no carry.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28.

So:\n\n- Units digit: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n- Tens digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, no carry.\n- Hundreds digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, no carry.\n\nSo the result is 88,572? Wait, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572? Let me check with another method. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048; then add another 29,524: 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3: 20,000 *3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. So adding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; +1,500=88,500; +60=88,560; +12=88,572. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )) with nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, I computed up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. The expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), which can be expanded as 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). But since I already have the closed-form solution, it's easier to use that.\n\nSo, to recap, by either computing each layer step by step or finding the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That looks like a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, maybe? Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, the solution is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + L_0, where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, actually, let me think again. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^h = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => 0 = 1 + 2*L_p => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For Layer 1 (n=1): L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2 (n=2): L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. Layer 3 (n=3): L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Layer 4 (n=4): L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9 (n=9): L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression using the formula I derived. The original expression is 3*(L_9). Since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the original expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. That's a more efficient way, using the formula instead of computing each layer. So, in summary, by recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, I can find a closed-form expression for each layer, compute the 9th layer, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.

Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me compute 29524 * 3 another way to verify. 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 90000 - 1000 = 89000, 89000 - 428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(...), so I think I have to multiply the entire expression by 3, which is the outermost operation. So, yes, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, maybe.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, Layer 2 would be a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which also matches.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which is correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is exactly what we computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute each layer without manually stepping through each one, which is much more efficient, especially if there are many layers. But since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the formula again. The general solution was a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^10 - 1)/2 = 59049 - 1 = 59048 / 2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.

The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, yes, nine layers in total. So, my computation up to Layer 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute it without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations when applying the formula. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=9, that's (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048.\n\n59048 divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but in this case, the expression is a linear recurrence, so the formula I used earlier is appropriate.\n\nSo, I think I've double-checked my work, and everything seems consistent.

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. First, find the homogeneous solution, then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand the entire expression, perhaps I can represent it as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try that. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. If I expand this, starting from the innermost, it's similar to a geometric series. Let me see: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3s. Each layer adds another 3 multiplication. Since there are 9 layers inside, each time we have 3^k terms. Alternatively, maybe I can think of E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series with ratio 3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the formula we derived earlier, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then E = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, E = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So that's another way to get the same result, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation. So, that confirms the answer again. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using a formula derived from solving the recurrence relation, we find that the nth layer is given by (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, but wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3 times the entire expression. So, if the innermost layer is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer is built upon the previous, then the outermost operation is 3 times Layer 9. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually because this could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about whether there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for this kind of nested multiplication. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The formula for L_n is: L_n = a^{n} * (L_0) + b*( (a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1) ) Wait, but actually, since the recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, with L_1 = 4, let's adjust the formula accordingly. The general solution is L_n = a^{n-1} * L_1 + b*( (a^{n-1} - 1)/(a - 1) ). Let me verify that. For n=1: L_1 = 4, which should equal a^{0} * L_1 + b*( (a^{0} -1)/(a-1) ) = 1*4 + b*(0/(a-1)) = 4 + 0 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: a^{1} * L_1 + b*( (a^{1} -1)/(a -1) ) = 3*4 + 1*( (3 -1)/(3-1) ) = 12 + 1*(2/2) = 12 + 1 = 13. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is our Layer 9, we can compute it as: L_9 = 3^{8} * 4 + 1*( (3^{8} -1)/(3 -1) ). Let me compute that. First, 3^8: 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\nSo, 3^8 = 6561. Therefore, L_9 = 6561 * 4 + (6561 -1)/2. Compute each part:\n\n6561 * 4: Let's compute 6561 * 2 = 13122, so 13122 * 2 = 26244.\n\n(6561 -1)/2 = 6560 / 2 = 3280.\n\nSo, L_9 = 26244 + 3280 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Good, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation to find L_9 directly, which would have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since there were only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, although it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake along the way. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything or make a miscalculation:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n2. Label each layer from 1 to 9, starting with Layer 1 as 1 + 3.\n3. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous layer's result into the next.\n4. After computing Layer 9, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n5. Cross-verify using the recurrence relation formula to ensure correctness.\n\nI think that covers everything. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we can efficiently solve the problem.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula or pattern here that can be generalized, which would save time instead of computing each layer. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression: each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApply initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 to a_9, but wait, in our earlier computation, we had a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form formula saved time instead of computing each layer step by step. That's a useful approach for such nested expressions.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that.\n\nThe expression inside each layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)). So, if I denote the innermost part as x, then the next layer is 1 + 3x, then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3x) = 1 + 3 + 9x, and so on. Each time, the coefficient of x is multiplied by 3, and the constants add up in a geometric series.\n\nBut since the expression is finite with 9 layers, it's easier to model it as a recurrence relation as I did earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer adds another power of 3. So, the total expression can be represented as a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by 1, plus an adjustment.\n\nBut perhaps the recurrence approach is the most straightforward here.\n\nSo, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, I found that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon that, leading to the final value of 29524 before multiplying by 3 to get 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me just double-check the final multiplication to be sure: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, breaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number.

Let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 would be 88572. Wait, that's different from 88752. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3: Let's compute each digit again carefully:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. So, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So, 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. So, 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. So, 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, 8.\n\nSo, reading from the top, it's 8 (ten-thousands place), then 8 (thousands), then 7 (hundreds), then 5 (tens), then 2 (units). So, 88,752. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check which one is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition method. Let's do 29524 + 29524 first:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10, carryover 1\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, carryover 1\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, that's 59,048.\n\nNow, adding another 29,524 to 59,048:\n\n59,048 + 29,524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carryover 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n0 + 5 = 5\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carryover 1\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, that's 88,572. So, the correct answer should be 88,572, not 88,752. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my multiplication earlier. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in my initial multiplication, I think I might have misaligned the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n   2 9 5 2 4\n*         3\n-----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, the digits from right to left are 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88,752. But when I added it three times, I got 88,572. There's a conflict here. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the addition as well. Let me check the addition again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits when adding. Let me write it out step by step:\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524:\n\nLet's add each digit:\n\nUnits place: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nTens place: 2 + 2 = 4\n\nHundreds place: 5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carryover 1\n\nThousands place: 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 (carryover) = 19, write down 9, carryover 1\n\nTen-thousands place: 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 (carryover) = 5\n\nSo, the sum is 59,048, which is correct.\n\nNow, adding 59,048 + 29,524:\n\nUnits: 8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\nTens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nHundreds: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1\n\nTen-thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, the sum is 88,572.\n\nWait, so why does the multiplication give me 88,752 and the addition gives me 88,572? There must be an error in one of the methods. Let me check the multiplication again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits when I was writing them down. Let me write the multiplication properly:\n\n   2 9 5 2 4\n*         3\n-----------\nLet me compute each digit step by step.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. So, the number is 88,752. But when I added it three times, I got 88,572. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition. Let me try adding 29,524 three times using another method. 29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, that's consistent with the addition method. Therefore, the correct answer must be 88,572, which means I must have made a mistake in the multiplication method earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing down the multiplication result. Let me check again:\n\n   2 9 5 2 4\n*         3\n------------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, the digits are 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,752. But the addition says it's 88,572. There's a conflict here. I must have made a mistake in either the multiplication or the addition.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me go back to the initial problem. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me recount.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n4. 1 + 3(...)\n5. 1 + 3(...)\n6. 1 + 3(...)\n7. 1 + 3(...)\n8. 1 + 3(...)\n9. 1 + 3(...)\n\nWait, but when I expand it, each layer is one more than the previous. So, if I have 9 layers, then my earlier calculation where I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed each layer step by step, I had Layer 1 as 4, Layer 2 as 13, Layer 3 as 40, Layer 4 as 121, Layer 5 as 364, Layer 6 as 1093, Layer 7 as 3280, Layer 8 as 9841, Layer 9 as 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial multiplication, I thought I got 88,752, but when I added it three times, I got 88,572. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 step by step.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 (ten-thousands place), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). That gives 88,752. But when I added 29,524 three times, I got 88,572. There's a conflict here, so I must have made a mistake in either the multiplication or the addition.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition. Let me try adding 29,524 three times again:\n\nFirst, 29,524 + 29,524:\n\nAdding units: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nTens: 2 + 2 = 4\n\nHundreds: 5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 0, carryover 1\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 9, carryover 1\n\nTen-thousands: 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, sum is 59,048.\n\nNow, adding 59,048 + 29,524:\n\nUnits: 8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\nTens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nHundreds: 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1\n\nTen-thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, the sum is 88,572.\n\nWait, so the addition method is correct, but the multiplication method is giving me 88,752. There's a clear discrepancy here, which means I must have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me check the layers again to ensure that Layer 9 is indeed 29,524.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 should be 88,572, as per the addition method. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the multiplication method earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing down the multiplication result. Let me try again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the digits from right to left are 2,7,5,8,8, which makes 88,752. But this contradicts the addition method. There must be a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the alignment of the digits. Let me write the multiplication properly:\n\n   2 9 5 2 4\n*         3\n------------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. So, the number is 88,752. But this conflicts with the addition result of 88,572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in either the multiplication or the addition.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use another method to verify. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 using expanded form:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nThis confirms that 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, my earlier multiplication method must have had an error. Perhaps I miscounted the digits or made a carryover mistake. To be safe, I'll go with the addition method, which is more reliable in this case.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final answer is 88,572. Therefore, the computed value of the original expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88,572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my computations for each layer because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, which would make the computation faster. Looking at the layers, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches Layer 3. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, if we denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(Layer 9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, E = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572 as the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using a closed-form formula derived from this recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost layer and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3(...).

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just go through my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations. Each layer was computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So, it's a geometric progression, maybe? Wait, let me think about that. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, the solution can be found using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4. So, let's plug in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's plug in n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. On the other hand, using the general formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) and 9A + B = 13 (from n=2). Let's subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression would be 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the recurrence, the final value is calculated as 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Because if any layer is wrong, the final answer will be off.\n\nLet me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So, each step checks out, and the final multiplication is correct. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this computation instead of calculating each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works.\n\nSo, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula also gives me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it wasn't too bad to compute them step by step.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is building a number that's following a specific exponential growth pattern because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the numbers grow quite rapidly, which is why the final result is over 80,000.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n\n3. Verify each computation to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. Once Layer 9 is computed, multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n5. As a check, derive a closed-form formula for the layers using recurrence relations and confirm that it matches the step-by-step computation.\n\n6. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nEach step seems solid, and cross-verifying with the formula gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to represent this expression more concisely, maybe using exponents or another mathematical notation. Since each layer is defined by a recurrence relation, the closed-form formula is a more efficient way to represent it, especially if there were more layers. But for nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad.\n\nIn summary, by methodically working through each nested expression and verifying my steps, I arrived at the solution. It's a good reminder of how important it is to carefully compute each part of a nested expression, especially when dealing with multiple layers of operations.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows the use of a closed-form formula to find the result efficiently. The final answer is obtained by multiplying the result of the outermost layer by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ", so 4*3=12, carryover 1, next digit 2*3=6 +1=7, next 5*3=15, carryover 1, next 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, next 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it down: 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 4*3=12, so 2 with carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit:5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So Layer 1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying initial condition: When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, let me test that formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the innermost layer, n=9, so a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my previous calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the linear recurrence. That's a good check. So, both methods lead me to the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. Using a linear recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which confirms our step-by-step calculation.

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back a bit. Did I compute each layer correctly? Because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct up to Layer 9. Then, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, everything seems to check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that I can apply to verify.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, but wait, actually, in our earlier computation, Layer 1 was a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1, and Layer 9 is a_9.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the total expression might be expressible as a geometric series.

Let me check that again because 29524 * 3 should be 88,572. Let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 88,572 as well. So, that seems right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the computation goes as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer wraps around that, so up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, yes, Layer 9 is 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers, let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*(4)) = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*(13)) = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*(40)) = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*(121)) = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*(364)) = 1,093\n\n7. (1 + 3*(1,093)) = 3,280\n\n8. (1 + 3*(3,280)) = 9,841\n\n9. (1 + 3*(9,841)) = 29,524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, so the outermost expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nHmm, I think that's correct, but let me check one more time by computing each layer again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula for a geometric series or something similar, given the repetitive structure.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and then finding a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous part: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet's verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nWhich matches our earlier result of 88,572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution confirms that the result is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, leading to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form solution, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost and then multiplying the result by 3, we arrive at the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, Layer9 is indeed 29524, and then 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my initial thought process again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, you can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nLooking at each layer, it's of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K =1 => K= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect!

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to a_9. So, the expression is 3*a_9. Now, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have miscalculated. Let's write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify this multiplication another way to be sure. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer 9. So, I think I did that correctly. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication gives 88572. Hmm, but let me think again. The problem is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous, which is similar to a geometric series. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, Layer 1 was 4, which is a_1. Then Layer 2 was 13, which is a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant.\n\nWe can find C by using the initial condition.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3 * a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So,\n\n3 * a_9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nThat's the same result as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the value efficiently. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1) and moving outward:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when you're multiplying step by step, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back and verify each layer to ensure I didn't make any errors in the intermediate steps. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. We can see that this is a recurrence relation. The recurrence relation here is linear, and perhaps we can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. Let me try that. The general form of a linear recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula: L_n = a^n * (L_0) + (a^n - 1)/(a - 1) * b. Wait, let me make sure I have the formula correctly. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*a^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_p. Plugging L_p into the recurrence: L_p = a*L_p + b. Solving for L_p: L_p - a*L_p = b => L_p*(1 - a) = b => L_p = b/(1 - a). Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + L_p. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Wait, but if we're using L_0, maybe we can set n=0. Let me adjust. Let me define L_0 as the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_1 would be 1 + 3*L_0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches our earlier calculation. So, in this case, L_0 = 4. Then, using the formula: L_n = C*3^n + L_p. To find L_p, as above, L_p = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition at n=0: L_0 = 4 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 4 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Wait, but in our earlier step-by-step, we had Layer 1 as 4, which is L_0 in this formula. So, perhaps the layers are offset. Let me clarify. If L_0 = 4, then L_1 = 13, which is correct, and so on. So, the 9th layer, which is the outermost one, would correspond to n=9 in our formula. So, L_9 = (9*3^9 - 1)/2. Let me compute that. First, compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So, 3^9=19683. Then, 9*19683 = let's compute that. 10*19683 = 196,830, so 9*19683 = 196,830 - 19,683 = 177,147. Now, subtract 1: 177,147 - 1 = 177,146. Then, divide by 2: 177,146 / 2 = 88,573. Wait, that's different from our earlier result of 88,572. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Wait, in the formula, L_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (9*3^9 - 1)/2. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n9*19,683 = let's compute 10*19,683 = 196,830; subtract 19,683: 196,830 - 19,683 = 177,147\nNow, subtract 1: 177,147 - 1 = 177,146\nDivide by 2: 177,146 / 2 = 88,573\n\nBut earlier, when I computed step by step, I got Layer 9 as 29,524, and then 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, there's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in either the formula or the step-by-step computation. Let me check my step-by-step computation again. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572. Now, using the formula, I got 88,573, which is off by 1. That suggests that perhaps the formula is slightly off. Alternatively, maybe the initial condition was misapplied. Let me check the formula again. The general solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^n * (L_0 - L_p) + L_p, where L_p = b/(1 - a). In our case, a=3, b=1, so L_p = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. So, L_n = 3^n * (L_0 - (-1/2)) + (-1/2) = 3^n*(L_0 + 1/2) - 1/2. Now, L_0 = 4, so L_n = 3^n*(4 + 1/2) - 1/2 = 3^n*(9/2) - 1/2 = (9*3^n - 1)/2. So, that seems correct. But when n=9, it's (9*19,683 -1)/2 = (177,147 -1)/2 = 177,146/2 = 88,573. However, our step-by-step computation gave us 3*(Layer 9) = 88,572. So, the formula gives 88,573, but the manual computation gives 88,572. There must be a mistake in either the formula application or the manual computation. Let me check the manual computation again. Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer8. Layer8 was 9841, so 3*9841 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Correct. So, the manual computation seems correct. Therefore, the formula must have an off-by-one error. Perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check the formula again. The formula gives L_n = (9*3^n -1)/2. For n=9, it's (9*19,683 -1)/2 = 177,146/2 = 88,573. But the actual Layer9 is 29,524, and 3*Layer9 is 88,572. Wait, so the formula is giving us the value of Layer9 as 88,573, which is incorrect because Layer9 is actually 29,524. Therefore, I must have misapplied the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is for a different indexing. Let me think again. The formula was derived with L_0 = 4, so for n=0, L_0=4. Then, for n=1, L_1=13, which is Layer2. So, in our problem, Layer9 corresponds to n=9, which would be L_9 = (9*3^9 -1)/2 = 88,573. But in reality, Layer9 is 29,524, so perhaps the formula is not directly applicable here because the total expression is 3*(Layer9). So, maybe the formula gives us Layer9, which is 29,524, but according to the formula, Layer9 should be (9*3^9 -1)/2 = 88,573, which is not matching. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the formula approach. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm misapplying it. Let me check for n=0: L_0=4. According to the formula, L_0=(9*3^0 -1)/2=(9*1 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=1, L_1=(9*3^1 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=2, L_2=(9*9 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=3, L_3=(9*27 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works for n=0,1,2,3. Then, for n=9, it should give L_9= (9*19,683 -1)/2=88,573. But according to manual computation, Layer9 is 29,524, which is different. Therefore, I must have misapplied the formula. Wait, perhaps the formula is giving us the value of the entire expression, which is 3*(Layer9), not Layer9 itself. Let me see: If the formula gives L_n = (9*3^n -1)/2, and if n=9, then L_9=88,573. But the expression is 3*(Layer9), which we computed as 88,572. So, 88,573 vs 88,572. They are very close but differ by 1. That suggests that perhaps the formula is off by one somewhere. Alternatively, maybe the formula is correct, and the manual computation has a mistake. Let me check the manual computation again. Layer1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1+3*4=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. 3*29524=88,572. Correct. So, the manual computation seems correct. Therefore, the formula must have a mistake. Wait, perhaps the formula is for the entire expression, not just Layer9. Let me see: If the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), and Layer9 is L_9, then the total expression is 3*L_9. According to the formula, L_n=(9*3^n -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9=(9*3^9 -1)/2=88,573. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9=3*88,573=265,719. But that's not matching with our manual computation of 88,572. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is for the entire expression, not for Layer9. Let me think differently. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps the formula should be adjusted to account for that. Let me redefine the problem. Let E be the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Let me denote the innermost part as Layer1: 1 + 3. Then, Layer2:1 + 3*(Layer1). Up to Layer9:1 + 3*(Layer8). Then, E = 3*(Layer9). So, in terms of the formula, Layer9 = (9*3^9 -1)/2=88,573. Then, E=3*88,573=265,719. But that's not matching with our manual computation. Therefore, perhaps the formula is not applicable here because the formula was derived for Layer9 being the outermost term, but in reality, E is 3*(Layer9), which is an additional multiplication by 3. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be adjusted. Let me think again. The formula gives Layer9 = (9*3^9 -1)/2=88,573. But according to manual computation, Layer9=29,524. So, 88,573 vs 29,524. These are different. Therefore, the formula must have been misapplied. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is for a different number of layers. Let me check: If I use n=8, Layer9 would correspond to n=8? Wait, no, because Layer1 is n=1. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the indices. Let me clarify: If Layer1 is the innermost, which is 1+3=4, then Layer2 is 1+3*4=13, which would be n=2. So, Layer9 would be n=9, which is the outermost. Therefore, the formula gives Layer9= (9*3^9 -1)/2=88,573, but in reality, Layer9=29,524. Therefore, the formula is not matching, which suggests that either the formula is incorrect, or I'm misapplying it. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but the manual computation is wrong. Let me check Layer9 again. Layer8=9841, so Layer9=1 + 3*9841=1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct. So, Layer9=29,524. Then, E=3*29,524=88,572. Therefore, the formula must have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is for a different expression. Let me think about the recurrence again. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + L_p, where L_p= -1/2. Applying L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C=4 + 1/2=9/2 => C=3/2. Therefore, L_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, that's different from what I had before. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the formula. Let me redo the formula correctly. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution is L_p, which satisfies L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p -3L_p=1 => -2L_p=1 => L_p= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition: L_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=3/2. Therefore, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, the correct formula is L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for Layer9, which is n=9, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Correct! That matches our manual computation. Therefore, the formula is L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer9=29,524, and the entire expression E=3*Layer9=3*29,524=88,572. So, the correct answer is 88,572. Therefore, both the step-by-step manual computation and the formula approach now agree. I must have made a mistake earlier in the formula by incorrectly calculating the particular solution or the constant. Now, with the correct formula, Layer9=29,524, and E=88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).

Okay, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the layers are correct up to Layer 9: 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check: is the original expression 3*(Layer 9) or is it something else? Let me look again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, and so on, up to 1+3*Layer8=Layer9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a layer. So, from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. So, the expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer9, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, in case I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation.\n\nI notice that each Layer n is 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, this is a recursive sequence. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for Layer n.\n\nLet me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), whose solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution L_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, L(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the recurrence relation. Let me check for n=1:\n\nL(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula holds. Therefore, L(9)=29524, and 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, after verifying through both step-by-step computation and using a recurrence relation, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By solving each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer's value can be expressed as (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because it's easy to make a mistake in nested computations. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. But maybe I should check one more time to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, that seems to confirm that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute a few layers using the formula to see if it aligns with my earlier computations.\n\nFor example, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct.\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121, correct.\n\na_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\na_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\na_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\na_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\na_9=(3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous step:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So the number is 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high, but considering how many layers there are, it might make sense. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is following a geometric progression or some recursive formula. Let's see: Let me denote each Layer n as L_n.\n\nThen, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps saving time if we have many layers.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that, let's compute Layer 9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we get the same result, which confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is essentially building up a geometric series. Each time you have 1 + 3*(something), which can be seen as adding 1 and then scaling the previous term by 3.\n\nBut regardless, whether by expanding each layer step by step or by recognizing the pattern and using the formula, we arrive at the same final result.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Compute each layer step by step up to the ninth layer, resulting in 29524.\n\n3. Multiply the ninth layer by 3 to get the final result: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, the structure is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I already included the 3*(Layer 8). So, does that mean that the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524?\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression because computing each layer manually could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if the number of layers increases.\n\nLet me think about whether there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested multiplication.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define each layer more formally. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where n is the number of layers. So, for example, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on.\n\nIn general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 would be the innermost expression, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost expression is a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, up to a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, a_1 was 4, a_2 was 13, and so on. So, with a_9 being 29524, and the total expression being 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nThe particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn = 3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn = 4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121.

Therefore, the value after 9 layers is a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to write the entire expression in terms of the formula, it would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, using the formula is much faster and reduces the chance of making a mistake in each layer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 step by step.\n\n3^{10} is 59049.\n\n59049 -1 = 59048.\n\n59048 / 2 = 29524.\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nI think that's solid.

Let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent \"1+3(...)\" adds a layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, it's another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, my initial approach was correct, computing each layer from 1 to 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern. I notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nBut in our case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations with exponents:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^11 is indeed 177147, so (177147 -3)=177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this relation, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final computation of 3 times the ninth layer's value, resulting in 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"
