Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because when I thought about the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm that. From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. Yes, that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each, so 9 eights in the tens place for that last set. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. And fours are 188. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.

Maybe using a formula for counting digits. For each digit position, calculate how many times each digit appears. Let's do that for 4's and 8's separately.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: In each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). So, 48 times, but since 488 is included, we have 48*10=480, plus 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, 4 appears once more at 484. So, total units place: 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\n- Tens place: In each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks of 100, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once in 400-409, but wait, 400-409 is part of the 400-488 range. Wait, no, 400-488 is the hundreds place, but the tens digit in 400-488 is from 0 to 8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place: 40 (from 1-400) +10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers as before. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: Same as before, 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: In each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens place: 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 8's, from 1-400, it's 4 sets of 80-89, which is 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if 480-488 is correct. 480 is included, and 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full sets, and then one more at 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so in the units place, 8 appears at 8,18,...,488. So, how many times? Let's see, 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 times, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, units place for 8's is 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nThus, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers.

When I counted the units place for 4's, I went up to 484, which is the 49th occurrence. For 8's, units place goes up to 488, which is the 49th occurrence as well. But wait, 488 is included, so units place for 8's is correct at 49. For tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 -480 +1=9. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for the last set. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:98. 4's:188. So, difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe hundreds place for 4's would be 89, but let me confirm. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Correct. So, adding up, 49+50+89=188. So, 188 fours, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digit positions, especially in the tens and hundreds, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach. Maybe using a formula or a more systematic way. For counting the number of times a digit appears in each position: For a given digit d and position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as follows. Let's denote the number as N=488. Let's consider each digit position separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in N, plus one if the remainder is >=4.\n   - So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1 more.\n   - So, 48 +1 =49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is equal to the number of complete groups of 100 in N, multiplied by 10, plus the remainder if the tens digit is >=4, adjusted for the current digit.\n   - Wait, maybe a better way: For the tens place, each time the tens digit cycles through 0-9, and for each cycle, 4 appears 10 times.\n   - The number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 488 is in the 400s). So, 4*10=40.\n   - Now, in the current hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. We need to see how many times 4 appears in the tens place here.\n   - From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n   - So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 +10=50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (as calculated before).\n   - So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 488//10=48, remainder 8. Since 8>=8, we add 1.\n   - So, 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n   - Number of complete hundreds:4, so 4*10=40.\n   - In the current hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488: 9 numbers.\n   - So, total tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - As before, no 8's in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 8's. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50.

Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for 8's, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm that. From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, yes, 9 numbers.

    "text": " Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. Now the 8's: Units:49, Tens:49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. When I counted the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last one has only 9 numbers, so 49 in total. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in ranges, you have to be careful about overlapping or missing numbers. Let me check the units place for 4's again. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Correct. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, it's 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct. Tens place for 4's: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1 to 488, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, but in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs once in the 40-49 range. So, 100 numbers have 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would have 4*10=40, but wait, we have 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (up to 400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 4*10 (from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349) plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place, we have 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of terms:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Number of terms:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n   \nTotal 4's:  \n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of terms:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9.  \n   Total:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's:  \n\\[\n49 + 49 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place of 4's, it's from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5*10=50. Correct. Units place for 4's: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...,484. From 0 to 488, how many 4's in units place? The formula is floor((488 +1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48. But wait, 488 is included, so 484 is the last one, which is 484/10=48.4, so 48 full sets, but since 484 is the 49th occurrence, maybe I should think of it as (488 -4)/10 +1 = (484)/10 +1=48.4, which rounds to 48, but actually, 484 is the 49th number. Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate it as (488 +1) //10 = 48.9, which is 48, but since 488 is included, maybe it's 49. Wait, let me think. The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n -6. So, 10n -6 <=488. So, 10n <=494, so n <=49.4, so n=49. So, 49 numbers. So, units place for 4's is 49. That's correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. 188-98=90.
