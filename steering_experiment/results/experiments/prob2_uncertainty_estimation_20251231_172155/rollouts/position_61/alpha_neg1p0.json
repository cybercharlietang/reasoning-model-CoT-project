Wait, when counting the units place for 4's, I included 484, which is correct because it's within 488. For the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. For the 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10.

Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to include or exclude numbers incorrectly. Let me double-check the tens place for 4's. The tens place for 4's is in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers because 489 isn't included. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see, 484 is the 49th term because (484-4)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For 8's in the units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90.

But let me just think again if I considered all cases correctly. Did I miss any numbers?

    "text": " units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the units place for 4's. Let me recount the number of 4's in the units place. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, same calculation: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So that's correct. For the tens place of 4's: from 40-49, 140-149, etc., each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and there are 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? From 0-99: 10 numbers (40-49)\nFrom 100-199:10 (140-149)\nFrom 200-299:10 (240-249)\nFrom 300-399:10 (340-349)\nFrom 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, let's see: 400-409: tens digit 0? Wait, no, 400 is 4-0-0, so the tens digit is 0. Wait, no, I'm confusing the digits. The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, 400 is 4-0-0, so the tens digit is 0, not 4. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 400 is 4 in the hundreds place, 0 in the tens, and 0 in the units. So, the tens digit is 0. So, when does the tens digit become 4? It's when the second digit is 4. So, for example, 40-49: tens digit 4, units digits 0-9.\n\nSimilarly, 140-149: tens digit 4.\n\n240-249: tens digit 4.\n\n340-349: tens digit 4.\n\n440-449: tens digit 4.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, right? Because 400-409: tens digit is 0.\n\n410-419: tens digit is 1.\n\n420-429: tens digit 2.\n\n430-439: tens digit 3.\n\n440-449: tens digit 4.\n\n450-459: tens digit 5.\n\nAnd so on, up to 480-488: tens digit 8, but we're only counting where the tens digit is 4. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding up the tens digit 4's: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. So that's correct. Now, for the hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the 8's, let's check again. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers, as calculated before.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: no 8's, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8's would have some numbers, but since 800-899 is beyond 488, there are none. So, yes, 98 eights.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Alternatively, maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 50. Let me check: each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. There are 5 such blocks up to 400, but wait, actually, up to 400, it's 400, so the blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But since the book only goes to 488, the last block is 401-488. So, in each of the first four blocks, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, there are 10 numbers each with tens digit 4. That's 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens digit 4's:40+10=50. That checks out. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Units place:49. Hundreds:89. Total fours:188.

Wait, in the tens place for 8's, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is included, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 5 sets: 80-89 (10), 180-189(10), 280-289(10), 380-389(10), and 480-488(9). That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that's correct.

Then, in the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. Then, units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 484 is the last one. How many terms? (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That's correct.

Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so it's 10 numbers. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. For 8's: units:8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four is 10 numbers, the last one is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

Hmm, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488-400+1=89. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 sets of 10: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set gives 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Units place for 4's: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1)=484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct. For the 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 +10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9 (480-488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, adding up, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188 fours. And 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Is there any chance I double-counted or missed something? For example, in the tens place for 4's, does 440-449 count as a full set? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so it's included. Similarly, in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is correct as 9 numbers.
