    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 =49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights here. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Specifically, in the 480-488 range, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Each of these has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, adding up, 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189) +10 (280-289) +10 (380-389) +9 (480-488) =49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there.\n\nWait, but when I counted the fours in the units place, I went up to 484, which is correct because 484 is the last number with 4 in the units place before 488. So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\nAdding up, fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct.

Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.), each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9. So total eights in the tens place: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would mean 49 times (since 488 is included). So, units:49. Tens place: 4 in the tens digit occurs in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each hundred block contributes 10, and since we have 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but for the tens place, 440-449 is within that. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, eights: units place. 8,18,...,488. As before, 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for eights. Since the book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So, no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 90.

Wait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, same for 180-189, etc., but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, 4 times 10 is 40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98. Hmm, that's correct because in the hundreds place, there are none. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The question is asking how many more fours are printed than eights, so I subtract 98 from 188. 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights in the page numbers. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place, every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...484. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place, 8,18,28,...488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 49+49=98 eights. 188 fours minus 98 eights is indeed 90. I think that's correct.

Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9.

    "text": " But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's a 90 difference. But let me make sure I didn't overcount somewhere. Let me recount the hundreds place for fours: from 400 to 488 inclusive. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. Units place for fours: 4,14,...484. How many terms? 484 is the 49th term because (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 49 terms. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total eights=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I feel like 90 is a bit high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different method. Let me consider each digit place separately again, but perhaps using a formula. For any digit position, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated using a formula, but since I'm not sure, maybe I can recount. Alternatively, maybe I can think of each digit place for fours and eights and see if I missed anything. Let me try that. For fours: units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the last partial cycle. The last number is 488, so the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct. Tens place: same idea. For the tens digit, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-100: 10 numbers, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-488: how many? Wait, 401-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488. That's 89 numbers, as calculated before. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, for eights: units place. From 1-488, 8 appears in units place every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last partial cycle. The last number is 488, so the units digit is 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct. Tens place: 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: no eights, as before. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems correct. And in the tens place, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place:49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units and tens each have 49, so 98 total. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the units place for fours, I had 484 as the last one, which is 484. So, how many numbers is that? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 484/10=48.4, so 48 full steps, but since we include both endpoints, it's 49 numbers. Similarly, for eights in the units place, 8 to 488 is 49 numbers. So that's correct. For the tens place, fours: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. For eights in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that's correct. So, I think my counts are accurate.

    "text": " But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, so 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks give 4*10=40, and the last block gives 9. So total eights in tens place:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. Eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place of 4's, from 40-49,140-149, etc., each block of 100 has 10, and there are 5 blocks up to 400-499, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50. Units place: every 10 numbers, from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: 484 is 48*10 +4, so 48 full decades, and then one more, making it 49. So, 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: same as fours, 49. Tens place: from 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90.
